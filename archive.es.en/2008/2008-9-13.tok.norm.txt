13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .
still no breakthrough on vat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peter steinbruck opposes the idea of lowering vat rates meanwhile , the eu finance ministers failed to agree on a proposal to reduce vat rates in labour-intensive sectors such as catering or cleaning , saying its impact on jobs and on public accounts required further study .
germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.09.2008 british professor : we are living in a " postdemocracy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin crouch teaches governance and public management at the university of warwick as warwick university professor colin crouch 's book " postdemocracy " appears on shelves in germany , dw-world.de asked him how his theory can shed light on today 's global political events . dw-world.de : governments seem to work for the benefit of multinational companies .
pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy " russia recently changed its government in free elections -lrb- at least nobody contested them loudly -rrb- .
but it seems that it is the prime minister , rather than the president , who rules the country .
the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .

13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .
still no breakthrough on vat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peter steinbruck opposes the idea of lowering vat rates meanwhile , the eu finance ministers failed to agree on a proposal to reduce vat rates in labour-intensive sectors such as catering or cleaning , saying its impact on jobs and on public accounts required further study .
germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the irish rejected the treaty in june , stalling the bloc 's constitutional process . the european commission first objected to the law , which dates back to vw 's privatization in 1960 , in 2004 , and the european court of justice ordered the german federal government to amend the law . in may , berlin put forward an amended law that mccreevy has rejected as it maintains the 20-percent blocking minority for lower saxony . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .
still no breakthrough on vat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peter steinbruck opposes the idea of lowering vat rates meanwhile , the eu finance ministers failed to agree on a proposal to reduce vat rates in labour-intensive sectors such as catering or cleaning , saying its impact on jobs and on public accounts required further study .
germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their bright neon colours and razzmatazz forms intersect in the worlds of fashion and pop art . clara leskovar and doreen schulz have suddenly been catapulted to the ranks of international fashion stardom .
still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .
their style combines pop art and bold geometric razzmatazz patterns in bright neon colours with a repertoire of ready to wear summer frocks , voluminous skirts , leggings and even carpets .
fashion flows into the modern art world .
besides the duo 's prolific collection , which has already emerged on the market , their designs are also being showcased at the museum of decorative arts in berlin . a former nursery school becomes an atelier their atelier however is far from berlin 's fashionable districts .
they deliberately chose a grotty east berlin neighbourhood , where it is easier to be focused on their work , said leskovar .
a former nursery school suffices as an atelier .
besides leskovar and schutz , the 250 square metre -lrb- 2,690 square feet -rrb- space is shared with graphic designers , photographers and advertising personnel .
the berliners enjoy the open working atmosphere , which where the exchange of ideas and inspiration flows .
success follows hard work .
both women already begin their working day at the atelier at 8 a.m. and both are juggling careers with motherhood .
doreen schulz has one child and clara leskovar is expecting one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duo 's colourful designs are a hit abroad , but not at home topstars in japan and us , but dismal results at home in the us , design critics have already billed c-neeon as the “ new bauhaus fashion ” for the splash of fun colours and forms .
sometimes it looks as if the scissors slipped as they were cutting out geometric lines and patterns that wind up being knotted and asymmetrical .
their neon designs in shocking red , blue , green and orange are sold in 25 countries .
in japan , the berlin duo is feted as top stars , but in germany they struggle with the financials . german wardrobes are dominated by conservative greys and blacks , so leskovar and schulz tried to keep the colourless german taste in mind for their third collection in black and white , but that did n't work either . but they are undaunted .
since they emerged with their winter fashion designs in 2004/05 , the berliners have brought out two new collections every year .
the next step will marketing their first carpet collection and poster size images of their designs at a photo gallery . susanne luerweg -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .
still no breakthrough on vat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peter steinbruck opposes the idea of lowering vat rates meanwhile , the eu finance ministers failed to agree on a proposal to reduce vat rates in labour-intensive sectors such as catering or cleaning , saying its impact on jobs and on public accounts required further study .
germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their bright neon colours and razzmatazz forms intersect in the worlds of fashion and pop art . clara leskovar and doreen schulz have suddenly been catapulted to the ranks of international fashion stardom .
still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .
their style combines pop art and bold geometric razzmatazz patterns in bright neon colours with a repertoire of ready to wear summer frocks , voluminous skirts , leggings and even carpets .
fashion flows into the modern art world .
besides the duo 's prolific collection , which has already emerged on the market , their designs are also being showcased at the museum of decorative arts in berlin . a former nursery school becomes an atelier their atelier however is far from berlin 's fashionable districts .
they deliberately chose a grotty east berlin neighbourhood , where it is easier to be focused on their work , said leskovar .
a former nursery school suffices as an atelier .
besides leskovar and schutz , the 250 square metre -lrb- 2,690 square feet -rrb- space is shared with graphic designers , photographers and advertising personnel .
the berliners enjoy the open working atmosphere , which where the exchange of ideas and inspiration flows .
success follows hard work .
both women already begin their working day at the atelier at 8 a.m. and both are juggling careers with motherhood .
doreen schulz has one child and clara leskovar is expecting one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duo 's colourful designs are a hit abroad , but not at home topstars in japan and us , but dismal results at home in the us , design critics have already billed c-neeon as the “ new bauhaus fashion ” for the splash of fun colours and forms .
sometimes it looks as if the scissors slipped as they were cutting out geometric lines and patterns that wind up being knotted and asymmetrical .
their neon designs in shocking red , blue , green and orange are sold in 25 countries .
in japan , the berlin duo is feted as top stars , but in germany they struggle with the financials . german wardrobes are dominated by conservative greys and blacks , so leskovar and schulz tried to keep the colourless german taste in mind for their third collection in black and white , but that did n't work either . but they are undaunted .
since they emerged with their winter fashion designs in 2004/05 , the berliners have brought out two new collections every year .
the next step will marketing their first carpet collection and poster size images of their designs at a photo gallery . susanne luerweg -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when deliberating there on how to prevent another aggression , the task of preventing georgia 's re-militarization will be paramount , " lavrov told a discussion group of russian foreign policy experts , news agency ria-novosti reported . he said the embargo should stand , " at least as long as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili remains in power . " russia is also likely to use its seat on the un security council to seek backing in warnings to the united states not to rearm its georgian ally . but moscow 's refusal to discuss the status of georgia 's two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia and its decision to keep nearly 8,000 troops there has angered the west and raised red flags in europe about the usefulness of peace talks . georgia-russia talks planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov is trying to stop the us from rearming georgia president dmitry medvedev agreed on monday to the talks with georgia in geneva as the last phase of a peace accord won by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the european union 's rotating presidency . russia pledged to withdraw russian troops from checkpoints deep inside the former soviet state to within the boundaries of georgia 's two breakaway regions , but declared 3,800 troops would remain in each region . on the agenda for the peace negotiations , medvedev said monday , was the return of ethnic georgian refugees to war-ravaged south ossetia . the unhcr put that figure at 31,000 in a study released on friday . independence for breakaway regions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy negotiated the ceasefire agreement that stopped the war while peace talks were expected to address unfulfilled commitments to a medvedev-sarkozy ceasefire agreement that stopped the five-day war on aug.12 , russia has drawn a line through talks on the status of georgia 's rebel regions - the last point in the pact . medvedev has said russia 's recognition of the two republics as independent was " final and irrevocable . " " we are n't going to discuss the recognition or status of south ossetia and abkhazia , " lavrov reiterated on friday . nicaragua is the only state to have followed russia 's lead in recognizing the separatist provinces , a move that infuriated georgia and its western allies . but russian media reported this week that israel had ordered a ban on arms sales to georgia out of fear that moscow may retaliate by selling higher grade weapons to its enemies in the middle east , such as syria . russia said israel supplied georgia with spy drones used for reconnaissance ahead of the conflict . dpa news agency -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy " russia recently changed its government in free elections -lrb- at least nobody contested them loudly -rrb- .
but it seems that it is the prime minister , rather than the president , who rules the country .
the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .
but these can never replace formal democracy , weakened though it may become by what i see as post-democratic forces . interview : enrique lópez magallón -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .

the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .

their bright neon colours and razzmatazz forms intersect in the worlds of fashion and pop art . clara leskovar and doreen schulz have suddenly been catapulted to the ranks of international fashion stardom .
still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .
their style combines pop art and bold geometric razzmatazz patterns in bright neon colours with a repertoire of ready to wear summer frocks , voluminous skirts , leggings and even carpets .
fashion flows into the modern art world .
besides the duo 's prolific collection , which has already emerged on the market , their designs are also being showcased at the museum of decorative arts in berlin . a former nursery school becomes an atelier their atelier however is far from berlin 's fashionable districts .
they deliberately chose a grotty east berlin neighbourhood , where it is easier to be focused on their work , said leskovar .
a former nursery school suffices as an atelier .
besides leskovar and schutz , the 250 square metre -lrb- 2,690 square feet -rrb- space is shared with graphic designers , photographers and advertising personnel .
the berliners enjoy the open working atmosphere , which where the exchange of ideas and inspiration flows .
success follows hard work .
both women already begin their working day at the atelier at 8 a.m. and both are juggling careers with motherhood .
doreen schulz has one child and clara leskovar is expecting one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duo 's colourful designs are a hit abroad , but not at home topstars in japan and us , but dismal results at home in the us , design critics have already billed c-neeon as the “ new bauhaus fashion ” for the splash of fun colours and forms .
sometimes it looks as if the scissors slipped as they were cutting out geometric lines and patterns that wind up being knotted and asymmetrical .
their neon designs in shocking red , blue , green and orange are sold in 25 countries .
in japan , the berlin duo is feted as top stars , but in germany they struggle with the financials . german wardrobes are dominated by conservative greys and blacks , so leskovar and schulz tried to keep the colourless german taste in mind for their third collection in black and white , but that did n't work either . but they are undaunted .
since they emerged with their winter fashion designs in 2004/05 , the berliners have brought out two new collections every year .
the next step will marketing their first carpet collection and poster size images of their designs at a photo gallery . susanne luerweg -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .

13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .
still no breakthrough on vat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peter steinbruck opposes the idea of lowering vat rates meanwhile , the eu finance ministers failed to agree on a proposal to reduce vat rates in labour-intensive sectors such as catering or cleaning , saying its impact on jobs and on public accounts required further study .
germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .

germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .

but it seems that it is the prime minister , rather than the president , who rules the country .
the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .
but these can never replace formal democracy , weakened though it may become by what i see as post-democratic forces . interview : enrique lópez magallón -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy " russia recently changed its government in free elections -lrb- at least nobody contested them loudly -rrb- .
but it seems that it is the prime minister , rather than the president , who rules the country .
the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .
but these can never replace formal democracy , weakened though it may become by what i see as post-democratic forces . interview : enrique lópez magallón -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .

germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversial display was protected by a glass wall and security staff , unlike the original one which was completely open to visitors .
madame tussaud 's , a british company , defended its decision to persist with the display against widespread criticism from germans , saying , " hitler represents a decisive part of berlin 's history which we ca n't just pretend did not happen . "

the desk behind which hitler sat was left unoccupied after the beheading while repairs to the figure were carried out .
many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .
the nazi dictator committed suicide in his bunker close by in 1945 .
respectful display ? responding to warnings that it might become a site of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , tussauds depicted hitler as a broken man in his bunker just before his 1945 defeat and death . it is illegal in germany to show nazi symbols and art glorifying hitler and the exhibit was cordoned off to stop visitors posing with him . camera surveillance and museum officials were meant to stop inappropriate behavior . signs nearby asked visitors to refrain from taking photos or posing with hitler " out of respect for the millions of people who died during world war two .

the controversial display was protected by a glass wall and security staff , unlike the original one which was completely open to visitors .
madame tussaud 's , a british company , defended its decision to persist with the display against widespread criticism from germans , saying , " hitler represents a decisive part of berlin 's history which we ca n't just pretend did not happen . "
a beheading at the museum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beheaded figure of hitler was taken out of the museum for repairs a 41-year-old rest-home orderly wrenched the head off the figure on july 5 , a few minutes after the waxworks opened for business in germany .
the desk behind which hitler sat was left unoccupied after the beheading while repairs to the figure were carried out .
many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .
the nazi dictator committed suicide in his bunker close by in 1945 .
respectful display ? responding to warnings that it might become a site of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , tussauds depicted hitler as a broken man in his bunker just before his 1945 defeat and death . it is illegal in germany to show nazi symbols and art glorifying hitler and the exhibit was cordoned off to stop visitors posing with him . camera surveillance and museum officials were meant to stop inappropriate behavior . signs nearby asked visitors to refrain from taking photos or posing with hitler " out of respect for the millions of people who died during world war two .

13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .
still no breakthrough on vat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister peter steinbruck opposes the idea of lowering vat rates meanwhile , the eu finance ministers failed to agree on a proposal to reduce vat rates in labour-intensive sectors such as catering or cleaning , saying its impact on jobs and on public accounts required further study .
germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , foreign minister sergei lavrov said . " when deliberating there on how to prevent another aggression , the task of preventing georgia 's re-militarization will be paramount , " lavrov told a discussion group of russian foreign policy experts , news agency ria-novosti reported . he said the embargo should stand , " at least as long as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili remains in power .

the controversial display was protected by a glass wall and security staff , unlike the original one which was completely open to visitors .

many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .
the nazi dictator committed suicide in his bunker close by in 1945 .
respectful display ? responding to warnings that it might become a site of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , tussauds depicted hitler as a broken man in his bunker just before his 1945 defeat and death . it is illegal in germany to show nazi symbols and art glorifying hitler and the exhibit was cordoned off to stop visitors posing with him . camera surveillance and museum officials were meant to stop inappropriate behavior . signs nearby asked visitors to refrain from taking photos or posing with hitler " out of respect for the millions of people who died during world war two .

the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "

steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "

13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .

germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia is also likely to use its seat on the un security council to seek backing in warnings to the united states not to rearm its georgian ally . but moscow 's refusal to discuss the status of georgia 's two breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia and its decision to keep nearly 8,000 troops there has angered the west and raised red flags in europe about the usefulness of peace talks . georgia-russia talks planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lavrov is trying to stop the us from rearming georgia president dmitry medvedev agreed on monday to the talks with georgia in geneva as the last phase of a peace accord won by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the european union 's rotating presidency . russia pledged to withdraw russian troops from checkpoints deep inside the former soviet state to within the boundaries of georgia 's two breakaway regions , but declared 3,800 troops would remain in each region . on the agenda for the peace negotiations , medvedev said monday , was the return of ethnic georgian refugees to war-ravaged south ossetia . the unhcr put that figure at 31,000 in a study released on friday . independence for breakaway regions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy negotiated the ceasefire agreement that stopped the war while peace talks were expected to address unfulfilled commitments to a medvedev-sarkozy ceasefire agreement that stopped the five-day war on aug.12 , russia has drawn a line through talks on the status of georgia 's rebel regions - the last point in the pact . medvedev has said russia 's recognition of the two republics as independent was " final and irrevocable . " " we are n't going to discuss the recognition or status of south ossetia and abkhazia , " lavrov reiterated on friday . nicaragua is the only state to have followed russia 's lead in recognizing the separatist provinces , a move that infuriated georgia and its western allies . but russian media reported this week that israel had ordered a ban on arms sales to georgia out of fear that moscow may retaliate by selling higher grade weapons to its enemies in the middle east , such as syria . russia said israel supplied georgia with spy drones used for reconnaissance ahead of the conflict . dpa news agency -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the irish rejected the treaty in june , stalling the bloc 's constitutional process . the european commission first objected to the law , which dates back to vw 's privatization in 1960 , in 2004 , and the european court of justice ordered the german federal government to amend the law . in may , berlin put forward an amended law that mccreevy has rejected as it maintains the 20-percent blocking minority for lower saxony . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy " russia recently changed its government in free elections -lrb- at least nobody contested them loudly -rrb- .
but it seems that it is the prime minister , rather than the president , who rules the country .
the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .
but these can never replace formal democracy , weakened though it may become by what i see as post-democratic forces . interview : enrique lópez magallón -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy " russia recently changed its government in free elections -lrb- at least nobody contested them loudly -rrb- .

the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .

their bright neon colours and razzmatazz forms intersect in the worlds of fashion and pop art . clara leskovar and doreen schulz have suddenly been catapulted to the ranks of international fashion stardom .
still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .
their style combines pop art and bold geometric razzmatazz patterns in bright neon colours with a repertoire of ready to wear summer frocks , voluminous skirts , leggings and even carpets .
fashion flows into the modern art world .
besides the duo 's prolific collection , which has already emerged on the market , their designs are also being showcased at the museum of decorative arts in berlin . a former nursery school becomes an atelier their atelier however is far from berlin 's fashionable districts .
they deliberately chose a grotty east berlin neighbourhood , where it is easier to be focused on their work , said leskovar .
a former nursery school suffices as an atelier .
besides leskovar and schutz , the 250 square metre -lrb- 2,690 square feet -rrb- space is shared with graphic designers , photographers and advertising personnel .
the berliners enjoy the open working atmosphere , which where the exchange of ideas and inspiration flows .
success follows hard work .
both women already begin their working day at the atelier at 8 a.m. and both are juggling careers with motherhood .
doreen schulz has one child and clara leskovar is expecting one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duo 's colourful designs are a hit abroad , but not at home topstars in japan and us , but dismal results at home in the us , design critics have already billed c-neeon as the “ new bauhaus fashion ” for the splash of fun colours and forms .
sometimes it looks as if the scissors slipped as they were cutting out geometric lines and patterns that wind up being knotted and asymmetrical .
their neon designs in shocking red , blue , green and orange are sold in 25 countries .
in japan , the berlin duo is feted as top stars , but in germany they struggle with the financials . german wardrobes are dominated by conservative greys and blacks , so leskovar and schulz tried to keep the colourless german taste in mind for their third collection in black and white , but that did n't work either . but they are undaunted .
since they emerged with their winter fashion designs in 2004/05 , the berliners have brought out two new collections every year .
the next step will marketing their first carpet collection and poster size images of their designs at a photo gallery . susanne luerweg -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy " russia recently changed its government in free elections -lrb- at least nobody contested them loudly -rrb- .
but it seems that it is the prime minister , rather than the president , who rules the country .
the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .

13 , that " measures designed to restore confidence through transparency and the responsibility of the actors will be put in place without delay . "
the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "
huge losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' shares were in free fall as investors lost confidence amid mounting losses the nice meeting was also attended by the governor of the italian central bank , mario draghi , who also chairs the financial stability forum , which groups central bankers and regulators from the world 's leading economies .
draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .
the figure was higher than previously thought .
us giants lehman brothers holdings inc. have become the latest victims of the credit squeeze .
lehman 's shares fell by 40 percent on thursday and by another 13.5 percent on friday after announcing its biggest ever loss on wednesday .

germany 's finance minister , peer steinbruck , told reporters that about eight of the eu 's 27 member states had sided with the german decision to oppose the european commission 's plans .
steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "
but saturday 's debate has helped " break this deadlock " , and there are enough past examples within the eu to suggest that a unanimous agreement is possible , kovacs said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .
their style combines pop art and bold geometric razzmatazz patterns in bright neon colours with a repertoire of ready to wear summer frocks , voluminous skirts , leggings and even carpets .

still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .
their style combines pop art and bold geometric razzmatazz patterns in bright neon colours with a repertoire of ready to wear summer frocks , voluminous skirts , leggings and even carpets .
fashion flows into the modern art world .
besides the duo 's prolific collection , which has already emerged on the market , their designs are also being showcased at the museum of decorative arts in berlin . a former nursery school becomes an atelier their atelier however is far from berlin 's fashionable districts .

the eu 's internal market commissioner , charlie mccreevy , is due to unveil a set of proposals aimed at improving the transparency of financial market operators in october .
though details are as yet unclear , the proposals are expected to include a set of requirements for credit rating agencies wishing to operate in the eu .
in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .
while noting that transparency was " improving " , lagarde said " we need to reach 100 percent . "

draghi was reported on friday as saying that the world 's banks may need at least $ 350 billion -lrb- 246 billion euros -rrb- of fresh capital to counter the losses resulting from the global credit crunch sparked by the us subprime mortgage crisis .

steinbruck estimated germany 's tax revenue losses as a result of the proposal at 12.5 billion euros .
he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .
but european commissioner laszlo kovacs , the brussels official in charge of taxation who tabled the latest proposal in july , said he was still confident that the unanimity needed to approve tax-related measures such as this could still be reached .
" it is evident that there are two schools of thought , " kovacs said , " and it is true that there has been an endless debate that has resulted in a deadlock . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.09.2008 british professor : we are living in a " postdemocracy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin crouch teaches governance and public management at the university of warwick as warwick university professor colin crouch 's book " postdemocracy " appears on shelves in germany , dw-world.de asked him how his theory can shed light on today 's global political events . dw-world.de : governments seem to work for the benefit of multinational companies .
pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?

pr experts rule the level and content of the public debate .
parliaments have been invaded by lobbies .
does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .

does n't all that constitute , at least technically speaking , the end of democracy as we know it ?
colin crouch : governments in countries where democratic institutions are strong can not work solely for multinational corporations and pr experts can not control all debate .
where governments have to face seriously contested elections , it is not possible to ignore the needs of ordinary people .
indeed , one reason why business has such political power is that governments depend on economic success to satisfy people 's needs , and business seems to hold the answers to that success .
pr experts can not completely control debate where civil society outside the official political world is strong and vigorous .
my book " postdemocracy " is concerned with societies where democratic institutions are strong , and is about problems that occur for democracy within and despite that strength .
the same forces that you mention - mncs , clever pr - in a polity where democracy is young , with shallow root , would be far more damaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does pr affect democracy ?
in the “ golden age ” of ancient greece , pericles promoted democracy while in the country slavery prevailed .
since then , democracy has always been accompanied by contradiction .
in that sense , would n't all the factors you describe as “ postdemocratic ” really be a part of the natural evolution of democracy ?
the meaning of democracy depends on the definition of the " demos , " the people .
until the early 20th century , women were routinely excluded from the " demos " in societies which otherwise saw themselves as democratic .
today we exclude people below a certain age , foreigners living in the country , and sometimes -lrb- as in the usa -rrb- people with certain criminal records .
debates about the inclusiveness of democracy are different from those about the quality of democracy - and it is the latter with which i am concerned .
some of the symptoms described in your book are present in latin america without a previous truly consolidated , democratic phase in the region .
there has been no “ parabolic ” democratic development there and it seems , however , that post-democracy has also arrived in most latin american countries .
how would you explain that ?
some of the factors producing post-democracy might arrive in some societies without strong democracy .
when the existing established democracies were acquiring their institutions such forces as global capital and sophisticated pr did not exist .
it certainly makes life harder for young democracies - in latin america , eastern and central europe , parts of asia - that these forces are already present .
is it being too cynical to wonder if the current enthusiasm for promoting democracy around the world , on the part of the western powers , is partly the result of confidence that today democracy can be effectively controlled ?
you say that pr experts have taken control over the political debate , mostly during election campaigns .
could you give an example of this in relation to the current us race between barack obama and john mccain ?
us electoral politics is so completely a set of media events that it is difficult to identify moments that are not pr-controlled .
one consequence of this is that journalists - who really resent pr control of their work - are constantly seeking the slips of the tongue , the dirty little secrets that escape the pr machine .
one thinks of incidents like mccain forgetting how many houses he owned -lrb- seven , in fact -rrb- , and obama 's embarrassing preacher friend .
but these things lead in turn to excessive attention being paid to unimportant little incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy " russia recently changed its government in free elections -lrb- at least nobody contested them loudly -rrb- .
but it seems that it is the prime minister , rather than the president , who rules the country .
the caucasus crisis destabilized the region and also had consequences for eu policy .
do you see a “ postdemocratic ” background in this sequence of events involving russia ?
russia is a case of very , very imperfect democracy , not of post-democracy .
there has never been a period of democratic strength in all russian history .
what about the apparent tolerance of the european union towards the increasingly authoritarian regime in russia ?
are there also " postdemocratic " elements ?
relations between countries rarely have a moral basis .
they are rooted in strategic and economic interests .
this has always been true and is not really a part of post-democracy .
your book gives the strong general impression that current democracy is not in a good shape , and not only in poorer countries , but also in developed ones .
in this regard , my last question is rather simple : does democracy have a future ?
the purpose of writing a dystopia is to warn of coming dangers so that people might take action to avoid what is coming .
to do that one has to be an optimist .
but i see hope , not so much in a renewal of electoral democracy and political parties , but in the growth of a strong civil society - with alert citizens and social movements who challenge the misuse of political and economic power in a whole range of ways .
but these can never replace formal democracy , weakened though it may become by what i see as post-democratic forces . interview : enrique lópez magallón -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .

their bright neon colours and razzmatazz forms intersect in the worlds of fashion and pop art . clara leskovar and doreen schulz have suddenly been catapulted to the ranks of international fashion stardom .
still in their early thirties , the two berlin designers , who had first collaborated together at the school of art and design in berlin weissensee , joined forces to create their label c.neeon in 2004 .
the “ c ” stands for clara and “ neon ” was schulz 's childhood nickname .
their style combines pop art and bold geometric razzmatazz patterns in bright neon colours with a repertoire of ready to wear summer frocks , voluminous skirts , leggings and even carpets .
fashion flows into the modern art world .
besides the duo 's prolific collection , which has already emerged on the market , their designs are also being showcased at the museum of decorative arts in berlin . a former nursery school becomes an atelier their atelier however is far from berlin 's fashionable districts .
they deliberately chose a grotty east berlin neighbourhood , where it is easier to be focused on their work , said leskovar .
a former nursery school suffices as an atelier .
besides leskovar and schutz , the 250 square metre -lrb- 2,690 square feet -rrb- space is shared with graphic designers , photographers and advertising personnel .
the berliners enjoy the open working atmosphere , which where the exchange of ideas and inspiration flows .
success follows hard work .
both women already begin their working day at the atelier at 8 a.m. and both are juggling careers with motherhood .
doreen schulz has one child and clara leskovar is expecting one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duo 's colourful designs are a hit abroad , but not at home topstars in japan and us , but dismal results at home in the us , design critics have already billed c-neeon as the “ new bauhaus fashion ” for the splash of fun colours and forms .
sometimes it looks as if the scissors slipped as they were cutting out geometric lines and patterns that wind up being knotted and asymmetrical .
their neon designs in shocking red , blue , green and orange are sold in 25 countries .
in japan , the berlin duo is feted as top stars , but in germany they struggle with the financials . german wardrobes are dominated by conservative greys and blacks , so leskovar and schulz tried to keep the colourless german taste in mind for their third collection in black and white , but that did n't work either . but they are undaunted .
since they emerged with their winter fashion designs in 2004/05 , the berliners have brought out two new collections every year .
the next step will marketing their first carpet collection and poster size images of their designs at a photo gallery . susanne luerweg -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in nice , german finance minister peer steinbruck said his government backed plans by france , the current holder of the eu presidency , to improve cooperation between national agencies which supervise banks and insurance companies .
his french colleague , christine lagarde , said 80 percent of banks had so far complied with the eu 's disclosure requirements .

the irish rejected the treaty in june , stalling the bloc 's constitutional process . the european commission first objected to the law , which dates back to vw 's privatization in 1960 , in 2004 , and the european court of justice ordered the german federal government to amend the law . in may , berlin put forward an amended law that mccreevy has rejected as it maintains the 20-percent blocking minority for lower saxony . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversial display was protected by a glass wall and security staff , unlike the original one which was completely open to visitors .

he said a small country like denmark would stand to lose as much as 1 billion euros .

the derby playhouse went into liquidation and was forced to close its doors seven months ago while a rescue package was organised .
the killing of sister george on saturday evening is the first play at the venue since early in the year .
playhouse board chairman jonathan powers said 75 % of the tickets for the play had already been sold .
the theatre was initially forced to close late in 2007 after funding problems and arguments with the city council over management , although it reopened for several weeks for a christmas show .
new performances were announced after a £ 300,000 rescue package was agreed with the administrators .
karen hebden , acting executive director , said : " our audience will stay with us - they bought £ 20,000 worth of tickets in the first five days and if they keep buying tickets we will stay open . "
the current season is planned to run until the end of february .

the derby playhouse went into liquidation and was forced to close its doors seven months ago while a rescue package was organised .
the killing of sister george on saturday evening is the first play at the venue since early in the year .
playhouse board chairman jonathan powers said 75 % of the tickets for the play had already been sold .
the theatre was initially forced to close late in 2007 after funding problems and arguments with the city council over management , although it reopened for several weeks for a christmas show .
new performances were announced after a £ 300,000 rescue package was agreed with the administrators .
karen hebden , acting executive director , said : " our audience will stay with us - they bought £ 20,000 worth of tickets in the first five days and if they keep buying tickets we will stay open . "
the current season is planned to run until the end of february .

those responsible would be " severely " punished , he added .
later , it was announced that 19 people had been arrested .

gao qiang said the sanlu group had been ordered to halt production after its products were found to be responsible .
" we will severely punish and discipline those people and workers who have acted illegally , " mr gao said .
melamine is a toxic chemical used in plastics , fertilisers and cleaning products .
sanlu ordered a recall of 700 tonnes of contaminated milk on thursday new zealand-based dairy product company fonterra cooperative group ltd , a part-owner of sanlu , ordered a recall of about 700 tonnes of powder contaminated with melamine believed to be in circulation .
melamine has been used by chinese suppliers of animal feed components to make them appear to have more protein .
it was linked to the formation of kidney stones and kidney failure in pets in the united states last year , leading to thousands of deaths and illnesses .
a fake milk powder scandal in 2004 killed at least 13 babies in the eastern province of anhui .
investigators found that the milk given to these babies had no nutritional value , and the resulting scandal triggered widespread investigations into food safety .
