us treasury secretary henry paulson said on sunday some countries had signaled their readiness to help out , but there had been no firm commitments .
plan aims to head off credit freeze the us rescue plan , which must still be passed by congress , would give the treasury department the power to buy bad mortgage debts from troubled financial institutes to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could bring the international finance system to its knees .

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .

a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .
first , in an unheard-of move , the wife of bavarian premier guenther beckstein showed up to open the festivities dressed not in a dirndl , but in a - gasp - suit .
so what if the jacket had that loden-green piping that shouts bavaria from 100 paces away ?
so what if the frowsy , middle-aged first lady marga beckstein may have just been trying to avoid a replay of the hulabaloo that followed angela merkel after she showed too much cleavage at the opera ? the wives of german politicians , especially prominent right-wing german politicians , are expected to follow tradition .
and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .
if that was n't enough , traditional german dress took another blow when the wife of another great german leader - this time the premier of formula one racing - showed up in a dirndl that looked like it had been designed to be worn backstage at a grateful dead concert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's what real dirndls look like , traditionalists would argue in germany , the dirndl is just one aspect of a broader clothing style known as trachten , which many southern germans wear as their " sunday best . "
while the dress is generally a low-cut and tightly laced affair , it also represents a conservative style .
but in a move that seemed designed to " epater les bourgeouis , " cora schumacher , the fashionable wife of formula one driver and german national hero michael schumacher , wore a dirndl whose fire-engine-red apron had a black skull embroidered on it .
the low-cut black-and-white blouse had a skull-and-bones pattern as well .
locals were shocked , but lady schumi defended her choice .
" i am crazy about them !
i just love skulls plain and simple , " she told spiegel online .
" death is part of life .
and i feel like skulls are totally my good luck charm . "
indeed , cora schumacher is known for wearing skull accessories , including earrings , t-shirts , bags , belts , a leather jacket with a skull made out of rivets by designer thomas wylde , and even a diamond-studded watch with little skulls on it , apparently valued at 50,000 euros . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 22.09.2008 un watchdog examines iran 's nuclear activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has argued for iran 's right to nuclear power questions concerning iran 's past nuclear activities and syria 's alleged secret nuclear program are expected to dominate a week-long meeting of the international atomic energy agency board that opened in vienna on monday . the 35-member iaea board of governors is set to discuss iran 's lack of cooperation in explaining a set of past studies , which the international nuclear watchdog says could be related to an effort to develop nuclear weapons .
iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .
syrian nuclear activities under the microscope on monday , el baradei is also set to give board members an interim report on syria , which is suspected of having secretly built a nuclear reactor , possibly with north korean help .
iaea inspectors took samples at the alleged site in june , which was bombed by israeli warplanes last year .
diplomats said last week that results were still outstanding and no final assessment would be possible unless syria gives the iaea access to further sites . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .

while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "

a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .
syrian nuclear activities under the microscope on monday , el baradei is also set to give board members an interim report on syria , which is suspected of having secretly built a nuclear reactor , possibly with north korean help .

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .
first , in an unheard-of move , the wife of bavarian premier guenther beckstein showed up to open the festivities dressed not in a dirndl , but in a - gasp - suit .
so what if the jacket had that loden-green piping that shouts bavaria from 100 paces away ?
so what if the frowsy , middle-aged first lady marga beckstein may have just been trying to avoid a replay of the hulabaloo that followed angela merkel after she showed too much cleavage at the opera ? the wives of german politicians , especially prominent right-wing german politicians , are expected to follow tradition .
and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .

" i am crazy about them !
i just love skulls plain and simple , " she told spiegel online .
" death is part of life .

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .
first , in an unheard-of move , the wife of bavarian premier guenther beckstein showed up to open the festivities dressed not in a dirndl , but in a - gasp - suit .
so what if the jacket had that loden-green piping that shouts bavaria from 100 paces away ?
so what if the frowsy , middle-aged first lady marga beckstein may have just been trying to avoid a replay of the hulabaloo that followed angela merkel after she showed too much cleavage at the opera ? the wives of german politicians , especially prominent right-wing german politicians , are expected to follow tradition .
and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .
if that was n't enough , traditional german dress took another blow when the wife of another great german leader - this time the premier of formula one racing - showed up in a dirndl that looked like it had been designed to be worn backstage at a grateful dead concert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's what real dirndls look like , traditionalists would argue in germany , the dirndl is just one aspect of a broader clothing style known as trachten , which many southern germans wear as their " sunday best . "
while the dress is generally a low-cut and tightly laced affair , it also represents a conservative style .
but in a move that seemed designed to " epater les bourgeouis , " cora schumacher , the fashionable wife of formula one driver and german national hero michael schumacher , wore a dirndl whose fire-engine-red apron had a black skull embroidered on it .
the low-cut black-and-white blouse had a skull-and-bones pattern as well .
locals were shocked , but lady schumi defended her choice .
" i am crazy about them !
i just love skulls plain and simple , " she told spiegel online .
" death is part of life .
and i feel like skulls are totally my good luck charm . "
indeed , cora schumacher is known for wearing skull accessories , including earrings , t-shirts , bags , belts , a leather jacket with a skull made out of rivets by designer thomas wylde , and even a diamond-studded watch with little skulls on it , apparently valued at 50,000 euros . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us treasury secretary henry paulson said on sunday some countries had signaled their readiness to help out , but there had been no firm commitments .
plan aims to head off credit freeze the us rescue plan , which must still be passed by congress , would give the treasury department the power to buy bad mortgage debts from troubled financial institutes to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could bring the international finance system to its knees .
finance minister steinbrueck added that the us plans were very important to stabilizing markets .

eu spokesman johannes laitenberger said the eu executive " welcomes u.s. action to stabilize the financial system " and would continue to follow the situation closely and attentively .
but he would not comment on the details of the plan because the situation is still evolving , he said .
after paulson called on other countries to come up with similar plans to help stabilize the global financial system , laitenberger said this is " not a question that falls directly under the commission 's competence . "
merkel wants tighter regulation german chancellor angela merkel on monday reiterated calls for more transparency and tighter regulation of markets . over the weekend , the chancellor was unusually critical of the us for failing to heed calls to improve regulation of hedge funds and implement more stringent financial controls . german politicians remain wary of the us bailout and have ruled out any participation . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

21 , by saying the government had refused to allow the opposition to sit on regional election commissions , thus depriving them of the chance to monitor the vote .
lukashenko , criticized by human rights groups in his homeland as " europe 's last dictator , " said belarus had strictly adhered to the guidelines laid down by the west in preparing the elections .
on saturday , the president , who has been in power since 1994 , threatened to place relations with the west on ice if it declares the sept .
28 polls undemocratic .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the six group of seven economic powers aside from the united states do not plan any measures comparable to a us package to support the banking sector , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on monday .
ulrich wilhelm , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , too said the government saw no need for such an undertaking in germany .
us reportedly seeking help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other countries to create similar resecue plans a foreign ministry spokesman said the us had not approached europeans on the issue so far . the us administration reportedly wants other countries to come up with rescue plans similar to a $ 700 billion -lrb- 480 billion euro -rrb- rescue package announced in washington on sunday .
us treasury secretary henry paulson said on sunday some countries had signaled their readiness to help out , but there had been no firm commitments .
plan aims to head off credit freeze the us rescue plan , which must still be passed by congress , would give the treasury department the power to buy bad mortgage debts from troubled financial institutes to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could bring the international finance system to its knees .
finance minister steinbrueck added that the us plans were very important to stabilizing markets .
there is no reason to fear a credit crunch in germany , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us drew the line at a lehman brothers rescue the us government lurched from one crisis to another last week , standing by as lehman brothers investment bank declared its $ 600 billion bankruptcy and as merrill lynch investment bank was swallowed up by bank of america .
it then stepped in to rescue the insurance giant american international group inc -lrb- aig -rrb- to the tune of $ 85 billion .
markets not only in the us but around the world fluctuated wildly but returned to about where they had been at the beginning of the week after news of the rescue package emerged .
eu welcomes bailout plan the eu commission welcomed the bailout plan when it was announced .
eu spokesman johannes laitenberger said the eu executive " welcomes u.s. action to stabilize the financial system " and would continue to follow the situation closely and attentively .
but he would not comment on the details of the plan because the situation is still evolving , he said .
after paulson called on other countries to come up with similar plans to help stabilize the global financial system , laitenberger said this is " not a question that falls directly under the commission 's competence . "
merkel wants tighter regulation german chancellor angela merkel on monday reiterated calls for more transparency and tighter regulation of markets . over the weekend , the chancellor was unusually critical of the us for failing to heed calls to improve regulation of hedge funds and implement more stringent financial controls . german politicians remain wary of the us bailout and have ruled out any participation . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 22.09.2008 raf victim 's son complains about new baader-meinhof film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the baader-meinhof complex " has been criticized by relatives of raf victims the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered by the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in 1977 , has complained in an interview about the new film about the baader-meinhof group responsible for his father ’ s death . michael buback criticized " the baader-meinhof complex " by producer bernd eichinger in sunday 's die welt , saying that he and other relatives of those killed by the german terrorist organization had not been informed of the contents of the film .
" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "

" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .

the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .

" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .
film aims to end raf terrorist chic there have been plenty of movies about baader , meinhof and the raf but the militants have sometimes been portrayed as cool , leather- jacketed revolutionaries with pistols tucked into their belts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf exhibition was seen as glorifying the group more than 30 years after the events , young people in germany can now flirt with terrorist chic by buying t-shirts with the raf 's trademark machine-gun emblem and there have been exhibitions about baader and meinhof as pop icons .
aust 's book has been thoroughly revised to coincide with the release of the film but many raf terrorists released from jail in recent years have refused to talk to him about what happened .
key documents on the era have also not been released by the german government .
christian klar , 56 , one of the most notorious raf members , is still serving a prison sentence for multiple murders after his recent appeals for clemency were turned down .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .

merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.09.2008 germany to end financial development aid for china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will not be giving any more development money to fast-rising china germany 's development ministry is ending all financial aid to china , a spokesman said monday , following complaints that china is rich enough to fund its own projects . the announcement comes after a series of discussions between german lawmakers this year which focused on the relevance of providing china , a fast-rising economic power , with development aid .
many have argued that china no longer needs german economic aid - particularly at a time when berlin is keeping a close eye on spending in an effort to balance its budget .
germany 's opposition free democrats welcomed the move , saying china had a very strong economy and did not need financial aid or low-interest credits .
" we will in future concentrate on a strategic partnership of the whole government with china , in order to move forward reform processes there in justice , society and climate protection , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul said in an interview with the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
the refocusing of the arrangement would " end classic financial cooperation , " she added .
" we want to encourage dialogue and consultation and the expansion of business partnerships , " zeul said .
germany re-assessing development spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul announced a change to a more advisory role stephan bethe , wieczorek-zeul 's spokesperson , issued a statement which pointed to environmental protection , renewable energy and energy efficiency as possible areas for future advisory cooperation .

many have argued that china no longer needs german economic aid - particularly at a time when berlin is keeping a close eye on spending in an effort to balance its budget .
germany 's opposition free democrats welcomed the move , saying china had a very strong economy and did not need financial aid or low-interest credits .
" we will in future concentrate on a strategic partnership of the whole government with china , in order to move forward reform processes there in justice , society and climate protection , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul said in an interview with the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
the refocusing of the arrangement would " end classic financial cooperation , " she added .

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .

and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .

while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .

a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.09.2008 opinion : the war on terror ca n't be won by military might alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's thomas baerthlein says political , not military , solutions are what pakistan needs after a suicide bomber killed more than 50 lpeople at an islamabad hotel . the suicide bombing at the marriott hotel in islamabad on saturday , sept .
20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .

in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .

they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .

land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .

zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many have argued that china no longer needs german economic aid - particularly at a time when berlin is keeping a close eye on spending in an effort to balance its budget .
germany 's opposition free democrats welcomed the move , saying china had a very strong economy and did not need financial aid or low-interest credits .
" we will in future concentrate on a strategic partnership of the whole government with china , in order to move forward reform processes there in justice , society and climate protection , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul said in an interview with the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
the refocusing of the arrangement would " end classic financial cooperation , " she added .
" we want to encourage dialogue and consultation and the expansion of business partnerships , " zeul said .
germany re-assessing development spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul announced a change to a more advisory role stephan bethe , wieczorek-zeul 's spokesperson , issued a statement which pointed to environmental protection , renewable energy and energy efficiency as possible areas for future advisory cooperation .
he added that he could not yet say on what scale that cooperation would be .
germany has yet to make any development aid pledges for this year or next after pumping 67.5 million -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- into china in 2007 .
china looking for long term cooperation earlier this month , chinese vice premier li keqiang met with minister of finance peer steinbrueck for talks on economic cooperation .
li told steinbrueck that china valued its relations with germany and would promote the relationship from a " strategic , long-term perspective , " adding that china and germany had enjoyed fruitful cooperation since establishing diplomatic ties 36 years ago .
the vice premier said china 's economy had undergone challenges and tests but still showed " stable and rapid development . "
steinbrueck reiterated that germany attached importance to relations with china and would continue to enhance the relationship . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .

merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .

schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?

many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 22.09.2008 un watchdog examines iran 's nuclear activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has argued for iran 's right to nuclear power questions concerning iran 's past nuclear activities and syria 's alleged secret nuclear program are expected to dominate a week-long meeting of the international atomic energy agency board that opened in vienna on monday . the 35-member iaea board of governors is set to discuss iran 's lack of cooperation in explaining a set of past studies , which the international nuclear watchdog says could be related to an effort to develop nuclear weapons .
iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .

powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .

" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .

" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .
film aims to end raf terrorist chic there have been plenty of movies about baader , meinhof and the raf but the militants have sometimes been portrayed as cool , leather- jacketed revolutionaries with pistols tucked into their belts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf exhibition was seen as glorifying the group more than 30 years after the events , young people in germany can now flirt with terrorist chic by buying t-shirts with the raf 's trademark machine-gun emblem and there have been exhibitions about baader and meinhof as pop icons .
aust 's book has been thoroughly revised to coincide with the release of the film but many raf terrorists released from jail in recent years have refused to talk to him about what happened .
key documents on the era have also not been released by the german government .
christian klar , 56 , one of the most notorious raf members , is still serving a prison sentence for multiple murders after his recent appeals for clemency were turned down .
his call for mercy while showing no remorse provoked a nationwide emotional debate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de journalist stefan aust : baader-meinhof film reflects raf reality journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people .

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .
first , in an unheard-of move , the wife of bavarian premier guenther beckstein showed up to open the festivities dressed not in a dirndl , but in a - gasp - suit .
so what if the jacket had that loden-green piping that shouts bavaria from 100 paces away ?
so what if the frowsy , middle-aged first lady marga beckstein may have just been trying to avoid a replay of the hulabaloo that followed angela merkel after she showed too much cleavage at the opera ? the wives of german politicians , especially prominent right-wing german politicians , are expected to follow tradition .
and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .
if that was n't enough , traditional german dress took another blow when the wife of another great german leader - this time the premier of formula one racing - showed up in a dirndl that looked like it had been designed to be worn backstage at a grateful dead concert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's what real dirndls look like , traditionalists would argue in germany , the dirndl is just one aspect of a broader clothing style known as trachten , which many southern germans wear as their " sunday best . "
while the dress is generally a low-cut and tightly laced affair , it also represents a conservative style .
but in a move that seemed designed to " epater les bourgeouis , " cora schumacher , the fashionable wife of formula one driver and german national hero michael schumacher , wore a dirndl whose fire-engine-red apron had a black skull embroidered on it .
the low-cut black-and-white blouse had a skull-and-bones pattern as well .
locals were shocked , but lady schumi defended her choice .
" i am crazy about them !
i just love skulls plain and simple , " she told spiegel online .
" death is part of life .
and i feel like skulls are totally my good luck charm . "
indeed , cora schumacher is known for wearing skull accessories , including earrings , t-shirts , bags , belts , a leather jacket with a skull made out of rivets by designer thomas wylde , and even a diamond-studded watch with little skulls on it , apparently valued at 50,000 euros . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .

media reports had suggested its products were laced with a chemical that killed four babies . " following press reports in hong kong earlier today claiming that traces of melamine had been found in a nestle growing-up milk , nestle is confident that none of its products in china is made from milk adulterated with melamine , " said the group in a statement .
media reports had claimed that neslac gold 1 + might be affected , but nestle pointed out that the hong kong government 's food safety department had declared the product safe .
nestle cites safety tests the product was tested by the hong kong standards and testing center from sept .
18 to 20 , as well as the food industry research and development in taiwan on sept .
16 , said nestle .
" neither test detected melamine in the product , " the swiss group said , according to afp news service .
it added that it regularly carried out more than 70 different tests on infant formula and other milk products .
so far , four babies have died after drinking milk powder contaminated with melamine , according to government statements .
spreading scandal one of the most serious health scandals involving chinese-made goods , the melamine scare has spread from milk powder to regular milk , yoghurt and ice cream from some of china 's biggest dairy manufacturers .

21 , hong kong 's government said a three-year-old girl developed a kidney stone after drinking tainted chinese milk powder - thought to be the first related sickness outside mainland china .
retailers in the southern chinese territory said they were emptying shelves of all milk powder products from nestle , plastic-bottled dutch lady milk , and canned mr brown coffee .
numbers of victims rise dramatically while nestle said it was " confident " its products in china were safe , the center for food safety , a hong kong government body , said it had found melamine in a nestle dairy farm pure milk sample from north-eastern china .
singapore has also found melamine in a chinese-made milk candy , authorities there said late sunday .
meanwhile , in a dramatic update of previous figures on monday , sept .
22 , the chinese health ministry said a total of 52,857 children were taken to the hospital after drinking milk thought to have been contaminated by the industrial chemical .

product ban in taiwan increasingly , countries were moving to ban or limit chinese dairy imports .
taiwan was the latest to join in , saying it would ban all chinese milk products with immediate notice , regardless of brand , because of consumer concerns .
" there is no time frame for the ban , " said wang chih chao , an official with the department of health .
it said milk products already on the shelves after passing safety tests would not be removed , however .
melamine , normally used in making plastics , was first found in infant milk formula in chinese markets but has since been detected in a range of products with dairy ingredients both in china and abroad .
the discovery is the latest in a series of scandals to tarnish the reputation of chinese products .
it has led to mass recalls and a chinese government campaign to tighten quality inspections across the dairy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four deaths have been reported the scandal stems from the practice of adding melamine to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of higher protein levels .
history of consumer scandals in china up to now a host of countries - bangladesh , brunei , burundi , japan , gabon , malaysia , myanmar , singapore and tanzania - have barred chinese milk products or taken some other form of action to curb consumption .
the melamine scandal first came to light two weeks ago in state-controlled media , but some press reports say the scam had been going on for years .

media reports had suggested its products were laced with a chemical that killed four babies . " following press reports in hong kong earlier today claiming that traces of melamine had been found in a nestle growing-up milk , nestle is confident that none of its products in china is made from milk adulterated with melamine , " said the group in a statement .
media reports had claimed that neslac gold 1 + might be affected , but nestle pointed out that the hong kong government 's food safety department had declared the product safe .
nestle cites safety tests the product was tested by the hong kong standards and testing center from sept .
18 to 20 , as well as the food industry research and development in taiwan on sept .
16 , said nestle .
" neither test detected melamine in the product , " the swiss group said , according to afp news service .
it added that it regularly carried out more than 70 different tests on infant formula and other milk products .
so far , four babies have died after drinking milk powder contaminated with melamine , according to government statements .
spreading scandal one of the most serious health scandals involving chinese-made goods , the melamine scare has spread from milk powder to regular milk , yoghurt and ice cream from some of china 's biggest dairy manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss firm nestle says it is not involved on sunday , sept .
21 , hong kong 's government said a three-year-old girl developed a kidney stone after drinking tainted chinese milk powder - thought to be the first related sickness outside mainland china .
retailers in the southern chinese territory said they were emptying shelves of all milk powder products from nestle , plastic-bottled dutch lady milk , and canned mr brown coffee .
numbers of victims rise dramatically while nestle said it was " confident " its products in china were safe , the center for food safety , a hong kong government body , said it had found melamine in a nestle dairy farm pure milk sample from north-eastern china .
singapore has also found melamine in a chinese-made milk candy , authorities there said late sunday .
meanwhile , in a dramatic update of previous figures on monday , sept .
22 , the chinese health ministry said a total of 52,857 children were taken to the hospital after drinking milk thought to have been contaminated by the industrial chemical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai shelves were cleared of milk products most had " basically recovered " but 12,892 of them remained hospitalized , a health ministry official told afp .
product ban in taiwan increasingly , countries were moving to ban or limit chinese dairy imports .
taiwan was the latest to join in , saying it would ban all chinese milk products with immediate notice , regardless of brand , because of consumer concerns .
" there is no time frame for the ban , " said wang chih chao , an official with the department of health .
it said milk products already on the shelves after passing safety tests would not be removed , however .
melamine , normally used in making plastics , was first found in infant milk formula in chinese markets but has since been detected in a range of products with dairy ingredients both in china and abroad .
the discovery is the latest in a series of scandals to tarnish the reputation of chinese products .
it has led to mass recalls and a chinese government campaign to tighten quality inspections across the dairy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four deaths have been reported the scandal stems from the practice of adding melamine to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of higher protein levels .
history of consumer scandals in china up to now a host of countries - bangladesh , brunei , burundi , japan , gabon , malaysia , myanmar , singapore and tanzania - have barred chinese milk products or taken some other form of action to curb consumption .
the melamine scandal first came to light two weeks ago in state-controlled media , but some press reports say the scam had been going on for years .
china has been hit by a wave of embarrassing scandals in recent years over dangerous products including food , drugs and toys , spoiling its manufacturing reputation .
last year , melamine was found in pet food containing chinese ingredients that killed cats and dogs in the united states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .
syrian nuclear activities under the microscope on monday , el baradei is also set to give board members an interim report on syria , which is suspected of having secretly built a nuclear reactor , possibly with north korean help .
iaea inspectors took samples at the alleged site in june , which was bombed by israeli warplanes last year .
diplomats said last week that results were still outstanding and no final assessment would be possible unless syria gives the iaea access to further sites . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many have argued that china no longer needs german economic aid - particularly at a time when berlin is keeping a close eye on spending in an effort to balance its budget .
germany 's opposition free democrats welcomed the move , saying china had a very strong economy and did not need financial aid or low-interest credits .
" we will in future concentrate on a strategic partnership of the whole government with china , in order to move forward reform processes there in justice , society and climate protection , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul said in an interview with the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
the refocusing of the arrangement would " end classic financial cooperation , " she added .
" we want to encourage dialogue and consultation and the expansion of business partnerships , " zeul said .
germany re-assessing development spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul announced a change to a more advisory role stephan bethe , wieczorek-zeul 's spokesperson , issued a statement which pointed to environmental protection , renewable energy and energy efficiency as possible areas for future advisory cooperation .
he added that he could not yet say on what scale that cooperation would be .
germany has yet to make any development aid pledges for this year or next after pumping 67.5 million -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- into china in 2007 .
china looking for long term cooperation earlier this month , chinese vice premier li keqiang met with minister of finance peer steinbrueck for talks on economic cooperation .
li told steinbrueck that china valued its relations with germany and would promote the relationship from a " strategic , long-term perspective , " adding that china and germany had enjoyed fruitful cooperation since establishing diplomatic ties 36 years ago .
the vice premier said china 's economy had undergone challenges and tests but still showed " stable and rapid development . "
steinbrueck reiterated that germany attached importance to relations with china and would continue to enhance the relationship . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .
syrian nuclear activities under the microscope on monday , el baradei is also set to give board members an interim report on syria , which is suspected of having secretly built a nuclear reactor , possibly with north korean help .
iaea inspectors took samples at the alleged site in june , which was bombed by israeli warplanes last year .
diplomats said last week that results were still outstanding and no final assessment would be possible unless syria gives the iaea access to further sites . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .

while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 22.09.2008 raf victim 's son complains about new baader-meinhof film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the baader-meinhof complex " has been criticized by relatives of raf victims the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered by the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in 1977 , has complained in an interview about the new film about the baader-meinhof group responsible for his father ’ s death . michael buback criticized " the baader-meinhof complex " by producer bernd eichinger in sunday 's die welt , saying that he and other relatives of those killed by the german terrorist organization had not been informed of the contents of the film .
" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .
film aims to end raf terrorist chic there have been plenty of movies about baader , meinhof and the raf but the militants have sometimes been portrayed as cool , leather- jacketed revolutionaries with pistols tucked into their belts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf exhibition was seen as glorifying the group more than 30 years after the events , young people in germany can now flirt with terrorist chic by buying t-shirts with the raf 's trademark machine-gun emblem and there have been exhibitions about baader and meinhof as pop icons .
aust 's book has been thoroughly revised to coincide with the release of the film but many raf terrorists released from jail in recent years have refused to talk to him about what happened .
key documents on the era have also not been released by the german government .
christian klar , 56 , one of the most notorious raf members , is still serving a prison sentence for multiple murders after his recent appeals for clemency were turned down .
his call for mercy while showing no remorse provoked a nationwide emotional debate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 22.09.2008 oktoberfest and the great dirndl debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cora schumacher 's skull-studded dirndl raised quite a few eyebrows at the oktoberfest the number one reason many people go to oktoberfest in munich is , no doubt , the beer .
but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .
first , in an unheard-of move , the wife of bavarian premier guenther beckstein showed up to open the festivities dressed not in a dirndl , but in a - gasp - suit .
so what if the jacket had that loden-green piping that shouts bavaria from 100 paces away ?
so what if the frowsy , middle-aged first lady marga beckstein may have just been trying to avoid a replay of the hulabaloo that followed angela merkel after she showed too much cleavage at the opera ? the wives of german politicians , especially prominent right-wing german politicians , are expected to follow tradition .
and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .
if that was n't enough , traditional german dress took another blow when the wife of another great german leader - this time the premier of formula one racing - showed up in a dirndl that looked like it had been designed to be worn backstage at a grateful dead concert .

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

opposition protest rallies were frequently banned or broken up with force by the police .
alliance spokesman winzuk vetsherko said opposition parties were at a disadvantage in the upcoming polls because candidates " are not elected but named " to sit in parliament .
the opposition planned to field 78 candidates to contest the 100 seats at stake in the legislature , but left a decision on whether to boycott the polls up to the contenders themselves .
lukaschenko denounced the opposition as " unemployed rowdies , " who had no chance of being elected .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .

there was no reason to suspect suicide or foul play , he said . dorflein raised knut by bottle after the cub and his twin brother were rejected by their mother when they were just days old . knut weighed a tiny 810 grams at birth , and there were real fears he would die , as his brother did after just four days . but the bear , who turns two in december , thrived and went on to become the star attraction of the berlin zoo , generating millions of euros in income through merchandizing and admission fees . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.09.2008 opinion : the war on terror ca n't be won by military might alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's thomas baerthlein says political , not military , solutions are what pakistan needs after a suicide bomber killed more than 50 lpeople at an islamabad hotel . the suicide bombing at the marriott hotel in islamabad on saturday , sept .
20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 22.09.2008 raf victim 's son complains about new baader-meinhof film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the baader-meinhof complex " has been criticized by relatives of raf victims the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered by the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in 1977 , has complained in an interview about the new film about the baader-meinhof group responsible for his father ’ s death . michael buback criticized " the baader-meinhof complex " by producer bernd eichinger in sunday 's die welt , saying that he and other relatives of those killed by the german terrorist organization had not been informed of the contents of the film .
" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .
film aims to end raf terrorist chic there have been plenty of movies about baader , meinhof and the raf but the militants have sometimes been portrayed as cool , leather- jacketed revolutionaries with pistols tucked into their belts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf exhibition was seen as glorifying the group more than 30 years after the events , young people in germany can now flirt with terrorist chic by buying t-shirts with the raf 's trademark machine-gun emblem and there have been exhibitions about baader and meinhof as pop icons .
aust 's book has been thoroughly revised to coincide with the release of the film but many raf terrorists released from jail in recent years have refused to talk to him about what happened .
key documents on the era have also not been released by the german government .
christian klar , 56 , one of the most notorious raf members , is still serving a prison sentence for multiple murders after his recent appeals for clemency were turned down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 22.09.2008 raf victim 's son complains about new baader-meinhof film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the baader-meinhof complex " has been criticized by relatives of raf victims the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered by the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in 1977 , has complained in an interview about the new film about the baader-meinhof group responsible for his father ’ s death . michael buback criticized " the baader-meinhof complex " by producer bernd eichinger in sunday 's die welt , saying that he and other relatives of those killed by the german terrorist organization had not been informed of the contents of the film .
" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .
film aims to end raf terrorist chic there have been plenty of movies about baader , meinhof and the raf but the militants have sometimes been portrayed as cool , leather- jacketed revolutionaries with pistols tucked into their belts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf exhibition was seen as glorifying the group more than 30 years after the events , young people in germany can now flirt with terrorist chic by buying t-shirts with the raf 's trademark machine-gun emblem and there have been exhibitions about baader and meinhof as pop icons .
aust 's book has been thoroughly revised to coincide with the release of the film but many raf terrorists released from jail in recent years have refused to talk to him about what happened .
key documents on the era have also not been released by the german government .
christian klar , 56 , one of the most notorious raf members , is still serving a prison sentence for multiple murders after his recent appeals for clemency were turned down .
his call for mercy while showing no remorse provoked a nationwide emotional debate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de journalist stefan aust : baader-meinhof film reflects raf reality journalist and author stefan aust 's book " der baader-meinhof komplex " has been used as the basis for a soon-to-be-released film of the same name .
he told deutsche welle about why the raf still interests people .

events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .
film aims to end raf terrorist chic there have been plenty of movies about baader , meinhof and the raf but the militants have sometimes been portrayed as cool , leather- jacketed revolutionaries with pistols tucked into their belts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf exhibition was seen as glorifying the group more than 30 years after the events , young people in germany can now flirt with terrorist chic by buying t-shirts with the raf 's trademark machine-gun emblem and there have been exhibitions about baader and meinhof as pop icons .
aust 's book has been thoroughly revised to coincide with the release of the film but many raf terrorists released from jail in recent years have refused to talk to him about what happened .
key documents on the era have also not been released by the german government .

" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .

the six group of seven economic powers aside from the united states do not plan any measures comparable to a us package to support the banking sector , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on monday .
ulrich wilhelm , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , too said the government saw no need for such an undertaking in germany .
us reportedly seeking help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulson has called on other countries to create similar resecue plans a foreign ministry spokesman said the us had not approached europeans on the issue so far . the us administration reportedly wants other countries to come up with rescue plans similar to a $ 700 billion -lrb- 480 billion euro -rrb- rescue package announced in washington on sunday .
us treasury secretary henry paulson said on sunday some countries had signaled their readiness to help out , but there had been no firm commitments .
plan aims to head off credit freeze the us rescue plan , which must still be passed by congress , would give the treasury department the power to buy bad mortgage debts from troubled financial institutes to head off a disastrous credit freeze that could bring the international finance system to its knees .
finance minister steinbrueck added that the us plans were very important to stabilizing markets .
there is no reason to fear a credit crunch in germany , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us drew the line at a lehman brothers rescue the us government lurched from one crisis to another last week , standing by as lehman brothers investment bank declared its $ 600 billion bankruptcy and as merrill lynch investment bank was swallowed up by bank of america .
it then stepped in to rescue the insurance giant american international group inc -lrb- aig -rrb- to the tune of $ 85 billion .
markets not only in the us but around the world fluctuated wildly but returned to about where they had been at the beginning of the week after news of the rescue package emerged .
eu welcomes bailout plan the eu commission welcomed the bailout plan when it was announced .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 22.09.2008 germany 's spd warns bank crisis may lead to federal deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been paying out to support banks and the economy since the crisis hit germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have warned that the banking crisis in the us could have an adverse effect on the german economy , leaving the state with revenue deficits in the billions of euros . the spd 's budgetary expert carsten schneider told the passauer neue presse newspaper on monday , sept .
22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

media reports had suggested its products were laced with a chemical that killed four babies . " following press reports in hong kong earlier today claiming that traces of melamine had been found in a nestle growing-up milk , nestle is confident that none of its products in china is made from milk adulterated with melamine , " said the group in a statement .
media reports had claimed that neslac gold 1 + might be affected , but nestle pointed out that the hong kong government 's food safety department had declared the product safe .
nestle cites safety tests the product was tested by the hong kong standards and testing center from sept .
18 to 20 , as well as the food industry research and development in taiwan on sept .
16 , said nestle .
" neither test detected melamine in the product , " the swiss group said , according to afp news service .
it added that it regularly carried out more than 70 different tests on infant formula and other milk products .
so far , four babies have died after drinking milk powder contaminated with melamine , according to government statements .
spreading scandal one of the most serious health scandals involving chinese-made goods , the melamine scare has spread from milk powder to regular milk , yoghurt and ice cream from some of china 's biggest dairy manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss firm nestle says it is not involved on sunday , sept .
21 , hong kong 's government said a three-year-old girl developed a kidney stone after drinking tainted chinese milk powder - thought to be the first related sickness outside mainland china .
retailers in the southern chinese territory said they were emptying shelves of all milk powder products from nestle , plastic-bottled dutch lady milk , and canned mr brown coffee .
numbers of victims rise dramatically while nestle said it was " confident " its products in china were safe , the center for food safety , a hong kong government body , said it had found melamine in a nestle dairy farm pure milk sample from north-eastern china .
singapore has also found melamine in a chinese-made milk candy , authorities there said late sunday .
meanwhile , in a dramatic update of previous figures on monday , sept .
22 , the chinese health ministry said a total of 52,857 children were taken to the hospital after drinking milk thought to have been contaminated by the industrial chemical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai shelves were cleared of milk products most had " basically recovered " but 12,892 of them remained hospitalized , a health ministry official told afp .
product ban in taiwan increasingly , countries were moving to ban or limit chinese dairy imports .
taiwan was the latest to join in , saying it would ban all chinese milk products with immediate notice , regardless of brand , because of consumer concerns .
" there is no time frame for the ban , " said wang chih chao , an official with the department of health .
it said milk products already on the shelves after passing safety tests would not be removed , however .
melamine , normally used in making plastics , was first found in infant milk formula in chinese markets but has since been detected in a range of products with dairy ingredients both in china and abroad .
the discovery is the latest in a series of scandals to tarnish the reputation of chinese products .
it has led to mass recalls and a chinese government campaign to tighten quality inspections across the dairy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four deaths have been reported the scandal stems from the practice of adding melamine to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of higher protein levels .
history of consumer scandals in china up to now a host of countries - bangladesh , brunei , burundi , japan , gabon , malaysia , myanmar , singapore and tanzania - have barred chinese milk products or taken some other form of action to curb consumption .
the melamine scandal first came to light two weeks ago in state-controlled media , but some press reports say the scam had been going on for years .

21 , by saying the government had refused to allow the opposition to sit on regional election commissions , thus depriving them of the chance to monitor the vote .
lukashenko , criticized by human rights groups in his homeland as " europe 's last dictator , " said belarus had strictly adhered to the guidelines laid down by the west in preparing the elections .
on saturday , the president , who has been in power since 1994 , threatened to place relations with the west on ice if it declares the sept .
28 polls undemocratic .
if there is no recognition of the elections " we will stop talking to them , " the president told the news agency interfax .
opposition calls for more freedoms the belarus opposition has complained of the president 's authoritarian style of leadership and lack of press freedom and free speech in the former soviet republic .
opposition protest rallies were frequently banned or broken up with force by the police .
alliance spokesman winzuk vetsherko said opposition parties were at a disadvantage in the upcoming polls because candidates " are not elected but named " to sit in parliament .

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 22.09.2008 raf victim 's son complains about new baader-meinhof film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the baader-meinhof complex " has been criticized by relatives of raf victims the son of chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , murdered by the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in 1977 , has complained in an interview about the new film about the baader-meinhof group responsible for his father ’ s death . michael buback criticized " the baader-meinhof complex " by producer bernd eichinger in sunday 's die welt , saying that he and other relatives of those killed by the german terrorist organization had not been informed of the contents of the film .
" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .
film aims to end raf terrorist chic there have been plenty of movies about baader , meinhof and the raf but the militants have sometimes been portrayed as cool , leather- jacketed revolutionaries with pistols tucked into their belts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf exhibition was seen as glorifying the group more than 30 years after the events , young people in germany can now flirt with terrorist chic by buying t-shirts with the raf 's trademark machine-gun emblem and there have been exhibitions about baader and meinhof as pop icons .
aust 's book has been thoroughly revised to coincide with the release of the film but many raf terrorists released from jail in recent years have refused to talk to him about what happened .
key documents on the era have also not been released by the german government .
christian klar , 56 , one of the most notorious raf members , is still serving a prison sentence for multiple murders after his recent appeals for clemency were turned down .
his call for mercy while showing no remorse provoked a nationwide emotional debate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .

merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .
syrian nuclear activities under the microscope on monday , el baradei is also set to give board members an interim report on syria , which is suspected of having secretly built a nuclear reactor , possibly with north korean help .
iaea inspectors took samples at the alleged site in june , which was bombed by israeli warplanes last year .
diplomats said last week that results were still outstanding and no final assessment would be possible unless syria gives the iaea access to further sites . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

media reports had suggested its products were laced with a chemical that killed four babies . " following press reports in hong kong earlier today claiming that traces of melamine had been found in a nestle growing-up milk , nestle is confident that none of its products in china is made from milk adulterated with melamine , " said the group in a statement .
media reports had claimed that neslac gold 1 + might be affected , but nestle pointed out that the hong kong government 's food safety department had declared the product safe .
nestle cites safety tests the product was tested by the hong kong standards and testing center from sept .
18 to 20 , as well as the food industry research and development in taiwan on sept .
16 , said nestle .
" neither test detected melamine in the product , " the swiss group said , according to afp news service .
it added that it regularly carried out more than 70 different tests on infant formula and other milk products .
so far , four babies have died after drinking milk powder contaminated with melamine , according to government statements .
spreading scandal one of the most serious health scandals involving chinese-made goods , the melamine scare has spread from milk powder to regular milk , yoghurt and ice cream from some of china 's biggest dairy manufacturers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss firm nestle says it is not involved on sunday , sept .
21 , hong kong 's government said a three-year-old girl developed a kidney stone after drinking tainted chinese milk powder - thought to be the first related sickness outside mainland china .
retailers in the southern chinese territory said they were emptying shelves of all milk powder products from nestle , plastic-bottled dutch lady milk , and canned mr brown coffee .
numbers of victims rise dramatically while nestle said it was " confident " its products in china were safe , the center for food safety , a hong kong government body , said it had found melamine in a nestle dairy farm pure milk sample from north-eastern china .
singapore has also found melamine in a chinese-made milk candy , authorities there said late sunday .
meanwhile , in a dramatic update of previous figures on monday , sept .
22 , the chinese health ministry said a total of 52,857 children were taken to the hospital after drinking milk thought to have been contaminated by the industrial chemical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanghai shelves were cleared of milk products most had " basically recovered " but 12,892 of them remained hospitalized , a health ministry official told afp .
product ban in taiwan increasingly , countries were moving to ban or limit chinese dairy imports .
taiwan was the latest to join in , saying it would ban all chinese milk products with immediate notice , regardless of brand , because of consumer concerns .
" there is no time frame for the ban , " said wang chih chao , an official with the department of health .
it said milk products already on the shelves after passing safety tests would not be removed , however .
melamine , normally used in making plastics , was first found in infant milk formula in chinese markets but has since been detected in a range of products with dairy ingredients both in china and abroad .
the discovery is the latest in a series of scandals to tarnish the reputation of chinese products .
it has led to mass recalls and a chinese government campaign to tighten quality inspections across the dairy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four deaths have been reported the scandal stems from the practice of adding melamine to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of higher protein levels .
history of consumer scandals in china up to now a host of countries - bangladesh , brunei , burundi , japan , gabon , malaysia , myanmar , singapore and tanzania - have barred chinese milk products or taken some other form of action to curb consumption .
the melamine scandal first came to light two weeks ago in state-controlled media , but some press reports say the scam had been going on for years .
china has been hit by a wave of embarrassing scandals in recent years over dangerous products including food , drugs and toys , spoiling its manufacturing reputation .
last year , melamine was found in pet food containing chinese ingredients that killed cats and dogs in the united states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .

while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "

a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .
syrian nuclear activities under the microscope on monday , el baradei is also set to give board members an interim report on syria , which is suspected of having secretly built a nuclear reactor , possibly with north korean help .
iaea inspectors took samples at the alleged site in june , which was bombed by israeli warplanes last year .
diplomats said last week that results were still outstanding and no final assessment would be possible unless syria gives the iaea access to further sites . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i did not even know whether there were scenes featuring my father in the film , " buback said .
among the most powerful scenes in the new film are those of a female terrorist plucking a machine-gun from a pram on a cologne street before mowing down buback 's father siegfried and his bodyguards in a hail of bullets .
buback added that some aspects of the film left many unanswered questions , particularly concerning victims of the raf such as his father , industrialist hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief juergen ponto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor buback was gunned down in cologne " did they become victims because of their personality or only because of their jobs ? " he asked .
" my father could be perceived by those who do n't know their history to be a man who just wanted to destroy the baader-meinhof group … and therefore they may see some justification in -lrb- the raf 's -rrb- actions . "
buback conceded , however , that despite this the film was nevertheless worth seeing and that the actors playing the roles of the raf terrorists were excellent .
critics praise film 's authenticity unlike some previous films on the topic , the " the baader-meinhof complex " has been praised by some critics for showing members of the infamous urban guerrilla group founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof as brutal murderers rather than romantic desperadoes .
the film is a fast-paced account of how a band of left-wing revolutionaries caused mayhem in west germany with a series of politically-motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings .
the story begins with violent student protests in berlin in 1967 and ends in the autumn of 1977 when the hijacking of a lufthansa airliner by like-minded palestinians was foiled by elite german forces .
events triggered the suicide of the raf ringleaders in stammheim high-security prison and the murder of hanns-martin schleyer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture the raf released of hanns-martin schleyer director uli edel said he aimed to put the record straight by focusing on the carnage and human toll of the baader-meinhof gang , later the red army faction whose bloody exploits claimed dozens of lives .
" i deliberately put the cameras next to the victims so that we can see what they see , " he told focus magazine .
he said he wanted to " destroy the myth that has grown up around the raf . "
audiences moved by " heartbreaking " feature frank schirrmacher , editor of the respected frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , wrote that he found the film " heartbreaking " to watch and added : " this film has the potential to make people see the raf in an entirely new light . "
a vip screening earlier this month ended with several minutes of stunned silence before the audience applauded .
some critics claimed the terrorists were portrayed as being too glamorous .
the film goes on general release in germany from september 25 .
the makers had upset many reviewers in germany by threatening them with a heavy fine if they released any details about the content of the film before its first showing .
the 150-minute production is billed as one of the most expensive german films to date and producer bernd eichinger and director edel have assembled an impressive cast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has been praised for its gtritty realism it includes moritz bleibtreu as a baby-faced baader and martina gedeck as ulrike meinhof , the prim-looking radical journalist who went underground after abandoning her children in a palestinian refugee camp .
johanna wokalek plays baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin .
swiss actor bruno ganz , who starred as nazi dictator adolf hitler , in the award-winning drama " downfall , " is cast as horst herold , the top policeman who pioneered the use of computers in an unprecedented manhunt for the terrorists .
germany 's film export board has nominated the movie for the february 2009 oscars as best foreign film of the year and german judges said the work " gave a picture of the 1970s without glorifying " the terrorists .
" we have tried to make everything as authentic as possible , " said eichinger who based the film on a best-selling book of the same name by former der spiegel magazine editor stefan aust .

many have argued that china no longer needs german economic aid - particularly at a time when berlin is keeping a close eye on spending in an effort to balance its budget .
germany 's opposition free democrats welcomed the move , saying china had a very strong economy and did not need financial aid or low-interest credits .
" we will in future concentrate on a strategic partnership of the whole government with china , in order to move forward reform processes there in justice , society and climate protection , " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul said in an interview with the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper .
the refocusing of the arrangement would " end classic financial cooperation , " she added .
" we want to encourage dialogue and consultation and the expansion of business partnerships , " zeul said .
germany re-assessing development spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul announced a change to a more advisory role stephan bethe , wieczorek-zeul 's spokesperson , issued a statement which pointed to environmental protection , renewable energy and energy efficiency as possible areas for future advisory cooperation .
he added that he could not yet say on what scale that cooperation would be .
germany has yet to make any development aid pledges for this year or next after pumping 67.5 million -lrb- $ 97.7 million -rrb- into china in 2007 .
china looking for long term cooperation earlier this month , chinese vice premier li keqiang met with minister of finance peer steinbrueck for talks on economic cooperation .
li told steinbrueck that china valued its relations with germany and would promote the relationship from a " strategic , long-term perspective , " adding that china and germany had enjoyed fruitful cooperation since establishing diplomatic ties 36 years ago .
the vice premier said china 's economy had undergone challenges and tests but still showed " stable and rapid development . "
steinbrueck reiterated that germany attached importance to relations with china and would continue to enhance the relationship . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .

and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .
if that was n't enough , traditional german dress took another blow when the wife of another great german leader - this time the premier of formula one racing - showed up in a dirndl that looked like it had been designed to be worn backstage at a grateful dead concert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's what real dirndls look like , traditionalists would argue in germany , the dirndl is just one aspect of a broader clothing style known as trachten , which many southern germans wear as their " sunday best . "
while the dress is generally a low-cut and tightly laced affair , it also represents a conservative style .
but in a move that seemed designed to " epater les bourgeouis , " cora schumacher , the fashionable wife of formula one driver and german national hero michael schumacher , wore a dirndl whose fire-engine-red apron had a black skull embroidered on it .
the low-cut black-and-white blouse had a skull-and-bones pattern as well .
locals were shocked , but lady schumi defended her choice .
" i am crazy about them !

" death is part of life .

but the chance to ogle busty barmaids in low-cut , tightly laced alpine outfits is probably a close second . this year , however , there 's been a bit of a battle over the dirndl .
first , in an unheard-of move , the wife of bavarian premier guenther beckstein showed up to open the festivities dressed not in a dirndl , but in a - gasp - suit .
so what if the jacket had that loden-green piping that shouts bavaria from 100 paces away ?
so what if the frowsy , middle-aged first lady marga beckstein may have just been trying to avoid a replay of the hulabaloo that followed angela merkel after she showed too much cleavage at the opera ? the wives of german politicians , especially prominent right-wing german politicians , are expected to follow tradition .
and tradition calls for opening oktoberfest in a dirndl .
if that was n't enough , traditional german dress took another blow when the wife of another great german leader - this time the premier of formula one racing - showed up in a dirndl that looked like it had been designed to be worn backstage at a grateful dead concert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's what real dirndls look like , traditionalists would argue in germany , the dirndl is just one aspect of a broader clothing style known as trachten , which many southern germans wear as their " sunday best . "
while the dress is generally a low-cut and tightly laced affair , it also represents a conservative style .
but in a move that seemed designed to " epater les bourgeouis , " cora schumacher , the fashionable wife of formula one driver and german national hero michael schumacher , wore a dirndl whose fire-engine-red apron had a black skull embroidered on it .
the low-cut black-and-white blouse had a skull-and-bones pattern as well .
locals were shocked , but lady schumi defended her choice .
" i am crazy about them !
i just love skulls plain and simple , " she told spiegel online .
" death is part of life .
and i feel like skulls are totally my good luck charm . "
indeed , cora schumacher is known for wearing skull accessories , including earrings , t-shirts , bags , belts , a leather jacket with a skull made out of rivets by designer thomas wylde , and even a diamond-studded watch with little skulls on it , apparently valued at 50,000 euros . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

20 , is just the tip of the iceberg .
the extreme precariousness of the security situation in that country becomes even clearer when you look at the tribal areas along the afghanistan border .
for the most part , they are still controlled by the taliban .
it has become a sort of ritual in the " war on terror " to make a pledge of toughness and decisiveness in the wake of these sorts of massive attacks .
but what do these pledges really mean ?
a military solution for the taliban and al-qaeda in north-western pakistan has as much hope of succeeding as the coalition troops that have spent the past seven years in afghanistan : that is to say , not much .
military operations do not provide safety from terrorism .
on the contrary , the rule is that bombing attacks multiply in reaction to military offensives .
us steps up border pressure this pattern applies to current events as well .
in the past week , the us has intensified pressure in the region .
us president george w. bush has apparently authorized troops to advance on pakistani territory from within afghanistan .
but given everything that 's emerging about us operations , it 's been a disaster .
due to a lack of reliable information , the us , like pakistan , frequently carries out imprecise attacks that hit innocent civilians .
serious estimates say hundreds of thousands of people are on the run from the fighting .
if that is n't fertile ground for terrorists , then what is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas baerthlein moreover , the political environment in pakistan completely contradicts a purely military approach .
anti-americanism is deeply rooted in the country and , if anything , seems to be growing .
many - possibly a majority - of pakistanis believe the usa is actually leading a war against the muslim world in the name of an anti-terror campaign .
for many pakistani soldiers , the taliban are not the enemy , but rather , fellow countrymen .
in terror fight , cynicism abounds that the army under ex-president musharraf misused the anti-terror campaign as a way of getting rich ; that hundreds of pakistanis have disappeared without a trace or a trial ; and that the double-crossing army and espionage agencies continue to support the extremists - all that has made folks cynical when it comes to talk of fighting terrorism .
in fact , an alternative political strategy would not be so hard to develop .
the idea is not to give in to the taliban but , first and foremost , to see to it that they are politically isolated .
in pakistan , people are not thronging to the taliban , as elections have shown thus far .
they only flourish where there is a collapse of free government under the law .
but in order to create a wide alliance of democratic and moderate powers against the extremists , it has to be clear that the fight against terror is n't being led by foreign powers , and that that such a fight is being led in accordance with the rule of law .
land of missed opportunity ? the tragedy is that there was already an opportunity to act on such a strategy , when there was a grand coalition government after parliamentary elections .
but the current president , asif ali zardari , spoiled that chance when he declined to reinstate the non-partisan chief justice , and nawaz sharif pulled out of the coalition as a result .
zardari has barely taken office , and already many people are seeing him as a puppet of washington - similar to his predecessor , pervez musharraf , or his afghani counterpart , hamid karzai , who was an honored guest at his swearing-in .
when it comes to the future of the fight against terrorism and extremism , we should all fear the worst .

22 , that estimates put the loss of revenue for the national budget as a whole at " 2 to 3 billion euros " -lrb- $ 2.9 – 4.3 billion -rrb- .
schneider added that germany 's federal states would also feel the pinch because they would be required to contribute more to boost the national budget and support the federal bank .
schneider explained that pressure from the us financial crisis had caused damage to the ikb bank , which needed a 1.2 billion euro rescue package from the state development bank kfw to survive , while the kfw itself has seen more than a billion euros leave its coffers in support of the german economy and various banks since the crisis hit .
kfw is currently also suffering due to the mistaken transfer of 300 million euros to new york investment bank lehman brothers on the same day that lehman declared bankruptcy .
call for more transparency the social democrats also announced on sunday that they were supporting chancellor angela merkel 's reiterated calls for tighter regulation of hedge funds and financial oversight of capital markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and merkel want more transparency merkel rounded on the us and britain at the weekend , saying that her government tried in vain to win g8 support for increased regulation and transparency of global markets last year and that she felt vindicated in her stance as a financial disaster unfolded on wall street in recent days .
merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds .
she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said in a newspaper interview with the muenchner merkur .
steinbrueck reiterated the spd 's support for merkel 's stance in a television interview on sunday night and again called for a worldwide review of financial practices and dialogue on setting up regulatory procedures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iran strongly denies that it ever intended to use nuclear technology for military purposes .
the iaea has been investigating the islamic republic 's contested nuclear drive for five years .
reports that iran made nuclear warheads were " totally baseless " and " not in line with our national interests , " hossein salami , a general in iran 's revolutionary guard , was quoted as saying by iranian news agency irna on sunday .
iaea director general mohamed el baradei wrote in his latest report on iran that his inspectors had not found evidence of actual weapons manufacturing , but that he could not guarantee iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's government was not conducting secret nuclear activities .
several iaea reports have indicated towards an iranian atom bomb effort , including that of a blueprint for a nuclear warhead obtained by tehran , and work on the modification of shahab-3 missiles which points to nuclear use .
powers expected to put on pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us , under president bush , has been the driving force behind un sanctions on iran as iran has neither heeded the call of the united nations security council to answer outstanding questions nor halted its uranium enrichment program , britain , china , france , russia and the united states , as well as germany , were pushed to meet friday in washington to discuss a possible new security council resolution .
while the us , the european union and others are expected to make strong statements at the iaea board meeting condemning iran 's position , a resolution in vienna is unlikely , according to diplomats .
iran is already under three sets of security council sanctions for refusing to freeze uranium enrichment .
ahmadinejad casts europe as anti-islam the world powers can not stop iran 's nuclear progress , iranian state media on monday quoted ahmadinejad as saying upon his arrival in new york to attend the united nations general assembly .
" the talks made by some -lrb- countries -rrb- will be no hurdle in the course of progress of the iranian nation , " the iranian president told state television network irib in new york .
" iran is a powerful country and stands for peace and humanity and has constantly moved within legal boundaries .
iran has been and will be successful in going its way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea boss mohamed elbaradei , left , can not disconfirm secret iranian nuclear plans in the face of the strong anti-nuclear armament feeling - which some would interpret as an anti-iran feeling - set to dominate the iaea meeting , iran has summoned the french ambassador over what tehran labels an increase of anti-islamic sentiment in europe .
a sunday report on iranian state television said an official in iran 's foreign ministry expressed deep concern over anti-islamic sentiment during the meeting with french ambassador bernard poletti .
an " anti-islamification " conference was held over the weekend by a right-wing german nationalist group that opposes the building of a large new mosque in the city of cologne .
syrian nuclear activities under the microscope on monday , el baradei is also set to give board members an interim report on syria , which is suspected of having secretly built a nuclear reactor , possibly with north korean help .
iaea inspectors took samples at the alleged site in june , which was bombed by israeli warplanes last year .
diplomats said last week that results were still outstanding and no final assessment would be possible unless syria gives the iaea access to further sites . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 46 % backing either no further extension of devolution or its reversal , it seems wales is fairly evenly split on the issue .
the assembly government has pledged to hold a referendum on law-making powers , but not taxation , by may 2011 .
a total of 31 % want to keep the current arrangements , 15 % support abolishing the assembly and around 6 % expressed no view .
the survey was carried out by aberystwyth university 's institute of welsh politics in conjunction with pollsters gfknop .
it used a large sample with more than 2,500 telephone interviews conducted in june and early july .
in june 2007 an icm poll for bbc wales showed similar findings , with 47 % supporting a full law-making assembly with tax-raising powers and 44 % against the change .
no campaigning the ground work for a referendum began over the summer , in line with the deal which brought labour and plaid cymru together in the coalition assembly government .
the all wales convention , chaired by sir emyr jones parry , met in july to set about its task of measuring public support for full law-making powers .
this latest survey was completed in the absence of any official campaigning for or against a stronger assembly .
but it appears to indicate that the population of wales is yet to be fully persuaded that devolving further power from london to cardiff is needed .

some 39 % back full law-making and taxation powers , and 10 % independence .
with 46 % backing either no further extension of devolution or its reversal , it seems wales is fairly evenly split on the issue .
the assembly government has pledged to hold a referendum on law-making powers , but not taxation , by may 2011 .
a total of 31 % want to keep the current arrangements , 15 % support abolishing the assembly and around 6 % expressed no view .
the survey was carried out by aberystwyth university 's institute of welsh politics in conjunction with pollsters gfknop .
it used a large sample with more than 2,500 telephone interviews conducted in june and early july .
in june 2007 an icm poll for bbc wales showed similar findings , with 47 % supporting a full law-making assembly with tax-raising powers and 44 % against the change .
no campaigning the ground work for a referendum began over the summer , in line with the deal which brought labour and plaid cymru together in the coalition assembly government .
the all wales convention , chaired by sir emyr jones parry , met in july to set about its task of measuring public support for full law-making powers .
this latest survey was completed in the absence of any official campaigning for or against a stronger assembly .
but it appears to indicate that the population of wales is yet to be fully persuaded that devolving further power from london to cardiff is needed .
welsh assembly poll for full law-making and taxation powers as part of uk : 39 % for independence : 10 % for no change : 31 % want to abolish assembly : 15 % do n't know / refused to comment : 5.5 % source : gfknop / iwp telephone poll june-july ' 08 as things stand , it seems there is not enough evidence yet that the many politicians in the assembly chamber who want a referendum on further powers would get the ' yes ' vote they seek .
if we were in any doubt , the survey also indicates the importance of television and , to a lesser extent , newspapers to any campaigning .
researchers investigated where people found out about welsh politics and current affairs .
some 87 % of those questioned said television news was a source , with between 54 % -lrb- in north wales -rrb- and 68 % -lrb- mid and west wales -rrb- watching bbc wales today three times or more a week .
people 's second most important source of information was friends , family and word of mouth -lrb- 66 % -rrb- .
local newspapers -lrb- 64 % -rrb- and british papers -lrb- 56 % -rrb- came third and fourth in the survey respectively .
amongst the newspapers , the daily mail was top of the stack -lrb- 12.8 % -rrb- followed by the daily mirror -lrb- 9.5 % -rrb- , the sun -lrb- 9.1 % -rrb- , western mail -lrb- 6.3 % -rrb- and south wales echo -lrb- 5 % -rrb- .

rhodri morgan said : " our olympians have done wales proud , and have continued the feel-good factor that has run through welsh sport all year .
" as with the olympics , the welsh contingent has led the team gb gold rush , and together they have raised the profile of the paralympic movement in the eyes of the public .
they fully deserve a heroes ' welcome home . "
mr morgan has recorded a special message for the paralympians which will be played out on a big screen .
he is unable to attend the event in person because he will be returning home from kentucky after taking part in sunday 's handover ceremony for the 2010 wales ryder cup .
jody cundy from swansea racing in the velodrome at beijing instead the celebration will be hosted by heritage minister alun ffred jones , who said : " our paralympic athletes have performed fantastically well in beijing , and i 'm pleased that we 're providing a fitting recognition of how well they have done .
" i hope that the welsh public will come along in their droves to the senedd in cardiff bay to join the school children who will be there to celebrate their achievements .
the party will begin at noon at the senedd with a procession led by a traditional chinese lion television presenter angharad mair will host the event which will also include musical performances by the fitzalan high school steel band and radyr comprehensive , both in cardiff .
hundreds of flag-waving school from schools in brecon , newbridge and risca will also attend .

about 13,000 of the victims remain in hospital , the health ministry added .
four children have died .
chinese prime minister wen jiabao has visited sick children in hospitals and apologised for the food scandal .
most victims are under two years old , and at least 104 of those in hospital are in a serious condition .
the health ministry announced the new figures monday .
it said the sick children had consumed milk powder from the sanlu group , the company where the contamination was first revealed two weeks ago .
local media reports suggested the new number was the result of health officials ' checks of hospital records from may this year to trace the origins of the contamination .

advertisement children are checked in hospital at least 22 other companies have since become involved in the scandal , and milk products made by the yili , mengniu and other groups have been recalled from supermarket shelves .
in hong kong , the two main supermarket chains , wellcome and park 'n'shop , are now recalling products made by nestle , dutch lady and mr brown .
a local newspaper , the chinese language apple daily , had conducted an unofficial test on nestle pure milk and found traces of melamine .
the result was later confirmed by hong kong government tests .
" based on the low level detected , normal consumption will not pose major health effects .
however , it is not advisable for small children to consumer the milk product , " a spokesman for the government 's centre for food safety said .
nestle said in a statement late on sunday that it is " confident " that none of its chinese-made products are made with milk contaminated with melamine .
it said it " has the same stringent quality control system in place in its factories in china as in any other part of the world . "
a three-year old girl in hong kong has been diagnosed with a kidney stone after drinking two glasses of yili high calcium low-fat milk product for more than a year .
her symptoms were described as " mild " .
tests are continuing on other infants in the territory .
in taiwan , shops shelves carrying the mr brown brand of " three-in-one " coffee , in which coffee is mixed with sugar and milk , have been cleared .
in singapore , the chinese-made white rabbit milk sweet has been found to carry traces of melamine and is being recalled , officials there said .
recalls of chinese-made dairy products are now under way in japan , malaysia , and brunei as well .
' trust us ' mr wen said he felt " extremely guilty " about the health scandal .
" i sincerely apologise to all of you , " he said , after visiting sick children in hospital .
" what we are doing now is to ensure that nothing like this will ever happen again , and we are not only talking about milk .
we will never let the same situation repeat with any kind of product .
" we can understand why parents have lost confidence -lrb- in hospitals -rrb- .
after the incident , there was a grave disturbance in my heart .
" please trust us .
we will empty the shelves of any milk product found to have a problem and destroy it so it can not show up anywhere else . "
mr wen also threatened harsh punishments for those found responsible for the contamination .
" public confidence can only be rebuilt on merciless punishment , " he said .
" none of those companies lacking professional ethics or social morals will be let off . "
melamine is used in making plastics and is high in nitrogen , which makes products appear to have a higher protein count .
health experts say that ingesting small amounts does no harm , but sustained use can cause kidney stones and renal failure , especially among the young .

the country 's debt-laiden flag-carrier is currently flying with a provisional licence , according to enac 's president vito riggio .
" if the financial plan does n't arrive in three to four days the licence will be suspended , " he said .
enac is meeting the troubled airline 's special administrator on monday .
flight threat alitalia is estimated to be losing more than 2m euros -lrb- $ 2.9m ; £ 1.6m -rrb- every day , but an attempt to reach a deal with unions and italian consortium cai collapsed last week .
the airline 's special administrator augusto fantozzi is poised to make an appeal for rescue bids .
" we will proceed with a public request -lrb- for offers -rrb- , " mr fantozzi told il messagero over the weekend .
" it will formalise what i have been doing - without any results so far despite all my efforts - regarding the main assets . "
without a rescue , alitalia flights could be grounded within a week to 10 days .
last week , the airline cancelled a number of flights from rome 's fiumicino airport amid rumours it could no longer afford to buy aviation fuel .
union resistance alitalia has been in financial trouble for years .
the possibility of a takeover by italian investor group cai collapsed last week after the offer was opposed by six unions , who were unhappy at plans to cut 3,000 jobs .
three unions had backed the offer .
earlier this year , unions had also blocked air france-klm 's bid to buy alitalia .
under european competition rules nationalisation of the airline is not permitted .
at the weekend , silvio berlusconi said there was little chance of finding a foreign bidder .
" the other big flag carriers are n't interested in getting alitalia out of trouble , " he said in a tv interview .
mr berlusconi said he still hoped that a solution could be found , but conceded that the airline could be " heading towards bankruptcy procedures " .

the annual report from the scottish crime and drugs enforcement agency also showed an increase in the number of arrests for drug offences .
they included 49 people described as being among scotland 's most serious and dangerous criminals .
however , the drug seizures were still lower than the agency 's targets .
the agency said it had recovered £ 15.8m of class a substances such as heroin and cocaine , along with £ 5.1m of cannabis .
the total amount of drugs seized in the previous year was £ 7.5m.
criminal assets worth £ 4,659,840 were also identtified for restraint - an 8 % increase on last year . "
i would like to know to more about the entire serious and organised criminal network within scotland " gordon meldrum scdea scdea director general gordon meldrum told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that the agency had focused much of its attention on the major players at the top of scotland 's drug dealing networks .
he said : " these are people who from our intelligence , and our operations , essentially sit at the top of the criminal tree , those people who maybe orchestrate much of that criminal activity .
" many of those people will not necessarily reside in scotland or visit scotland that often .
a lot of those people will actually reside elsewhere in the uk , across central europe and other in parts of the world . "
earlier this year , a study by the uk drug policy commission raised serious questions about the role high profile drug seizures play in the war on drugs , and argued that their impact on the drug trade was negligible .
justice minister kenny macaskill has said the forthcoming criminal justice bill will include tougher measures against those running criminal gangs , and will help police and the courts tackle the financial basis of criminal empires .
' bring misery ' and mr meldrum accepted the success of the agency should not be measured purely on the amount of drugs it seized .
he added : " i would like to know to more about the entire serious and organised criminal network within scotland and concentrate on maybe the top 10 % or 20 % of that network and judge impact against that as opposed to necessarily the amount of drugs we seize .
" the one thing i would say in terms of drugs raids within this country is if you live in a street or in a close where there is consistent drug dealing night after night , day after day , very often the only respite you get is when police officers come through that door and arrest that drug dealer . "
mr macaskill said : " drugs and the criminals who peddle them continue to bring misery to our communities .
that is why the scottish government set up the serious organised crime taskforce , which meets again today , to work with the scdea , our eight forces and other law enforcement agencies to tackle this menace .
" the scottish crime and drug enforcement agency has had an impressive track record in bringing down these organised gangs and crime networks .
the scdea is to be congratulated on its work over the last year which has seen the removal from our streets of 170 criminals , including 49 of the most dangerous figures and an increase in the amount of class a drugs seized . "

mr macaskill said : " drugs and the criminals who peddle them continue to bring misery to our communities .

unidentified men damaged the churches in bangalore city , police said .
stones were thrown at another place of worship in kodagu , 240km -lrb- 149 miles -rrb- away .
police officials said seven people have been arrested in connection with the bangalore attacks .
in the past week , more than 20 churches have been desecrated by the hindu hardline group bajrang dal .
the group 's leader in the state mahendra kumar has been arrested .
he has admitted his group carried out attacks on churches in the state , saying hindus were being illegally converted to christianity in the area .
christian leaders have denied the charge and said that the state 's governing bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- was inciting violence instead of calming the tense situation in the state .
christians say lower-caste hindus convert willingly to escape the hindu caste system .
advisory the state 's chief minster , bs yeddyurappa , under attack from opposition parties as well as christians for failing to prevent acts of vandalism , has called a high-level security meeting .
the latest attacks have led to calls for the imposition of federal rule in karnataka .
last week , the indian government issued an advisory to the state government to ensure that anti-christian violence was stopped .
christian leaders , led by an mp from bangalore , ht sangliana , have criticised the government for its failure to rein in radical hindu groups who have taken to violence in the name of fighting conversions .
the bjp government has denied the charge and said more than 270 people , including mahendra kumar , have been arrested .
recent anti-christian violence in karnataka - and in the eastern state of orissa - have led to calls for a ban on bajrang dal and another militant hindu organisation , the vishwa hindu parishad -lrb- vhp , world hindu council -rrb- .
orissa has seen anti-christian violence for several weeks now .
at least 20 people - most of them christians - were killed after a hindu religious leader there was shot dead .

they made the announcement late on sunday after the results of parliamentary polls were released .
political parties are banned in the tiny kingdom , one of the world 's last absolute monarchies .
several union officials were detained ahead of friday 's polls as they took part in protests demanding reforms .
some swazis blame king mswati iii - who has been in power since 1986 - for plunging the country into poverty and failing to tackle an aids epidemic .
referendum call police spokesman vusi masuku said a third man from neighbouring south africa , who was also involved in the attempted attack on saturday night , was arrested and will be tried for treason .
the accomplices were trying to plant the bomb on a bridge near the royal household outside the capital , mbabane .
the bbc 's thulani mtwethwa in the landlocked country says the election was the first held under a new constitution .
he said there were a few surprises amongst the unaffiliated candidates chosen : two state radio announcers have become mps and the health minister lost his seat .
it was also the first poll where foreign observers were allowed in .
the southern african development community observers said the poll was " free and fair " .
the mission 's head congratulated the swazi people as they embarked " on their gradual and challenging road for the entrenchment of democracy " .
but mary mugyenyi , head of the pan-african parliament observers , had concerns .
" the mission observed the following challenges : political parties were not permitted to contest in the elections .
" this restriction infringes on the rights of those citizens wishing to participate in elections through political parties and does not meet regional and international standards . "
she recommended that a national referendum be held to ask the swazi people whether they wanted party politics .
correspondents say the king remains popular with many of his subjects , though opposition has been growing to his lavish lifestyle in a country where most people live in poverty .

there was a five-fold surge in the use of custody for 10 to 14-year-olds from 1996-2006 , said the charity .
this is despite no significant increase in serious crime .
barnardo 's is calling for sentencing policy to be overhauled .
the ministry of justice -lrb- moj -rrb- said just three in 100 young people convicted of offences receive custodial sentences .
a spokesman added that custodial sentences for under 14s were a last resort .
preventative work before 1994 , under 15s in england and wales could be sentenced to custody only if they had committed serious or violent offences such as rape , assault or burglary .
but successive legal changes have made it easier for children to be locked up , usually in secure training centres or secure children 's homes , for driving or drunk and disorderly offences , for example .

more from today programme they can also be given custodial sentences for breaching behavioural orders .
barnardo 's said although children aged 10 and 11 can still only be sentenced to custody for " grave crimes " , 12 to 14-year-olds are increasingly being locked up for less serious offences .
the charity said the 550 % rise in the use of custody for children had created an " expensive and ineffective " criminal justice strategy , and had resulted in children " being written off " by the age of 12 .
its study found that if 10 to 14-year-olds were sentenced to custody only for " grave crimes " or violent offences , the number locked up in 2006 would have been cut from 572 to just 104 .
that study , locking up or giving up ? , is based mostly on data from 1996-2006 .
the report said official figures showed only 7 % of the 844 custodial sentences passed on 10 to 14-year-olds last year were for very serious crimes .
the charity says the number of children and young people imprisoned in england and wales is the third highest in europe , behind only the russian federation and the ukraine .
according to the report , holding a child in custody for a year can cost as much as £ 185,780 - the same as six years ' schooling at eton college .
barnardo 's said 80 % of children in custody had been excluded from school and locking them up was ineffective - 78 % of 10 to 14-year-olds will re-offend within 12 months of being released .
unjustifiable custody martin narey , barnardo 's chief executive , and former director general of the prison service , called for a " drastic reduction " in the use of custody for very young children .
it is often the most vulnerable young people in society who end up in the criminal justice system martin narey barnardo 's chief executive " barnardo 's are not naive : we recognise that children committing grave crimes need to be incarcerated , " he said .
" but the explosion in the use of custody for very young children when youth offending has not been growing is inexplicable , unjustifiable and unnecessary .
" it is often the most vulnerable young people in society who end up in the criminal justice system , and despite this only 5 % of the £ 445m spent by the youth justice board -lrb- yjb -rrb- was invested in preventative work . "
barnardo 's wants a change in sentencing thresholds so that a child under 15 can not be sent to custody unless they have committed grave or violent crimes .
it claims this would save the government £ 27.5 million a year .
it also wants local authorities to carry the full costs for those children sentenced to custody .
it says there is currently a strong disincentive for councils to invest in preventative services because the yjb meets the costs of custodial sentences .
mr narey is set to debate the issue with the justice secretary jack straw at the labour conference in manchester .

there was a five-fold surge in the use of custody for 10 to 14-year-olds from 1996-2006 , said the charity .
this is despite no significant increase in serious crime .
barnardo 's is calling for sentencing policy to be overhauled .
the ministry of justice -lrb- moj -rrb- said just three in 100 young people convicted of offences receive custodial sentences .
a spokesman added that custodial sentences for under 14s were a last resort .
preventative work before 1994 , under 15s in england and wales could be sentenced to custody only if they had committed serious or violent offences such as rape , assault or burglary .
but successive legal changes have made it easier for children to be locked up , usually in secure training centres or secure children 's homes , for driving or drunk and disorderly offences , for example .

barnardo 's said although children aged 10 and 11 can still only be sentenced to custody for " grave crimes " , 12 to 14-year-olds are increasingly being locked up for less serious offences .
the charity said the 550 % rise in the use of custody for children had created an " expensive and ineffective " criminal justice strategy , and had resulted in children " being written off " by the age of 12 .
its study found that if 10 to 14-year-olds were sentenced to custody only for " grave crimes " or violent offences , the number locked up in 2006 would have been cut from 572 to just 104 .
that study , locking up or giving up ? , is based mostly on data from 1996-2006 .
the report said official figures showed only 7 % of the 844 custodial sentences passed on 10 to 14-year-olds last year were for very serious crimes .
the charity says the number of children and young people imprisoned in england and wales is the third highest in europe , behind only the russian federation and the ukraine .
according to the report , holding a child in custody for a year can cost as much as £ 185,780 - the same as six years ' schooling at eton college .
barnardo 's said 80 % of children in custody had been excluded from school and locking them up was ineffective - 78 % of 10 to 14-year-olds will re-offend within 12 months of being released .
unjustifiable custody martin narey , barnardo 's chief executive , and former director general of the prison service , called for a " drastic reduction " in the use of custody for very young children .
it is often the most vulnerable young people in society who end up in the criminal justice system martin narey barnardo 's chief executive " barnardo 's are not naive : we recognise that children committing grave crimes need to be incarcerated , " he said .
" but the explosion in the use of custody for very young children when youth offending has not been growing is inexplicable , unjustifiable and unnecessary .
" it is often the most vulnerable young people in society who end up in the criminal justice system , and despite this only 5 % of the £ 445m spent by the youth justice board -lrb- yjb -rrb- was invested in preventative work . "
barnardo 's wants a change in sentencing thresholds so that a child under 15 can not be sent to custody unless they have committed grave or violent crimes .
it claims this would save the government £ 27.5 million a year .
it also wants local authorities to carry the full costs for those children sentenced to custody .
it says there is currently a strong disincentive for councils to invest in preventative services because the yjb meets the costs of custodial sentences .
mr narey is set to debate the issue with the justice secretary jack straw at the labour conference in manchester .

the charity said the 550 % rise in the use of custody for children had created an " expensive and ineffective " criminal justice strategy , and had resulted in children " being written off " by the age of 12 .
its study found that if 10 to 14-year-olds were sentenced to custody only for " grave crimes " or violent offences , the number locked up in 2006 would have been cut from 572 to just 104 .
that study , locking up or giving up ? , is based mostly on data from 1996-2006 .
the report said official figures showed only 7 % of the 844 custodial sentences passed on 10 to 14-year-olds last year were for very serious crimes .
the charity says the number of children and young people imprisoned in england and wales is the third highest in europe , behind only the russian federation and the ukraine .
according to the report , holding a child in custody for a year can cost as much as £ 185,780 - the same as six years ' schooling at eton college .
barnardo 's said 80 % of children in custody had been excluded from school and locking them up was ineffective - 78 % of 10 to 14-year-olds will re-offend within 12 months of being released .
unjustifiable custody martin narey , barnardo 's chief executive , and former director general of the prison service , called for a " drastic reduction " in the use of custody for very young children .
it is often the most vulnerable young people in society who end up in the criminal justice system martin narey barnardo 's chief executive " barnardo 's are not naive : we recognise that children committing grave crimes need to be incarcerated , " he said .
" but the explosion in the use of custody for very young children when youth offending has not been growing is inexplicable , unjustifiable and unnecessary .
" it is often the most vulnerable young people in society who end up in the criminal justice system , and despite this only 5 % of the £ 445m spent by the youth justice board -lrb- yjb -rrb- was invested in preventative work . "
barnardo 's wants a change in sentencing thresholds so that a child under 15 can not be sent to custody unless they have committed grave or violent crimes .
it claims this would save the government £ 27.5 million a year .
it also wants local authorities to carry the full costs for those children sentenced to custody .
it says there is currently a strong disincentive for councils to invest in preventative services because the yjb meets the costs of custodial sentences .
mr narey is set to debate the issue with the justice secretary jack straw at the labour conference in manchester .

owners will be taught how to walk their dogs properly , follow basic commands and learn about dog diet and exercise .

the move is seen as a rebuff to the united states , which is facing increasingly fraught relationships with the two nations .
russian navy spokesman igor dygalo said the ships set sail at 1000 local time -lrb- 0600 gmt -rrb- , and would travel 15,000 nautical miles to reach their destination .
" it 's the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser peter the great , the anti-submarine warship admiral chebanenko and other accompanying ships , " he told the afp news agency .
two russian bombers arrived in venezuela last week for training flights .

russian deputy prime minister igor sechin , in caracas last week , said five russian oil firms were looking to begin operations in venezuela .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who will visit moscow this week , said on sunday that latin america needed a strong friendship with russia to help reduce washington 's influence in the region .
a staunch critic of the us , he backed russian intervention in georgia last month and has accused washington of being scared of moscow 's " new world potential " .
mr sechin also warned the us not to view latin america as its own backyard .
" it would be wrong to talk about one nation having exclusive rights to this zone , " he told the associated press .
during the cold war , latin america became an ideological battleground between the us and the then ussr .

indeed , if the topic was not so serious , it could almost be the subject for one of the more bizarre monty python comedy sketches .
senior figures across iran have been lining up as if for a contest - to prove quite how strongly opposed they are to israel and zionism .
in official circles in the islamic republic of iran , it is , of course , accepted beyond dispute that zionism is evil , possibly even the source of all evil in the world . "
today , iran is friends with the american and israeli people .
no nation in the world is our enemy " esfandiar rahim mashae tourism minister president mahmoud ahmadinejad has been particularly outspoken in his comments on the matter .
his remark that israel should be " wiped off the face of the map " was one of the first signs that his was going to be a most controversial presidency - even if the precise translation of those comments is still disputed .
so the most bizarre element in this episode is that it is a close ally of the president who has been accused of being too friendly to the jewish state , or at least to its citizens .
in an interview in july , the vice president in charge of tourism , esfandiar rahim mashaei , was quoted as saying that iranians were friends with the israeli people , despite the conflict between their governments .
" today , iran is friends with the american and israeli people , " he said , according to the semi-official fars news agency .
" no nation in the world is our enemy . "
ahmadinejad 's backing it sounded just like the standard cliche from the us state department : " we are not enemies with the people of country x , just their leaders . "
but in iran , in the present climate , even the slightest hint that everything about israel is not pure evil unleashed a storm of protest , with sermons , newspaper editorials , complaints in parliament and demonstrations .
yet the vice president refused to back down .
the controversy dominated a news conference given last thursday by president ahmadinejad - provoking numerous questions , and taking up more than half-an-hour of the proceedings .
the president supported his deputy 's comments , while making one of his strongest tirades to date against the ' leaders of zionism ' .
mr ahmadinejad said that a handful - only around 2000 zionists - dominated the centres of power in the west .
they were atheists , he said , who wanted to dominate the world and plunder the wealth of nations .
and mr ahmadinejad argued that that many of those now living in israel had been duped into moving to the country by that handful of zionists .
it was time to open the gates to let them return home .
he had sympathy for them , he explained , just as he had compassion even for us president george w bush , who could have been a better person , despite his countless crimes .
ayatollah 's attack but despite the tough rhetoric against israel , there was a quick rebuke from the supreme leader , ayatollah khamenei .
speaking at last friday 's prayers , the ayatollah made it clear he had no sympathy for the israeli people .
" who are the israelis , " he said .
" they are responsible for usurping houses , territory , farmlands and businesses .
they are fighters at the disposal of zionist operatives .
" a muslim nation can not remain indifferent to such people who are stooges at the service of the arch-enemies of the muslim world , " the ayatollah said .
mr mashaei immediately declared his loyalty to the supreme leader , but still did not retract his comments .
and there is plenty of evidence that the vice president spoke with the approval , perhaps even the encouragement , of president ahmadinejad .
the two men have been close friends since they served together in the revolutionary guards .
they are even related - mr mashaei 's daughter is married to mr ahmadinejad 's son - one of many dynastic marriages in iran .
peace overture ?
journalist ali pahlavan says it is quite possible that mr mashaei is being used as a mouthpiece for the president , enabling mr ahmadinejad to qualify his controversial comments about wiping israel off the map .
" he is trying to enhance and enlighten and broaden the idea of a world without israel , " mr pahlavan explained .
to show , in other words , that iran 's intention is not to wipe out the israeli people in some new act of genocide , but just to see the end of the state of israel , just as the soviet union disintegrated .
there has even been speculation that this might be the prelude to a peace overture from president ahmadinejad to the united states .
it is an intriguing idea , just as mr ahmadinejad arrives in new york for his annual visit to the un general assembly .
what better opportunity for some ground-breaking diplomacy ?
certainly , mr ahmadinejad is a believer that iran 's best policy lies in negotiating directly with the " great satan " - by contrast with others in the country , who believe their best hope is in using europe as an intermediary .
but if this is a peace initiative , it is deeply misguided - even by the strange standards of mr ahmadinejad 's government .
to accuse your negotiating partner of being in the hands of a few evil atheist zionists is hardly the best way to encourage constructive talks .
and there is absolutely also no sign that tehran is willing to compromise on the more substantive issue on their agenda - iran 's nuclear programme .
more likely , this seems to be an internal argument within iranian ruling circles , a sort of theological refinement of exactly where the limits lie to the anti-zionism that the country uses to help define its very raison d 'etre .

indeed , if the topic was not so serious , it could almost be the subject for one of the more bizarre monty python comedy sketches .
senior figures across iran have been lining up as if for a contest - to prove quite how strongly opposed they are to israel and zionism .
in official circles in the islamic republic of iran , it is , of course , accepted beyond dispute that zionism is evil , possibly even the source of all evil in the world .
today , iran is friends with the american and israeli people .
no nation in the world is our enemy esfandiar rahim mashae tourism minister president mahmoud ahmadinejad has been particularly outspoken in his comments on the matter .
his remark that israel should be " wiped off the face of the map " was one of the first signs that his was going to be a most controversial presidency - even if the precise translation of those comments is still disputed .
so the most bizarre element in this episode is that it is a close ally of the president who has been accused of being too friendly to the jewish state , or at least to its citizens .
in an interview in july , the vice president in charge of tourism , esfandiar rahim mashaei , was quoted as saying that iranians were friends with the israeli people , despite the conflict between their governments .
" today , iran is friends with the american and israeli people , " he said , according to the semi-official fars news agency .
" no nation in the world is our enemy . "
ahmadinejad 's backing it sounded just like the standard cliche from the us state department : " we are not enemies with the people of country x , just their leaders . "
ayatollah khamenei made it clear he had no sympathy for the israelis but in iran , in the present climate , even the slightest hint that everything about israel is not pure evil unleashed a storm of protest , with sermons , newspaper editorials , complaints in parliament and demonstrations .
yet the vice president refused to back down .
the controversy dominated a news conference given last thursday by president ahmadinejad - provoking numerous questions , and taking up more than half-an-hour of the proceedings .
the president supported his deputy 's comments , while making one of his strongest tirades to date against the ' leaders of zionism ' .
mr ahmadinejad said that a handful - only around 2000 zionists - dominated the centres of power in the west .
they were atheists , he said , who wanted to dominate the world and plunder the wealth of nations .
and mr ahmadinejad argued that that many of those now living in israel had been duped into moving to the country by that handful of zionists .
it was time to open the gates to let them return home .
he had sympathy for them , he explained , just as he had compassion even for us president george w bush , who could have been a better person , despite his countless crimes .
ayatollah 's attack but despite the tough rhetoric against israel , there was a quick rebuke from the supreme leader , ayatollah khamenei .
speaking at last friday 's prayers , the ayatollah made it clear he had no sympathy for the israeli people .
" who are the israelis , " he said .
" they are responsible for usurping houses , territory , farmlands and businesses .
they are fighters at the disposal of zionist operatives .
" a muslim nation can not remain indifferent to such people who are stooges at the service of the arch-enemies of the muslim world , " the ayatollah said .
mr mashaei immediately declared his loyalty to the supreme leader , but still did not retract his comments .
and there is plenty of evidence that the vice president spoke with the approval , perhaps even the encouragement , of president ahmadinejad .
the two men have been close friends since they served together in the revolutionary guards .
they are even related - mr mashaei 's daughter is married to mr ahmadinejad 's son - one of many dynastic marriages in iran .

so the most bizarre element in this episode is that it is a close ally of the president who has been accused of being too friendly to the jewish state , or at least to its citizens .
in an interview in july , the vice president in charge of tourism , esfandiar rahim mashaei , was quoted as saying that iranians were friends with the israeli people , despite the conflict between their governments .
" today , iran is friends with the american and israeli people , " he said , according to the semi-official fars news agency .
" no nation in the world is our enemy . "
ahmadinejad 's backing it sounded just like the standard cliche from the us state department : " we are not enemies with the people of country x , just their leaders . "
ayatollah khamenei made it clear he had no sympathy for the israelis but in iran , in the present climate , even the slightest hint that everything about israel is not pure evil unleashed a storm of protest , with sermons , newspaper editorials , complaints in parliament and demonstrations .
yet the vice president refused to back down .
the controversy dominated a news conference given last thursday by president ahmadinejad - provoking numerous questions , and taking up more than half-an-hour of the proceedings .
the president supported his deputy 's comments , while making one of his strongest tirades to date against the ' leaders of zionism ' .
mr ahmadinejad said that a handful - only around 2000 zionists - dominated the centres of power in the west .
they were atheists , he said , who wanted to dominate the world and plunder the wealth of nations .
and mr ahmadinejad argued that that many of those now living in israel had been duped into moving to the country by that handful of zionists .
it was time to open the gates to let them return home .
he had sympathy for them , he explained , just as he had compassion even for us president george w bush , who could have been a better person , despite his countless crimes .
ayatollah 's attack but despite the tough rhetoric against israel , there was a quick rebuke from the supreme leader , ayatollah khamenei .
speaking at last friday 's prayers , the ayatollah made it clear he had no sympathy for the israeli people .
" who are the israelis , " he said .
" they are responsible for usurping houses , territory , farmlands and businesses .
they are fighters at the disposal of zionist operatives .
" a muslim nation can not remain indifferent to such people who are stooges at the service of the arch-enemies of the muslim world , " the ayatollah said .
mr mashaei immediately declared his loyalty to the supreme leader , but still did not retract his comments .
and there is plenty of evidence that the vice president spoke with the approval , perhaps even the encouragement , of president ahmadinejad .
the two men have been close friends since they served together in the revolutionary guards .
they are even related - mr mashaei 's daughter is married to mr ahmadinejad 's son - one of many dynastic marriages in iran .
peace overture ?
journalist ali pahlavan says it is quite possible that mr mashaei is being used as a mouthpiece for the president , enabling mr ahmadinejad to qualify his controversial comments about wiping israel off the map .
iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes " he is trying to enhance and enlighten and broaden the idea of a world without israel , " mr pahlavan explained .
to show , in other words , that iran 's intention is not to wipe out the israeli people in some new act of genocide , but just to see the end of the state of israel , just as the soviet union disintegrated .
there has even been speculation that this might be the prelude to a peace overture from president ahmadinejad to the united states .
it is an intriguing idea , just as mr ahmadinejad arrives in new york for his annual visit to the un general assembly .
what better opportunity for some ground-breaking diplomacy ?
certainly , mr ahmadinejad is a believer that iran 's best policy lies in negotiating directly with the " great satan " - by contrast with others in the country , who believe their best hope is in using europe as an intermediary .
but if this is a peace initiative , it is deeply misguided - even by the strange standards of mr ahmadinejad 's government .
to accuse your negotiating partner of being in the hands of a few evil atheist zionists is hardly the best way to encourage constructive talks .
and there is absolutely also no sign that tehran is willing to compromise on the more substantive issue on their agenda - iran 's nuclear programme .
more likely , this seems to be an internal argument within iranian ruling circles , a sort of theological refinement of exactly where the limits lie to the anti-zionism that the country uses to help define its very raison d 'etre .

gervais says he is more concerned with writing than acting the picture in which gervais stars - called ghost town - was released in the us this weekend .
but despite good reviews , the film itself has n't generated a lot of heat at the box office .
gervais appears opposite greg kinnear and tea leoni as a new york dentist who finds himself unwillingly involved in a supernatural love triangle .
one of america 's top film critics , roger ebert , wrote : " gervais has at last found a leading role in a feature , and it 's a good one . "
the new york newspaper , newsday , said gervais was " among the funniest men in film " .
but there were one or two dissenters .
time out new york made the observation that " the film 's idea of humour is to have gervais wear his dentist uniform outside the office " .
' terrific actor ' on initial estimates , ghost town came in at only eighth place in the list of top 10 films at the us weekend box office .
gervais appeared on stage at sunday night 's emmys but paul dergarabedian , from the tracking company media by numbers , said it had been a very competitive season for comedies .
he stressed that ghost town had shown that " as a leading man , ricky gervais proves he is a terrific actor " .
at first sight , playing a romantic lead seems quite a stretch for gervais given his track record with the office and extras .
but he is quick to explain that he 's not doing the stereotypical hollywood leading man .
" it 's not a brad pitt role , " he says .
" i 'm still playing a putz who says stupid things .
" if it was die hard or the matrix i would n't know where to start and i would n't sleep at night thinking i 'm going to make a fool of myself , but with this i know what i 'm doing . "
gervais - who spoke onstage at sunday night 's emmy awards - maintains that having an onscreen hollywood profile is not a top priority .
who wants to see my fat face all over the screen ?
i 'm a better writer and director than i am a leading man ricky gervais he says : " i 'm much more interested in developing the writing and directing career - that 's always excited me more .
" if i do the odd role or the odd lead then so be it but that 's not what i 'm trying to develop .
" who wants to see my fat face all over the screen ?
i 'm a better writer and director than i am a leading man and i know you know that . "
fantasy comedy even if he is n't seeking hollywood stardom , gervais has another film in the pipeline packed with star power called this side of the truth .
he 's not necessarily a household name here yet in the us but i think he will be paul dergarabedian media by numbers gervais co-wrote and directed the fantasy comedy and he stars with an illustrious cast that includes jennifer garner , rob lowe and patrick stewart .
although gervais has a strong and loyal following in america , he is n't that well known outside the big cities .
mr dergarabedian believes that , as a result of ghost town , that may now change .
" he 's not necessarily a household name here yet in the us but i think he will be , " he added .
at the very least ghost town , which was seen in some 1,500 american cinemas over the weekend , is going to help ricky gervais boost his profile and , with its strong reviews , probably increase his currency in hollywood .

gervais says he is more concerned with writing than acting the picture in which gervais stars - called ghost town - was released in the us this weekend .
but despite good reviews , the film itself has n't generated a lot of heat at the box office .
gervais appears opposite greg kinnear and tea leoni as a new york dentist who finds himself unwillingly involved in a supernatural love triangle .
one of america 's top film critics , roger ebert , wrote : " gervais has at last found a leading role in a feature , and it 's a good one . "
the new york newspaper , newsday , said gervais was " among the funniest men in film " .
but there were one or two dissenters .
time out new york made the observation that " the film 's idea of humour is to have gervais wear his dentist uniform outside the office " .
' terrific actor ' on initial estimates , ghost town came in at only eighth place in the list of top 10 films at the us weekend box office .
gervais appeared on stage at sunday night 's emmys but paul dergarabedian , from the tracking company media by numbers , said it had been a very competitive season for comedies .
he stressed that ghost town had shown that " as a leading man , ricky gervais proves he is a terrific actor " .
at first sight , playing a romantic lead seems quite a stretch for gervais given his track record with the office and extras .
but he is quick to explain that he 's not doing the stereotypical hollywood leading man .
" it 's not a brad pitt role , " he says .
" i 'm still playing a putz who says stupid things .
" if it was die hard or the matrix i would n't know where to start and i would n't sleep at night thinking i 'm going to make a fool of myself , but with this i know what i 'm doing . "
gervais - who spoke onstage at sunday night 's emmy awards - maintains that having an onscreen hollywood profile is not a top priority .
who wants to see my fat face all over the screen ?
i 'm a better writer and director than i am a leading man ricky gervais he says : " i 'm much more interested in developing the writing and directing career - that 's always excited me more .
" if i do the odd role or the odd lead then so be it but that 's not what i 'm trying to develop .
" who wants to see my fat face all over the screen ?
i 'm a better writer and director than i am a leading man and i know you know that . "
fantasy comedy even if he is n't seeking hollywood stardom , gervais has another film in the pipeline packed with star power called this side of the truth .
he 's not necessarily a household name here yet in the us but i think he will be paul dergarabedian media by numbers gervais co-wrote and directed the fantasy comedy and he stars with an illustrious cast that includes jennifer garner , rob lowe and patrick stewart .
although gervais has a strong and loyal following in america , he is n't that well known outside the big cities .
mr dergarabedian believes that , as a result of ghost town , that may now change .
" he 's not necessarily a household name here yet in the us but i think he will be , " he added .
at the very least ghost town , which was seen in some 1,500 american cinemas over the weekend , is going to help ricky gervais boost his profile and , with its strong reviews , probably increase his currency in hollywood .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- ghost town boosts gervais profile bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture 10:15 gmt , monday , 22 september 2008 11:15 uk ghost town boosts gervais profile by tom brook entertainment reporter , bbc news ricky gervais has won strong reviews in the us for his first role as a leading man in a hollywood film .
the picture in which gervais stars - called ghost town - was released in the us this weekend .
but despite good reviews , the film itself has n't generated a lot of heat at the box office .
gervais appears opposite greg kinnear and tea leoni as a new york dentist who finds himself unwillingly involved in a supernatural love triangle .
one of america 's top film critics , roger ebert , wrote : " gervais has at last found a leading role in a feature , and it 's a good one . "
the new york newspaper , newsday , said gervais was " among the funniest men in film " .
but there were one or two dissenters .
time out new york made the observation that " the film 's idea of humour is to have gervais wear his dentist uniform outside the office " .
' terrific actor ' on initial estimates , ghost town came in at only eighth place in the list of top 10 films at the us weekend box office .
but paul dergarabedian , from the tracking company media by numbers , said it had been a very competitive season for comedies .
he stressed that ghost town had shown that " as a leading man , ricky gervais proves he is a terrific actor " .
at first sight , playing a romantic lead seems quite a stretch for gervais given his track record with the office and extras .
but he is quick to explain that he 's not doing the stereotypical hollywood leading man .
" it 's not a brad pitt role , " he says .
" i 'm still playing a putz who says stupid things .
" if it was die hard or the matrix i would n't know where to start and i would n't sleep at night thinking i 'm going to make a fool of myself , but with this i know what i 'm doing . "
gervais - who spoke onstage at sunday night 's emmy awards - maintains that having an onscreen hollywood profile is not a top priority . "
who wants to see my fat face all over the screen ?
i 'm a better writer and director than i am a leading man " ricky gervais he says : " i 'm much more interested in developing the writing and directing career - that 's always excited me more .
" if i do the odd role or the odd lead then so be it but that 's not what i 'm trying to develop .
" who wants to see my fat face all over the screen ?
i 'm a better writer and director than i am a leading man and i know you know that . "
fantasy comedy even if he is n't seeking hollywood stardom , gervais has another film in the pipeline packed with star power called this side of the truth . "
he 's not necessarily a household name here yet in the us but i think he will be " paul dergarabedian media by numbers gervais co-wrote and directed the fantasy comedy and he stars with an illustrious cast that includes jennifer garner , rob lowe and patrick stewart .
although gervais has a strong and loyal following in america , he is n't that well known outside the big cities .
mr dergarabedian believes that , as a result of ghost town , that may now change .
" he 's not necessarily a household name here yet in the us but i think he will be , " he added .
at the very least ghost town , which was seen in some 1,500 american cinemas over the weekend , is going to help ricky gervais boost his profile and , with its strong reviews , probably increase his currency in hollywood .

alesha dixon on returning to strictly come dancing for a guest appearance strictly come dancing champion alesha dixon says she feels " blessed " to be releasing a solo album after previously being dropped by her record label .
the 29-year-old , who was in girl group mis-teeq , was dropped as a solo artist by polydor in 2006 before being offered a new contract after winning the show .
she told the bbc news website it was " great to have the opportunity to make another album " .
her new album , the alesha show , is out on 17 november through asylum records .
it will be preceded by single , the boy does nothing , on 10 november .
' same enthusiasm ' the singer , who returned to strictly come dancing at the weekend for a guest appearance , said : " in 2006 , i lost a record deal and at the time , obviously , it was scary and was horrible but i think that , in retrospect , these things are meant to happen .
" if i was n't dropped by polydor , i would n't have had the opportunity to do strictly come dancing . "
for me , being in the industry for such a long time , it almost feels like i 'm starting again alesha dixon some 11.4 million viewers watched dixon and dance partner matthew cutler win the final of the show in december by beating ex-eastenders star matt di angelo and partner flavia cacace .
the new single was co-written with producers xenomania , who she has collaborated with for a number of tracks on the album , which she describes as " a very personal record " .
she has also worked with producers including redzone , who worked on rihanna hit umbrella , and stephen lipson , who has worked with stars including grace jones and annie lennox .
" for me , being in the industry for such a long time , it almost feels like i 'm starting again but with more knowledge and with the same amount of enthusiasm - if not more - to succeed , " she added .
" i just feel blessed to be put into this opportunity again . "

attracting money to build new coal and nuclear plants was vital , the business secretary said , as he attacked the tories for " posturing " on the issue .
more than 80 labour mps and union leaders have called for a windfall tax on the profits of leading energy firms .
but mr hutton has argued this could hit vital investment in new power plants .
' energy leadership ' mr hutton said the uk was facing a " tough fight " to secure the billions needed to meet the country 's energy needs and had to ensure the " right climate " for investment .
more broadly , he urged the government to be decisive in its response to the " monumental upheaval " in the global financial system .
" our ambition must be more than weathering the economic storm , " he said .
" we should make changes now so britain emerges is stronger and fitter for the future . "
" the battle for energy security is going to define the fight for britain 's future " john hutton , business secretary on energy issues , he acknowledged the uk 's gas supplies were dwindling and the country had to prepare itself for a potential scenario in which it had to import 80 % of its gas from overseas , much of it from potentially " unstable " regions .
" the battle for energy security is going to define the fight for britain 's future , " he argued .
given these threats , mr hutton said the uk could not afford to turn its back on any potential source of energy , including renewable , coal and nuclear .
" no coal and no nuclear equals no lights , no power , no future , " he said .
the conservatives were guilty of sending " mixed messages " on their support for a new generation of nuclear power stations , he said .
this contrasted with labour 's " leadership " and willingness to confront the " long-term challenges " facing the country .
on employment issues , mr hutton said labour could be " proud " of its record of boosting workers ' rights in government .
ministers would continue to " strike a balance " between extending workplace rights and ensuring business conditions remained competitive , he added .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : what exactly is short selling ?
bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies 10:34 gmt , monday , 22 september 2008 11:34 uk q & a : what exactly is short selling ?
the investment practice of short selling has been banned in the uk , for 29 specific financial shares , until 16 january 2009 .
it has been held partly responsible for undermining confidence in the uk 's biggest mortgage lender hbos .
the decision of the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- was an attempt to clamp down on some of the extraordinary recent falls in the value of shares in the banking industry .
the experience of hbos ended with that bank being taken over by lloyds tsb , but the fsa and the government are clearly worried there may be more examples to come .
so what is short selling ?
it is a technique that sees investors borrow an asset , such as shares , currencies or oil contracts , from another investor and then sell that asset in the relevant market hoping the price will fall .
the aim is to buy back the asset at a lower price and return it to its owner , pocketing the difference .
the same effect can be achieved without even borrowing the shares at all , but simply by using derivatives contracts - glorified bets .
this practice may have been to blame for the slump in the shares of hbos after it announced plans to raise £ 4bn through a rights issue back in april , and contributed to further huge falls in its shares in the three days before its takeover was announced .
why does short selling reduce share prices ?
if lots of traders are short selling a particular share then the first thing they will have to do is borrow the shares .
once they have done that they will sell them .
what it will mean is that at the current price , more people are trying to sell the share than are trying to buy it and that will push down the share price .
compare it with a situation on a particular street on which two homes are for sale .
if five more identical houses on the street are suddenly put on the market then it is likely that prices will have to be cut if they are all going to be sold .
the other effect happens because some institutions are known to be specialist short-sellers .
if everyone sees that one of those institutions has sold a load of shares in a particular company , then there is a danger that there will be panic in the market as other shareholders worry that the price could plunge .
who can short shares ?
anyone can short a position in a company 's shares , but typically hedge funds are the main players .
many of the main investors in hedge funds are pension and insurance funds .
for any party who is going short , there needs to be another party who wants to bet that the shares or commodities will not fall as far as the short seller believes .
why has it been getting a bad press lately ?
short sellers have been accused of targeting the shares of hbos and other banks at a time when there were doubts about their ability to raise long-term finance as financial markets have been seizing up .
are short sellers solely to blame for the slump in hbos shares ?
many analysts say no .
in order for shares to be shorted they first need to be borrowed , and there are figures available showing how many are on loan at any given time .
on tuesday 16 september , when hbos shares were plunging , only 2.75 % of its shares were out on loan , according to research firm data explorers .
that compares with july - the month shares began trading under its rights issue - when 18 % of the shares were out on loan .
many hedge funds argue that short sellers are often pointing out an uncomfortable truth about the financial position of the companies whose shares they are selling - that they are not as valuable as people think they are .
as such , it is argued , they are often doing everyone a favour by exposing the real value of a company 's shares .
the financial equivalent of the boy who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : what exactly is short selling ?
british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 10:34 gmt , monday , 22 september 2008 11:34 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : what exactly is short selling ?
the investment practice of short selling has been banned in the uk , for 29 specific financial shares , until 16 january 2009 .
the fall in the hbos share price may have been partly a result of short-selling it has been held partly responsible for undermining confidence in the uk 's biggest mortgage lender hbos .
the decision of the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- was an attempt to clamp down on some of the extraordinary recent falls in the value of shares in the banking industry .
the experience of hbos ended with that bank being taken over by lloyds tsb , but the fsa and the government are clearly worried there may be more examples to come .
so what is short selling ?
it is a technique that sees investors borrow an asset , such as shares , currencies or oil contracts , from another investor and then sell that asset in the relevant market hoping the price will fall .
the aim is to buy back the asset at a lower price and return it to its owner , pocketing the difference .
the same effect can be achieved without even borrowing the shares at all , but simply by using derivatives contracts - glorified bets .
this practice may have been to blame for the slump in the shares of hbos after it announced plans to raise £ 4bn through a rights issue back in april , and contributed to further huge falls in its shares in the three days before its takeover was announced .
why does short selling reduce share prices ?
if lots of traders are short selling a particular share then the first thing they will have to do is borrow the shares .
once they have done that they will sell them .
what it will mean is that at the current price , more people are trying to sell the share than are trying to buy it and that will push down the share price .
compare it with a situation on a particular street on which two homes are for sale .
if five more identical houses on the street are suddenly put on the market then it is likely that prices will have to be cut if they are all going to be sold .
the other effect happens because some institutions are known to be specialist short-sellers .
if everyone sees that one of those institutions has sold a load of shares in a particular company , then there is a danger that there will be panic in the market as other shareholders worry that the price could plunge .
who can short shares ?
anyone can short a position in a company 's shares , but typically hedge funds are the main players .
many of the main investors in hedge funds are pension and insurance funds .
for any party who is going short , there needs to be another party who wants to bet that the shares or commodities will not fall as far as the short seller believes .
why has it been getting a bad press lately ?
short sellers have been accused of targeting the shares of hbos and other banks at a time when there were doubts about their ability to raise long-term finance as financial markets have been seizing up .
are short sellers solely to blame for the slump in hbos shares ?
many analysts say no .
in order for shares to be shorted they first need to be borrowed , and there are figures available showing how many are on loan at any given time .
on tuesday 16 september , when hbos shares were plunging , only 2.75 % of its shares were out on loan , according to research firm data explorers .
that compares with july - the month shares began trading under its rights issue - when 18 % of the shares were out on loan .
many hedge funds argue that short sellers are often pointing out an uncomfortable truth about the financial position of the companies whose shares they are selling - that they are not as valuable as people think they are .
as such , it is argued , they are often doing everyone a favour by exposing the real value of a company 's shares .
the financial equivalent of the boy who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes .
