these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .

since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .
cleaning out the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other cities such as berlin have followed frankfurt 's example in the early 1990s , the city authorities under then mayor andreas von schoeler joined forces with police to implement a zero tolerance policy towards the junkies who collected in the public areas in frankfurt 's gleaming financial district .
since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .
trailblazing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe drug use is an important tool of urban drug polics the " eastside " project in the industrial district of ostend which opened in 1992 has since advanced to become europe 's largest rehabilitation center , and a flagship venture for drug addict support programs . here , users are given access to clean needles , beds , prescription replacement drugs , medical care and training and employment options . meanwhile , the central station now boasts a crack smoking room , while some 4500 users a year visit the city 's several safe injection rooms , first introduced in 1994 .
the city also funds projects allowing addicts to be put on heroin maintenance therapy and methadone .
these initiatives have cemented frankfurt 's trailblazing status in the area of tackling drug dependency .
statistics show that the number of registered first-time users is on the decline .
in 2007 , 44 addicts overdosed - compared to 147 in 1991 .
michael tuchert , director of " eastside , " says the low point of the early 1990s is unlikely to be repeated .
however , he 's quick to point out that the future is far from rosy .

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 12.07.2008 international donors pledge over a billion euros for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference is being widely hailed as a success the international community have pledged a total of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- over the next three years to help build kosovo , the newest balkan nation to emerge from the breakup of yugoslavia . nearly 40 countries were represented at a donors ' conference in brussels organized by the european commission and attended by kosovan prime minister hashim thaci .
the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .

thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .

olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner , said it was now up to kosovo 's officials to " live up to the expectations they have raised in the eyes of the international community . "

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .

" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .
because much of the site will not be ready on time , entrance tickets will be discounted for several weeks . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .

" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .
a museum with green credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can get an idea of the scale of the ocean 's gentle giants one display was paid for by the environmentalist lobby group greenpeace , who invested 1.5 million euros to create full-scale replicas of seven whale species .
" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .
because much of the site will not be ready on time , entrance tickets will be discounted for several weeks . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we call on the chinese authorities to honor the rules for foreign journalists in china , " he said , referring to directives issued by chinese premier wen jiabao in december 2006 that were meant to make it easier for reporters to work in the country during the olympics . the directives call for journalists to only need to get the permission of organizations or individuals they want to interview , but not state authorities .
konken said that officials had begun to prohibit interviews or threaten chinese interview partners . konken welcomed an official chinese apology for a botched live broadcast of german public broadcaster zdf from the great wall .
officials had blocked the broadcast by holding their hands in front of the cameras . the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- also criticized new limitations on the work of journalists and welcomed a resolution passed by the european parliament which stated that china had advanced economically , but was lagging behind as far as democratic reforms and human rights were concerned . rog pointed out that some 80 journalists were still imprisoned because of their work and that censorship of media was still a big problem . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .
a museum with green credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can get an idea of the scale of the ocean 's gentle giants one display was paid for by the environmentalist lobby group greenpeace , who invested 1.5 million euros to create full-scale replicas of seven whale species .
" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .

although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .

" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 12.07.2008 frankfurt still germany 's drug capital , but learning to cope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these days , the drug scene is less visible in frankfurt but no less present frankfurt has long been struggling to contain its drug scene .
new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .
cleaning out the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other cities such as berlin have followed frankfurt 's example in the early 1990s , the city authorities under then mayor andreas von schoeler joined forces with police to implement a zero tolerance policy towards the junkies who collected in the public areas in frankfurt 's gleaming financial district .
since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .
trailblazing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe drug use is an important tool of urban drug polics the " eastside " project in the industrial district of ostend which opened in 1992 has since advanced to become europe 's largest rehabilitation center , and a flagship venture for drug addict support programs . here , users are given access to clean needles , beds , prescription replacement drugs , medical care and training and employment options . meanwhile , the central station now boasts a crack smoking room , while some 4500 users a year visit the city 's several safe injection rooms , first introduced in 1994 .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .

since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 12.07.2008 international donors pledge over a billion euros for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference is being widely hailed as a success the international community have pledged a total of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- over the next three years to help build kosovo , the newest balkan nation to emerge from the breakup of yugoslavia . nearly 40 countries were represented at a donors ' conference in brussels organized by the european commission and attended by kosovan prime minister hashim thaci .
the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "

but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombs ended serbian ethnic-cleansing in the region .
the eu now aims to take on a leading role in helping rebuild its administration and judiciary through its eulex mission .
olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner , said it was now up to kosovo 's officials to " live up to the expectations they have raised in the eyes of the international community . "
he also said there would be a strict monitoring of the funds to ensure that " every euro given out to kosovo " was accounted for and put to good use . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombs ended serbian ethnic-cleansing in the region .
the eu now aims to take on a leading role in helping rebuild its administration and judiciary through its eulex mission .
olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner , said it was now up to kosovo 's officials to " live up to the expectations they have raised in the eyes of the international community . "
he also said there would be a strict monitoring of the funds to ensure that " every euro given out to kosovo " was accounted for and put to good use . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .

" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .

olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner , said it was now up to kosovo 's officials to " live up to the expectations they have raised in the eyes of the international community . "

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .
unshakeable pillar of green germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to nuclear power in germany has traditionally been very strong in 2000 former german chancellor gerhard schröder and his spd-green coalition agreed to completely phase out nuclear power in germany by 2020 and invest heavily in renewable energies .
with gas and oil prices rocketing and fears about global warming growing , nuclear power is beginning to experience a global renaissance .
in germany , as well as concerns about securing the country 's energy supply and meeting environmental targets , there is also concern that the country 's technological knowhow - and with it potential export opportunities - are suffering because of the lack of prospects for the nuclear industry at home . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to nuclear power in germany has traditionally been very strong in 2000 former german chancellor gerhard schröder and his spd-green coalition agreed to completely phase out nuclear power in germany by 2020 and invest heavily in renewable energies .
with gas and oil prices rocketing and fears about global warming growing , nuclear power is beginning to experience a global renaissance .
in germany , as well as concerns about securing the country 's energy supply and meeting environmental targets , there is also concern that the country 's technological knowhow - and with it potential export opportunities - are suffering because of the lack of prospects for the nuclear industry at home . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 12.07.2008 frankfurt still germany 's drug capital , but learning to cope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these days , the drug scene is less visible in frankfurt but no less present frankfurt has long been struggling to contain its drug scene .
new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .
cleaning out the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other cities such as berlin have followed frankfurt 's example in the early 1990s , the city authorities under then mayor andreas von schoeler joined forces with police to implement a zero tolerance policy towards the junkies who collected in the public areas in frankfurt 's gleaming financial district .
since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we call on the chinese authorities to honor the rules for foreign journalists in china , " he said , referring to directives issued by chinese premier wen jiabao in december 2006 that were meant to make it easier for reporters to work in the country during the olympics . the directives call for journalists to only need to get the permission of organizations or individuals they want to interview , but not state authorities .
konken said that officials had begun to prohibit interviews or threaten chinese interview partners . konken welcomed an official chinese apology for a botched live broadcast of german public broadcaster zdf from the great wall .
officials had blocked the broadcast by holding their hands in front of the cameras . the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- also criticized new limitations on the work of journalists and welcomed a resolution passed by the european parliament which stated that china had advanced economically , but was lagging behind as far as democratic reforms and human rights were concerned . rog pointed out that some 80 journalists were still imprisoned because of their work and that censorship of media was still a big problem . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2008 dramatic museum attraction opens in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors come face to face with the big blue the ambitious oceanography museum opened its doors to the public in the north-eastern german port town of stralsund on saturday , july 12 .
it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .
a museum with green credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can get an idea of the scale of the ocean 's gentle giants one display was paid for by the environmentalist lobby group greenpeace , who invested 1.5 million euros to create full-scale replicas of seven whale species .
" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .
because much of the site will not be ready on time , entrance tickets will be discounted for several weeks . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .

heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .
unshakeable pillar of green germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to nuclear power in germany has traditionally been very strong in 2000 former german chancellor gerhard schröder and his spd-green coalition agreed to completely phase out nuclear power in germany by 2020 and invest heavily in renewable energies .
with gas and oil prices rocketing and fears about global warming growing , nuclear power is beginning to experience a global renaissance .
in germany , as well as concerns about securing the country 's energy supply and meeting environmental targets , there is also concern that the country 's technological knowhow - and with it potential export opportunities - are suffering because of the lack of prospects for the nuclear industry at home . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombs ended serbian ethnic-cleansing in the region .
the eu now aims to take on a leading role in helping rebuild its administration and judiciary through its eulex mission .
olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner , said it was now up to kosovo 's officials to " live up to the expectations they have raised in the eyes of the international community . "
he also said there would be a strict monitoring of the funds to ensure that " every euro given out to kosovo " was accounted for and put to good use . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .

since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .

the city also funds projects allowing addicts to be put on heroin maintenance therapy and methadone .
these initiatives have cemented frankfurt 's trailblazing status in the area of tackling drug dependency .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .
cleaning out the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other cities such as berlin have followed frankfurt 's example in the early 1990s , the city authorities under then mayor andreas von schoeler joined forces with police to implement a zero tolerance policy towards the junkies who collected in the public areas in frankfurt 's gleaming financial district .
since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .
trailblazing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe drug use is an important tool of urban drug polics the " eastside " project in the industrial district of ostend which opened in 1992 has since advanced to become europe 's largest rehabilitation center , and a flagship venture for drug addict support programs . here , users are given access to clean needles , beds , prescription replacement drugs , medical care and training and employment options . meanwhile , the central station now boasts a crack smoking room , while some 4500 users a year visit the city 's several safe injection rooms , first introduced in 1994 .
the city also funds projects allowing addicts to be put on heroin maintenance therapy and methadone .
these initiatives have cemented frankfurt 's trailblazing status in the area of tackling drug dependency .
statistics show that the number of registered first-time users is on the decline .
in 2007 , 44 addicts overdosed - compared to 147 in 1991 .
michael tuchert , director of " eastside , " says the low point of the early 1990s is unlikely to be repeated .
however , he 's quick to point out that the future is far from rosy .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .
cleaning out the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other cities such as berlin have followed frankfurt 's example in the early 1990s , the city authorities under then mayor andreas von schoeler joined forces with police to implement a zero tolerance policy towards the junkies who collected in the public areas in frankfurt 's gleaming financial district .
since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .
trailblazing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe drug use is an important tool of urban drug polics the " eastside " project in the industrial district of ostend which opened in 1992 has since advanced to become europe 's largest rehabilitation center , and a flagship venture for drug addict support programs . here , users are given access to clean needles , beds , prescription replacement drugs , medical care and training and employment options . meanwhile , the central station now boasts a crack smoking room , while some 4500 users a year visit the city 's several safe injection rooms , first introduced in 1994 .
the city also funds projects allowing addicts to be put on heroin maintenance therapy and methadone .
these initiatives have cemented frankfurt 's trailblazing status in the area of tackling drug dependency .
statistics show that the number of registered first-time users is on the decline .
in 2007 , 44 addicts overdosed - compared to 147 in 1991 .
michael tuchert , director of " eastside , " says the low point of the early 1990s is unlikely to be repeated .
however , he 's quick to point out that the future is far from rosy .
" the reasons for drug use are changing , " he says .
these days , he 's observed , " people are unable to deal with society and they need to take the edge of reality . " dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .

heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombs ended serbian ethnic-cleansing in the region .
the eu now aims to take on a leading role in helping rebuild its administration and judiciary through its eulex mission .
olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner , said it was now up to kosovo 's officials to " live up to the expectations they have raised in the eyes of the international community . "
he also said there would be a strict monitoring of the funds to ensure that " every euro given out to kosovo " was accounted for and put to good use . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 12.07.2008 frankfurt still germany 's drug capital , but learning to cope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these days , the drug scene is less visible in frankfurt but no less present frankfurt has long been struggling to contain its drug scene .
new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .
cleaning out the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other cities such as berlin have followed frankfurt 's example in the early 1990s , the city authorities under then mayor andreas von schoeler joined forces with police to implement a zero tolerance policy towards the junkies who collected in the public areas in frankfurt 's gleaming financial district .
since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .
trailblazing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe drug use is an important tool of urban drug polics the " eastside " project in the industrial district of ostend which opened in 1992 has since advanced to become europe 's largest rehabilitation center , and a flagship venture for drug addict support programs . here , users are given access to clean needles , beds , prescription replacement drugs , medical care and training and employment options . meanwhile , the central station now boasts a crack smoking room , while some 4500 users a year visit the city 's several safe injection rooms , first introduced in 1994 .
the city also funds projects allowing addicts to be put on heroin maintenance therapy and methadone .
these initiatives have cemented frankfurt 's trailblazing status in the area of tackling drug dependency .
statistics show that the number of registered first-time users is on the decline .
in 2007 , 44 addicts overdosed - compared to 147 in 1991 .
michael tuchert , director of " eastside , " says the low point of the early 1990s is unlikely to be repeated .
however , he 's quick to point out that the future is far from rosy .
" the reasons for drug use are changing , " he says .
these days , he 's observed , " people are unable to deal with society and they need to take the edge of reality . " dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .

since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .

the city also funds projects allowing addicts to be put on heroin maintenance therapy and methadone .
these initiatives have cemented frankfurt 's trailblazing status in the area of tackling drug dependency .
statistics show that the number of registered first-time users is on the decline .

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2008 germany 's anti-nuclear consensus crumbling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans still saying atomic power , no thanks ?
germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .
unshakeable pillar of green germany ?

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

" we call on the chinese authorities to honor the rules for foreign journalists in china , " he said , referring to directives issued by chinese premier wen jiabao in december 2006 that were meant to make it easier for reporters to work in the country during the olympics . the directives call for journalists to only need to get the permission of organizations or individuals they want to interview , but not state authorities .
konken said that officials had begun to prohibit interviews or threaten chinese interview partners . konken welcomed an official chinese apology for a botched live broadcast of german public broadcaster zdf from the great wall .
officials had blocked the broadcast by holding their hands in front of the cameras . the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- also criticized new limitations on the work of journalists and welcomed a resolution passed by the european parliament which stated that china had advanced economically , but was lagging behind as far as democratic reforms and human rights were concerned . rog pointed out that some 80 journalists were still imprisoned because of their work and that censorship of media was still a big problem . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we call on the chinese authorities to honor the rules for foreign journalists in china , " he said , referring to directives issued by chinese premier wen jiabao in december 2006 that were meant to make it easier for reporters to work in the country during the olympics . the directives call for journalists to only need to get the permission of organizations or individuals they want to interview , but not state authorities .

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to nuclear power in germany has traditionally been very strong in 2000 former german chancellor gerhard schröder and his spd-green coalition agreed to completely phase out nuclear power in germany by 2020 and invest heavily in renewable energies .
with gas and oil prices rocketing and fears about global warming growing , nuclear power is beginning to experience a global renaissance .
in germany , as well as concerns about securing the country 's energy supply and meeting environmental targets , there is also concern that the country 's technological knowhow - and with it potential export opportunities - are suffering because of the lack of prospects for the nuclear industry at home . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .

heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .
a museum with green credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can get an idea of the scale of the ocean 's gentle giants one display was paid for by the environmentalist lobby group greenpeace , who invested 1.5 million euros to create full-scale replicas of seven whale species .
" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .

" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .
later in the day he is scheduled to meet syria 's president bashar al-assad and the new lebanese president michel suleimann . relations between the two countries remain strained .
syria is suspected of being behind the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in 2005 . assad 's reception at the elysee palace marks his return to the international stage . the syrian president was shunned by sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac after hariri 's killing . on sunday , the date of the union 's official launch , sarkozy , israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the president of the palestinian authority , mahmoud abbas , are expected to issue a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathered leaders will be treated to events celebrating the french national holiday a three-hour summit meeting will follow , attended by representatives of more than 40 nations and major international organizations . the french president is hoping to make the launch of the union one of the centerpieces of france 's eu presidency and is marking the event with much pomp and ceremony . watered-down concept france celebrates its national holiday on monday , and the mediterranean union members have been invited to take part in the extravaganza . but there are fears that once the show is over , the union will still be little more than a rough draft , an idea looking for an identity . one problem is that , due largely to european bickering and rivalry , the union has been changed substantially from sarkozy 's grandiose original concept . earlier this year , sarkozy said the union would " change the world , " and during his presidential campaign he described it as a means " to end all hatreds , to make way for a great dream of peace and a great dream of civilization . " but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .
for example , turkey said it would not accept membership in the mediterranean union instead of eu membership , which sarkozy opposes . libyan leader muammar gaddafi violently denounced the project , saying it would " feed islamic terrorism " and force arab nations to sit at the same table with israel . some arab leaders had to be coaxed into attending or sending representatives because of israel 's presence , saying that the union should not be a " vehicle " for normalizing ties with israel .
and the israelis and palestinians have been markedly silent about the project . assad has already said he would not talk with olmert directly in paris , so the big question in israeli media has been whether the two men will actually shake hands . according to french media reports , the joint declaration that will be adopted during sunday 's three-hour summit meeting will be vague and formulaic . in addition , few concrete decisions are expected to be taken , other than that france and egypt will serve as the union 's first co-chairs . when it is all over , members and outsiders may be left wondering what all the shouting was about . dw staff -lrb- jg / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include the syrian president whose visit to paris marks his international comeback . the french president is hoping that the new mediterranean union - his own brainchild - will give new impetus to conflict resolution in the middle east . but there are fears that sarkozy 's clubmed concept lacks true substance . in paris , sarkozy met egyptian president hosni mubarak on saturday , july 12 .

" but the " dream " ran into hard reality from the very start , beginning with protests by german chancellor angela merkel , who objected to the eu - and therefore german taxpayers - paying for a project that would help french companies acquire lucrative contracts in water management , sea purification and nuclear energy . in addition , merkel wanted more eu focus and funds placed into the union 's expansion to the east . originally conceived as a union restricted to countries on the mediterranean basin , it was redrafted into an upgrade of the eu 's already existing barcelona process , with the aim of linking more closely the 17 non-eu nations along the mediterranean with the 27 eu members . the new union is meant to be centered around specific regional projects , such as water management , cleaning up the mediterranean , the transfer of nuclear energy technology , a joint program for managing immigration and cultural exchanges . however , merkel managed to get agreement that eu funds earmarked for the union during 2007 to 2013 would not surpass 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.84 billion -rrb- , a modest amount for such an ambitious project and which already has officials scrambling to find other funding sources . arab leaders unsettled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president muammar gaddafi has denounced the new grouping the group also received a rather cold reception from the countries it primarily concerns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2008 dramatic museum attraction opens in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors come face to face with the big blue the ambitious oceanography museum opened its doors to the public in the north-eastern german port town of stralsund on saturday , july 12 .
it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .
a museum with green credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can get an idea of the scale of the ocean 's gentle giants one display was paid for by the environmentalist lobby group greenpeace , who invested 1.5 million euros to create full-scale replicas of seven whale species .
" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .
because much of the site will not be ready on time , entrance tickets will be discounted for several weeks . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .

the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .

the world bank was among the international institutions also present in brussels .
the european union 's executive , the commission , emerged as the biggest single donor , with 500 million euros , followed by the united states -lrb- 256 million -rrb- .
virtually all of the 20 eu countries that have already recognized kosovo as an independent state pledged some money .
but the amounts committed by the eu 's heavyweights ranged from the 100 million euros provided by germany , to the just 2 million euros pledged by france , which currently holds the bloc 's rotating presidency .
non-eu countries norway , switzerland , saudi arabia and turkey also contributed sizeable amounts .
just short of target sum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was the biggest single donor the aggregate sum was slightly more than the 1 billion euros that organizers had expected , but just short of the 1.4 billion gap identified by the kosovo administration .
" this is a great success for my country and its citizens .
the conference marks a new chapter for the economy development of kosovo , " said thaci .
thaci vowed to reassure donors that the money would not be embezzled , saying his administration had already taken " concrete " and " daring " steps to fight corruption .
" this kind of support would not have come if donors were not convinced that good governance had been established , " he stressed .
some donors made their pledges conditional to the country adopting democratic reforms .
and there were also concerns that the administration might ignore the country 's serbian minority .
seeking to address such concerns , thaci said he was proud to lead a multi-ethnic , european and democratic state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's declaration of independence sparked unrest among ethnic serbs " we are well aware of our responsibilities , " said thaci .
" we will never disappoint you , " he added .
with a population of just over 2 million people , predominantly ethnic-albanian kosovo declared independence from serbia in february and adopted a new constitution in june .
the region is one of the poorest in europe , with high unemployment and powerful organized crime networks .
economic growth averaged just 3 per cent between 2003 and 2007 , well below the levels seen in neighbouring macedonia , bosnia or albania , according to international monetary fund estimates .
money for roads and schools most of the money committed on friday will be used for social and economic development purposes , such as the building of roads and schools .
about 100 million euros will be used to service kosovo 's debt .
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when nato bombs ended serbian ethnic-cleansing in the region .
the eu now aims to take on a leading role in helping rebuild its administration and judiciary through its eulex mission .
olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner , said it was now up to kosovo 's officials to " live up to the expectations they have raised in the eyes of the international community . "
he also said there would be a strict monitoring of the funds to ensure that " every euro given out to kosovo " was accounted for and put to good use . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .
cleaning out the scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other cities such as berlin have followed frankfurt 's example in the early 1990s , the city authorities under then mayor andreas von schoeler joined forces with police to implement a zero tolerance policy towards the junkies who collected in the public areas in frankfurt 's gleaming financial district .
since then , the drug scene has been less visible but no less present .
but although the battle to fight drug use might have been lost , frankfurt has since gained a reputation as pioneering in terms of urban drug addiction support policies .
the last 15 years have seen social workers , lawyers and police flesh out a support system that has been fine-tuned over the years to successfully help mitigate the seamier side of addiction .

the city also funds projects allowing addicts to be put on heroin maintenance therapy and methadone .

new statistics suggest it 's losing the battle , but the city 's progressive policies towards fighting addiction actually serve as a model for other cities . frankfurt is still germany 's drug capital , according to statistics revealed this week by the federal crime office .
928 drug offenses were registered per 100,000 frankfurt residents , according to the 2007 crime figures , the reasons for this dubious honor are manifold : the city is home to a busy international airport , and also functions as a national railway and autobahn intersection .
it 's a reputation the city has lived with since the 1980s , and it seems unlikely to shake it off in the foreseeable future .
but one change is apparent : the addicts are getting older .
one in four of the city 's estimated 9000 addicts is now over 40 .
this is largely due to the progressive support programs available , says irmgard vogt at frankfurt 's university of applied sciences .
" it 's time to start thinking about old people 's homes for junkies , " she adds .
" by the time they reach sixty , a drug addict is likely to be very frail . "
meanwhile , birgit wichelmann-werth , who runs the outreach project café fix at frankfurt station , has noticed that the place is a lot quieter than it used to be .
" older people like a bit more peace and quiet and are more unwilling to be alone , " she explains .

it contains 39 huge fish tanks and seven life-size models of whales . ozeaneum is an architecturally dramatic extension to the existing oceanography museum in stralsund , a town on the baltic coast .
inside visitors can discover what is going on in a mysterious world that makes up 70 per cent of our planet 's surface .
the exhibition focuses , in particular , on the world 's cold seas - the north sea , the baltic and the atlantic .
only 2.4 square kilometres of the deeps have ever been properly surveyed , using submarine probes .
statistically that is so little that it barely even counts as a sample of the whole surface worldwide .
" we still do n't even know about many species of creature in the deep oceans . " said harald benke , director of the oceanography museum .
striking shell for ocean treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is also intended to be an architectural attraction the old museum occupies a former church .
the 60 million euro -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- extension could not be more different , comprising four rounded , steel-clad buildings joined by a glass foyer .
although the structure nestles between ancient port warehouses and the whole town centre is a unesco world heritage site , nesco has approve the modern-style ozeaneum as an enrichment .
an architecture office from the german city of stuttgart , behnisch & partner , designed the oval and kidney-shaped buildings , which give something of an impression of giant rocks rubbed smooth by glaciers .
a museum with green credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can get an idea of the scale of the ocean 's gentle giants one display was paid for by the environmentalist lobby group greenpeace , who invested 1.5 million euros to create full-scale replicas of seven whale species .
" we want visitors to see exactly what we will lose if whales become extinct , " said thomas henningsen , who heads the greenpeace project .
the museum says the site contains the world 's best library of whale books and data .
the live fish at ozeaneum will live in the 39 aquarium tanks , which have a total capacity of 6 million litres .
that is enough water to fill a bathtub 60,000 times over .
to ensure it is disease free , it will come from the city water system and have 200 tons of salt added to make it similarly saline to sea-water .
benke says the site is more educational than commercial aquarium attractions such as sea life at other baltic coast towns . it encourages children and parents to consider questions such as " do fish drink ? " or why the deep sea is such an extreme environment .
ozeaneum also contains exhibits in old-fashioned glass cases and computerized displays .
benke says fellow museum experts have praised ozeaneum 's unique approach and hail it as one of the world 's best aquariums .
not everything has gone swimmingly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cod are among the coldwater fish that star in the exhibition but the two-year construction project has been plagued by delays and budget over-runs .
the biggest aquarium tank will have nothing but 2.6 million litres of water in it on saturday because there has not been enough time to stock it with the schools of small fish which are to live there soon .
a planned penguin room and a tank for herring have not even been built because the project ran out of cash , even though 10 million euros was added to the original 50 million euro budget .
by now , 52.6 million euros of taxpayer money has been granted to the project .
the museum is supposed to be self-supporting from now on , with at least 550,000 visitors annually needed to cover its running costs .

" we call on the chinese authorities to honor the rules for foreign journalists in china , " he said , referring to directives issued by chinese premier wen jiabao in december 2006 that were meant to make it easier for reporters to work in the country during the olympics . the directives call for journalists to only need to get the permission of organizations or individuals they want to interview , but not state authorities .
konken said that officials had begun to prohibit interviews or threaten chinese interview partners . konken welcomed an official chinese apology for a botched live broadcast of german public broadcaster zdf from the great wall .
officials had blocked the broadcast by holding their hands in front of the cameras . the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- also criticized new limitations on the work of journalists and welcomed a resolution passed by the european parliament which stated that china had advanced economically , but was lagging behind as far as democratic reforms and human rights were concerned . rog pointed out that some 80 journalists were still imprisoned because of their work and that censorship of media was still a big problem . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2008 germany 's anti-nuclear consensus crumbling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germans still saying atomic power , no thanks ?
germany 's governing coalition is looking increasingly split over the issue of atomic power as chancellor angela merkel makes her opposition to the nuclear phase-out in 2020 clearer . the conservative chancellor has flatly rejected her coalition partner 's spd proposal to include a ban on the building of new plants in the constitution in return for their agreement to prolong the operation of existing ones .
" i am in principle very cautious when it comes to changing the constitution .
the issue of energy provision has no place in the basic law , " she said in an interview to be published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend .
merkel continues to challenge atomic taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel first broke the taboo last year after russia 's oil pipeline blockade to europe merkel also said she did not believe that germany could completely do without nuclear power in the foreseeable future if it was also to reach its c02 emission targets . " for the next few years we will not be able to do without coal or nuclear energy , " she added .
she vowed to fight " to extend the operation times of our safe nuclear power plants in germany " and said the issue would arise in the next legislative period at the latest .
the concession to agree to an extension of operation times for some plants in exchange for a constitutional ban on new atomic plants was put forward by spd politician erhard eppler in early july , but rejected by the party leadership .
nuclear power divides the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany there were safety scares at two atomic plants in 2007 social democrat chairman hubertus heil warned his coalition partners against breaking the consensus over the phasing out of nuclear power .
" it is a social debate that split this country for thirty years , " he said .
heil said his party 's position on the issue was clear .
" we are sticking with the agreed phasing out of nuclear power .
there is no wobbling there .
the conservatives are also aware of that .
it is in our coalition agreement , " he added .
the spd chairman said if the cdu wanted to turn this into a election campaign issue that his party would not be afraid to take them on .
" what is clear is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power .
and the issue of storing waste has not been solved . "
he also stressed that the lengthening of operation times would chiefly serve to boost profits of energy giants rather than filling the pockets of german consumers .
" what we really need is investment in power plant technology and in renewable energies and energy efficiency , " said heil .
unshakeable pillar of green germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to nuclear power in germany has traditionally been very strong in 2000 former german chancellor gerhard schröder and his spd-green coalition agreed to completely phase out nuclear power in germany by 2020 and invest heavily in renewable energies .
with gas and oil prices rocketing and fears about global warming growing , nuclear power is beginning to experience a global renaissance .
in germany , as well as concerns about securing the country 's energy supply and meeting environmental targets , there is also concern that the country 's technological knowhow - and with it potential export opportunities - are suffering because of the lack of prospects for the nuclear industry at home . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opening day of the event at raf fairford was cancelled after heavy rain left the airfield and car parks waterlogged .
people are being refused entry at the gates and 1,500 pre-booked campsite arrivals have been turned away .
an information helpline has been set up on 01285 713000 .
it is the first time the tattoo has had to cancel one of its days in its 38-year history . "
it is anticipated that the show will be held on sunday , but it will be only for holders of tickets valid for sunday " tattoo spokesman " we are aware of the inconvenience our decision will have on the many thousands of people who have bought tickets for the saturday but the safety of the public is paramount , " said tim prince , air tattoo director .
more than 300 planes were due to take part and 100,000 visitors were expected to attend .
earlier in the week , air traffic controllers battled to clear a backlog of planes coming in after bad weather .
steve roden , 52 , and his wife leslie , 48 , travelled from haughley in suffolk for the annual event .
" we 've been here in our tent since tuesday .
it 's one of our two annual holidays , we take the week off and really look forward to it , " said mr roden .
" i 'm aircraft mad .
i do n't think i 've really grown up .
we always stay until monday to see the planes leave .
" i 'm sitting in our tent in the rain and the mud and to be honest i 'm gutted .
" the mud is so bad we ca n't even get our car off the site to visit cirencester so we 're stuck here . "
a tattoo spokesman said : " it is anticipated that the show will be held on sunday , but it will be only for holders of tickets valid for sunday . "
the decision to cancel the event on saturday does not affect the future of the show , the finance director of the air tattoo has said .
" it can stand the financial impact of losing the whole show if sunday does n't take place , " david hyam said .
" there are no long term factors affecting us there . "
the tattoo is staged in support of the royal air force charitable trust , a charity set up in 2005 .

this week , he came to the french school in johannesburg for a birthday function arranged by one of his charities , the nelson mandela children 's fund .
the children all wore t-shirts in honour of the man they call " the children 's champion " .
mandela arrived in one of his trademark tops , a flamboyant gold and white patterned shirt , buttoned at the collar .
eye contact he sat in a red armchair , in his element , surrounded by hundreds of children .
as he listened to the speeches , he looked slowly around the audience closest to him , then nodded and smiled in what seemed like a host of personal acknowledgements .
all of us felt we were being singled out by the old man with the white hair .
an hour later , nelson mandela made his way outside , into the grounds of the school to cut a huge birthday cake .
alongside him was his wife , graca machel , the woman he married 10 years ago on his 80th birthday .
there was a frenzy of excitement among adults and children alike as they pushed forward , all trying to capture a photograph .
as i watched nelson mandela preparing for his 90th birthday , i thought about those long years he spent in prison , at the mercy of the apartheid state .
i have an old " who 's who of south africa " in my bookcase , dating back to 1986 .
mandela 's entry is notable for the blank white square alongside his name .
" photograph prohibited by south african law , " it says .
no-one knew what nelson mandela looked like then .
he had been a prisoner for more than 20 years at that stage , and only a handful of people ever got to visit him .
one of them was helen suzman , the veteran liberal politician who for six years was the only female mp in south africa , and the sole voice of serious opposition in parliament .
when i met her this week , she told me about her first encounter with nelson mandela in 1967 .
she saw him in the prison on robben island .
and what struck her most forcibly was that this was a man who was " a real leader " , someone with an unmistakeable air of authority .
helen suzman campaigned hard to improve the conditions for mandela and the other political prisoners , but seven years were to pass before the authorities allowed her back to the island to see him again .
' dangerous terrorist ' when nelson mandela was eventually released in february 1990 , there were mixed emotions in south africa .
joy , of course , but also concern that after 27 years behind bars he might , as archbishop desmond tutu put it , emerge as " a man with feet of clay " .
and many white south africans , who had long been fed a diet of state propaganda , were even more apprehensive .
they had been led to believe that mandela was a dangerous terrorist who was intent on turning south africa into a communist state .
it was not long of course , before mandela laid all the anxieties to rest .
two weeks after his release from prison , i was on the tarmac at lusaka airport in zambia as a red carpet was rolled out and troupes of dancers gathered to welcome nelson mandela on his first journey out of south africa in nearly three decades .
his african national congress was still in exile in 1990 and this was a momentous reunion .
mandela was met off the small twin-engine plane by zambia 's president , kenneth kaunda who , being a man prone to shows of public emotion , always clasped a large white handkerchief .
mandela 's magic then mandela embraced his old comrades .
among them was joe slovo , a giant of the liberation struggle .
a little while later i asked slovo what mandela had first said to him after the 27-year-long interruption to their friendship .
" he just asked me how my three daughters were , " said slovo .
in recent years i have watched mandela working his magic on everyone from kofi annan to the manchester united football team . "
everyone just wants a tiny slice of this extraordinary man " like anyone approaching the age of 90 , he is taking things a lot easier now .
the public engagements are few and far between , and sadly , the days when he would speak freely and off-the-cuff are pretty much over .
mandela 's loyal assistant , zelda la grange , protects him doggedly .
there is no doubting the love that south africans have for madiba , to use his clan name .
the other day , i took a sounding from my hairdresser , a 20-something white afrikaans-speaker , who is almost too young to remember mandela 's release from prison .
" oh , he 's my icon , " she replied , without hesitation .
the former prisoner and president has risen far above the politics of this once troubled nation .
and everyone just wants a tiny slice of this extraordinary man .

when i met her this week , she told me about her first encounter with nelson mandela in 1967 .
she saw him in the prison on robben island .
and what struck her most forcibly was that this was a man who was " a real leader " , someone with an unmistakeable air of authority .
helen suzman campaigned hard to improve the conditions for mandela and the other political prisoners , but seven years were to pass before the authorities allowed her back to the island to see him again .
' dangerous terrorist ' when nelson mandela was eventually released in february 1990 , there were mixed emotions in south africa .
joy , of course , but also concern that after 27 years behind bars he might , as archbishop desmond tutu put it , emerge as " a man with feet of clay " .
and many white south africans , who had long been fed a diet of state propaganda , were even more apprehensive .
they had been led to believe that mandela was a dangerous terrorist who was intent on turning south africa into a communist state .
it was not long of course , before mandela laid all the anxieties to rest .
two weeks after his release from prison , i was on the tarmac at lusaka airport in zambia as a red carpet was rolled out and troupes of dancers gathered to welcome nelson mandela on his first journey out of south africa in nearly three decades .
his african national congress was still in exile in 1990 and this was a momentous reunion .
mandela was met off the small twin-engine plane by zambia 's president , kenneth kaunda who , being a man prone to shows of public emotion , always clasped a large white handkerchief .
mandela 's magic then mandela embraced his old comrades .
among them was joe slovo , a giant of the liberation struggle .
a little while later i asked slovo what mandela had first said to him after the 27-year-long interruption to their friendship .
" he just asked me how my three daughters were , " said slovo .
in recent years i have watched mandela working his magic on everyone from kofi annan to the manchester united football team .
everyone just wants a tiny slice of this extraordinary man like anyone approaching the age of 90 , he is taking things a lot easier now .
the public engagements are few and far between , and sadly , the days when he would speak freely and off-the-cuff are pretty much over .
mandela 's loyal assistant , zelda la grange , protects him doggedly .
there is no doubting the love that south africans have for madiba , to use his clan name .
the other day , i took a sounding from my hairdresser , a 20-something white afrikaans-speaker , who is almost too young to remember mandela 's release from prison .
" oh , he 's my icon , " she replied , without hesitation .
the former prisoner and president has risen far above the politics of this once troubled nation .
and everyone just wants a tiny slice of this extraordinary man .

this week , he came to the french school in johannesburg for a birthday function arranged by one of his charities , the nelson mandela children 's fund .
the children all wore t-shirts in honour of the man they call " the children 's champion " .
mandela arrived in one of his trademark tops , a flamboyant gold and white patterned shirt , buttoned at the collar .
eye contact he sat in a red armchair , in his element , surrounded by hundreds of children .
as he listened to the speeches , he looked slowly around the audience closest to him , then nodded and smiled in what seemed like a host of personal acknowledgements .
all of us felt we were being singled out by the old man with the white hair .
an hour later , nelson mandela made his way outside , into the grounds of the school to cut a huge birthday cake .
alongside him was his wife , graca machel , the woman he married 10 years ago on his 80th birthday .
there was a frenzy of excitement among adults and children alike as they pushed forward , all trying to capture a photograph .
