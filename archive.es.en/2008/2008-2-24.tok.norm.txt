german men had different partner preferences .
poles topped the list by far , followed by russians , turks and thai women in roughly equal numbers .
turkish women accounted for only 8 percent of all foreigners that german men marry . considering , however , that turkish citizens make up 25 percent of all foreign residents in germany - not counting an additional one-third ethnic turks who are german citizens - intermarriage rates are in reality very low , said dirk halm , a political scientist at the center for turkish studies in essen . integration problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- was not amused at turkish pm erdogan 's remarks about dangers of integration according to gonzalez-ferrer , even well-educated turkish women vastly prefer to marry ethnic turks over germans and go as far as importing husbands from turkey .

" there is tremendous pressure for young women to be married by say 23 , so worried parents start looking for potential suitors if they believe their daughter is ' over the hill ' , " she said . parental pressure in turkish families , however , is not the only factor which impedes inter-ethnic marriages .
lale akgun , a german-turkish parliamentarian of the social democrat party , believes that some germans too , feel uneasy about the prospect of a turkish in-law . " we need more dialogue between turks and germans , so that young people can feel free to make their own partner choices , without letting a person 's ethnicity to get in the way , " akgun said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expats around the world vote in democratic primary democrats who live outside the us also cast ballots on super tuesday .
and while voters in the us may be split between obama and clinton , the " beer-and-schnitzel " constituency in berlin was clear about who it preferred .
-lrb- 06.02.2008 -rrb- american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .
-lrb- 04.01.2008 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

" turks are far more likely to seek parental approval in the choice of a partner than germans are , " said yasemin karakasoglu , a migration expert at the university of bremen . " there is tremendous pressure for young women to be married by say 23 , so worried parents start looking for potential suitors if they believe their daughter is ' over the hill ' , " she said . parental pressure in turkish families , however , is not the only factor which impedes inter-ethnic marriages .
lale akgun , a german-turkish parliamentarian of the social democrat party , believes that some germans too , feel uneasy about the prospect of a turkish in-law . " we need more dialogue between turks and germans , so that young people can feel free to make their own partner choices , without letting a person 's ethnicity to get in the way , " akgun said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.02.2008 low rate of german-turkish marriages impedes integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is more easily said than practiced many german turks are pressured to marry only within their ethnic and religious group .
but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration . " whether turks are prepared to marry germans depends a lot on the importance of religion , " said amparo gonzalez-ferrer , a comparative sociologist at the juan march institute in madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coercion is rare , but arranged marriages are common the vast majority of turks are muslims in a predominantly christian culture that has become increasingly secular . " one reason why more -lsb- turkish -rsb- men marry germans is that islam permits them and not women to marry non-muslims , " gonzalez-ferrer said . according to the latest 2006 figures from the federal statistics office , turkish men accounted for 14 percent all foreigners that german women marry , followed by italians and americans .
german men had different partner preferences .
poles topped the list by far , followed by russians , turks and thai women in roughly equal numbers .
turkish women accounted for only 8 percent of all foreigners that german men marry . considering , however , that turkish citizens make up 25 percent of all foreign residents in germany - not counting an additional one-third ethnic turks who are german citizens - intermarriage rates are in reality very low , said dirk halm , a political scientist at the center for turkish studies in essen . integration problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- was not amused at turkish pm erdogan 's remarks about dangers of integration according to gonzalez-ferrer , even well-educated turkish women vastly prefer to marry ethnic turks over germans and go as far as importing husbands from turkey . " this could be their strategy for living independently from the in-laws , who stay behind in turkey " she said , adding that a german turkish woman would also have the upper hand in a relationship with a migrant husband , who is unfamiliar with germany . but the practice of importing spouses creates a new generation of migrants continually .
this becomes an integration problem , especially when turkish men import much younger , uneducated brides , whose vulnerability sometimes makes them easy targets for domestic violence . that is one reason why germany has recently upped the age limit to 18 for such unions , and now requires imported spouses to learn german before getting an entry visa . parental approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is enormous parental pressure on german turks , says spd parliamentarian lale akgun one should , however , make a distinction between forced marriages , in which a woman 's life could be at risk for defying the parental choice of a partner , and arranged marriages , which is a far more common practice . " turks are far more likely to seek parental approval in the choice of a partner than germans are , " said yasemin karakasoglu , a migration expert at the university of bremen . " there is tremendous pressure for young women to be married by say 23 , so worried parents start looking for potential suitors if they believe their daughter is ' over the hill ' , " she said . parental pressure in turkish families , however , is not the only factor which impedes inter-ethnic marriages .
lale akgun , a german-turkish parliamentarian of the social democrat party , believes that some germans too , feel uneasy about the prospect of a turkish in-law . " we need more dialogue between turks and germans , so that young people can feel free to make their own partner choices , without letting a person 's ethnicity to get in the way , " akgun said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expats around the world vote in democratic primary democrats who live outside the us also cast ballots on super tuesday .
and while voters in the us may be split between obama and clinton , the " beer-and-schnitzel " constituency in berlin was clear about who it preferred .
-lrb- 06.02.2008 -rrb- american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .
-lrb- 04.01.2008 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "

but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration .

" one reason why more -lsb- turkish -rsb- men marry germans is that islam permits them and not women to marry non-muslims , " gonzalez-ferrer said . according to the latest 2006 figures from the federal statistics office , turkish men accounted for 14 percent all foreigners that german women marry , followed by italians and americans .
german men had different partner preferences .
poles topped the list by far , followed by russians , turks and thai women in roughly equal numbers .
turkish women accounted for only 8 percent of all foreigners that german men marry . considering , however , that turkish citizens make up 25 percent of all foreign residents in germany - not counting an additional one-third ethnic turks who are german citizens - intermarriage rates are in reality very low , said dirk halm , a political scientist at the center for turkish studies in essen . integration problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- was not amused at turkish pm erdogan 's remarks about dangers of integration according to gonzalez-ferrer , even well-educated turkish women vastly prefer to marry ethnic turks over germans and go as far as importing husbands from turkey . " this could be their strategy for living independently from the in-laws , who stay behind in turkey " she said , adding that a german turkish woman would also have the upper hand in a relationship with a migrant husband , who is unfamiliar with germany . but the practice of importing spouses creates a new generation of migrants continually .
this becomes an integration problem , especially when turkish men import much younger , uneducated brides , whose vulnerability sometimes makes them easy targets for domestic violence . that is one reason why germany has recently upped the age limit to 18 for such unions , and now requires imported spouses to learn german before getting an entry visa . parental approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is enormous parental pressure on german turks , says spd parliamentarian lale akgun one should , however , make a distinction between forced marriages , in which a woman 's life could be at risk for defying the parental choice of a partner , and arranged marriages , which is a far more common practice .

but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration . " whether turks are prepared to marry germans depends a lot on the importance of religion , " said amparo gonzalez-ferrer , a comparative sociologist at the juan march institute in madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coercion is rare , but arranged marriages are common the vast majority of turks are muslims in a predominantly christian culture that has become increasingly secular . " one reason why more -lsb- turkish -rsb- men marry germans is that islam permits them and not women to marry non-muslims , " gonzalez-ferrer said . according to the latest 2006 figures from the federal statistics office , turkish men accounted for 14 percent all foreigners that german women marry , followed by italians and americans .
german men had different partner preferences .
poles topped the list by far , followed by russians , turks and thai women in roughly equal numbers .
turkish women accounted for only 8 percent of all foreigners that german men marry . considering , however , that turkish citizens make up 25 percent of all foreign residents in germany - not counting an additional one-third ethnic turks who are german citizens - intermarriage rates are in reality very low , said dirk halm , a political scientist at the center for turkish studies in essen . integration problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- was not amused at turkish pm erdogan 's remarks about dangers of integration according to gonzalez-ferrer , even well-educated turkish women vastly prefer to marry ethnic turks over germans and go as far as importing husbands from turkey . " this could be their strategy for living independently from the in-laws , who stay behind in turkey " she said , adding that a german turkish woman would also have the upper hand in a relationship with a migrant husband , who is unfamiliar with germany . but the practice of importing spouses creates a new generation of migrants continually .
this becomes an integration problem , especially when turkish men import much younger , uneducated brides , whose vulnerability sometimes makes them easy targets for domestic violence . that is one reason why germany has recently upped the age limit to 18 for such unions , and now requires imported spouses to learn german before getting an entry visa . parental approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is enormous parental pressure on german turks , says spd parliamentarian lale akgun one should , however , make a distinction between forced marriages , in which a woman 's life could be at risk for defying the parental choice of a partner , and arranged marriages , which is a far more common practice . " turks are far more likely to seek parental approval in the choice of a partner than germans are , " said yasemin karakasoglu , a migration expert at the university of bremen . " there is tremendous pressure for young women to be married by say 23 , so worried parents start looking for potential suitors if they believe their daughter is ' over the hill ' , " she said . parental pressure in turkish families , however , is not the only factor which impedes inter-ethnic marriages .
lale akgun , a german-turkish parliamentarian of the social democrat party , believes that some germans too , feel uneasy about the prospect of a turkish in-law . " we need more dialogue between turks and germans , so that young people can feel free to make their own partner choices , without letting a person 's ethnicity to get in the way , " akgun said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .

finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .

china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .

" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .

it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.02.2008 low rate of german-turkish marriages impedes integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is more easily said than practiced many german turks are pressured to marry only within their ethnic and religious group .
but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration . " whether turks are prepared to marry germans depends a lot on the importance of religion , " said amparo gonzalez-ferrer , a comparative sociologist at the juan march institute in madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coercion is rare , but arranged marriages are common the vast majority of turks are muslims in a predominantly christian culture that has become increasingly secular . " one reason why more -lsb- turkish -rsb- men marry germans is that islam permits them and not women to marry non-muslims , " gonzalez-ferrer said . according to the latest 2006 figures from the federal statistics office , turkish men accounted for 14 percent all foreigners that german women marry , followed by italians and americans .
german men had different partner preferences .
poles topped the list by far , followed by russians , turks and thai women in roughly equal numbers .
turkish women accounted for only 8 percent of all foreigners that german men marry . considering , however , that turkish citizens make up 25 percent of all foreign residents in germany - not counting an additional one-third ethnic turks who are german citizens - intermarriage rates are in reality very low , said dirk halm , a political scientist at the center for turkish studies in essen . integration problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- was not amused at turkish pm erdogan 's remarks about dangers of integration according to gonzalez-ferrer , even well-educated turkish women vastly prefer to marry ethnic turks over germans and go as far as importing husbands from turkey . " this could be their strategy for living independently from the in-laws , who stay behind in turkey " she said , adding that a german turkish woman would also have the upper hand in a relationship with a migrant husband , who is unfamiliar with germany . but the practice of importing spouses creates a new generation of migrants continually .
this becomes an integration problem , especially when turkish men import much younger , uneducated brides , whose vulnerability sometimes makes them easy targets for domestic violence . that is one reason why germany has recently upped the age limit to 18 for such unions , and now requires imported spouses to learn german before getting an entry visa . parental approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is enormous parental pressure on german turks , says spd parliamentarian lale akgun one should , however , make a distinction between forced marriages , in which a woman 's life could be at risk for defying the parental choice of a partner , and arranged marriages , which is a far more common practice . " turks are far more likely to seek parental approval in the choice of a partner than germans are , " said yasemin karakasoglu , a migration expert at the university of bremen . " there is tremendous pressure for young women to be married by say 23 , so worried parents start looking for potential suitors if they believe their daughter is ' over the hill ' , " she said . parental pressure in turkish families , however , is not the only factor which impedes inter-ethnic marriages .
lale akgun , a german-turkish parliamentarian of the social democrat party , believes that some germans too , feel uneasy about the prospect of a turkish in-law . " we need more dialogue between turks and germans , so that young people can feel free to make their own partner choices , without letting a person 's ethnicity to get in the way , " akgun said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.02.2008 europeans hopeful us democrats will rescue trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has high hopes for the democratic presidential hopefuls europeans think the next us president will be better .
they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expats around the world vote in democratic primary democrats who live outside the us also cast ballots on super tuesday .
and while voters in the us may be split between obama and clinton , the " beer-and-schnitzel " constituency in berlin was clear about who it preferred .
-lrb- 06.02.2008 -rrb- american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.02.2008 europeans hopeful us democrats will rescue trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has high hopes for the democratic presidential hopefuls europeans think the next us president will be better .
they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expats around the world vote in democratic primary democrats who live outside the us also cast ballots on super tuesday .
and while voters in the us may be split between obama and clinton , the " beer-and-schnitzel " constituency in berlin was clear about who it preferred .
-lrb- 06.02.2008 -rrb- american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.02.2008 europeans hopeful us democrats will rescue trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has high hopes for the democratic presidential hopefuls europeans think the next us president will be better .
they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expats around the world vote in democratic primary democrats who live outside the us also cast ballots on super tuesday .
and while voters in the us may be split between obama and clinton , the " beer-and-schnitzel " constituency in berlin was clear about who it preferred .
-lrb- 06.02.2008 -rrb- american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .
-lrb- 04.01.2008 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics opinion -pipe- 24.02.2008 opinion : trampling on the olympics ' wounded ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ideals on which the modern olympics were built have been betrayed , says dw 's nick amies .
turning a blind eye to china 's human rights abuses ahead of the beijing games is just adding insult to injury . when china was chosen to host the 2008 olympic games seven years ago , it made certain promises to improve its human rights record , lift restrictions on the freedom of the press and improve conditions for the people of beijing , among others .
with six months to go , china has instead expanded its crackdown on dissidents , tightened controls over non-governmental organizations and rounded up " undesirables , " such as migrants and the mentally ill .
in addition , china 's role as a supplier of weapons and military equipment to the sudanese government has prompted some human rights organizations and prominent individuals to call for a boycott of the games out of protest .
" china has worked in the un to ensure that whatever multi-national force is sent to sudan is the weakest possible , one that can do nothing to protect the population of darfur from the janjaweed militia which continues to kill thousands , " said john tkacik , a senior research fellow in asian studies at the heritage foundation , a washington-based think-tank .
" this is why china 's role in sudan is an issue and why people are upset . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick amies it would seem that now would be a perfect time to exert pressure on china over its failures .
but reports suggest that some european nations - belgium , the netherlands and britain among those named - have warned their athletes against using the games to make political statements and have considered gagging competitors from speaking out in protest against china on any sensitive topics .
these countries ' olympic committees claim to be adhering to the charter 's rule 51 which states that : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted at olympic sites . "
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire .
" we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . "
" the athletes will speak out if they are really unsatisfied , " adds dr. jens damm from the east asia faculty at berlin free university .
" the problem remains that , if this kind of restriction is imposed , it will be a kind of preemptive obedience which beijing will really be happy about .
but then , while the authorities might arrest chinese dissidents during the olympic games , they probably would not expel foreign athletes who speak out . "
while the british have since backed down - " we never intended to restrict any athlete 's freedom of speech , " boa spokeswoman miriam wilkens told dw-world.de - the fact that the uk was one of a few nations considering a restriction on the free speech of athletes has raised many questions about the games as an arena for political bargaining and appeasement in which commerce and influence tend to beat integrity into third place .
as many countries continue to pursue increased trade and strategic relations with the chinese - the way british prime minister gordon brown on his trip to china last month , when he announced a new partnership that could lead to tens of thousands of jobs for british workers - the beijing olympics become a test of the limits of free speech .
the new boundaries of what it is acceptable to say seem to end where lucrative contracts begin .
all of which indicates that the talk of boycotts and protests will come to little or nothing .
china 's olympic games will take place unhindered .
all those leaders who make token calls for reform will enjoy the hospitality , their countries will take part without causing an international incident and everyone will go home happy with their medals .
what will be left when the world 's eyes turn away again will be the memory of an opportunity missed , the reinforcement of curbs to freedom and the dying sound of another nail being banged into the olympic coffin . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german men had different partner preferences .
poles topped the list by far , followed by russians , turks and thai women in roughly equal numbers .
turkish women accounted for only 8 percent of all foreigners that german men marry . considering , however , that turkish citizens make up 25 percent of all foreign residents in germany - not counting an additional one-third ethnic turks who are german citizens - intermarriage rates are in reality very low , said dirk halm , a political scientist at the center for turkish studies in essen . integration problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- was not amused at turkish pm erdogan 's remarks about dangers of integration according to gonzalez-ferrer , even well-educated turkish women vastly prefer to marry ethnic turks over germans and go as far as importing husbands from turkey .

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.02.2008 europeans hopeful us democrats will rescue trans-atlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has high hopes for the democratic presidential hopefuls europeans think the next us president will be better .
they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expats around the world vote in democratic primary democrats who live outside the us also cast ballots on super tuesday .
and while voters in the us may be split between obama and clinton , the " beer-and-schnitzel " constituency in berlin was clear about who it preferred .
-lrb- 06.02.2008 -rrb- american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .
-lrb- 04.01.2008 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.02.2008 low rate of german-turkish marriages impedes integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is more easily said than practiced many german turks are pressured to marry only within their ethnic and religious group .
but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration . " whether turks are prepared to marry germans depends a lot on the importance of religion , " said amparo gonzalez-ferrer , a comparative sociologist at the juan march institute in madrid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coercion is rare , but arranged marriages are common the vast majority of turks are muslims in a predominantly christian culture that has become increasingly secular . " one reason why more -lsb- turkish -rsb- men marry germans is that islam permits them and not women to marry non-muslims , " gonzalez-ferrer said . according to the latest 2006 figures from the federal statistics office , turkish men accounted for 14 percent all foreigners that german women marry , followed by italians and americans .
german men had different partner preferences .
poles topped the list by far , followed by russians , turks and thai women in roughly equal numbers .
turkish women accounted for only 8 percent of all foreigners that german men marry . considering , however , that turkish citizens make up 25 percent of all foreign residents in germany - not counting an additional one-third ethnic turks who are german citizens - intermarriage rates are in reality very low , said dirk halm , a political scientist at the center for turkish studies in essen . integration problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's merkel -lrb- right -rrb- was not amused at turkish pm erdogan 's remarks about dangers of integration according to gonzalez-ferrer , even well-educated turkish women vastly prefer to marry ethnic turks over germans and go as far as importing husbands from turkey . " this could be their strategy for living independently from the in-laws , who stay behind in turkey " she said , adding that a german turkish woman would also have the upper hand in a relationship with a migrant husband , who is unfamiliar with germany . but the practice of importing spouses creates a new generation of migrants continually .
this becomes an integration problem , especially when turkish men import much younger , uneducated brides , whose vulnerability sometimes makes them easy targets for domestic violence . that is one reason why germany has recently upped the age limit to 18 for such unions , and now requires imported spouses to learn german before getting an entry visa . parental approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is enormous parental pressure on german turks , says spd parliamentarian lale akgun one should , however , make a distinction between forced marriages , in which a woman 's life could be at risk for defying the parental choice of a partner , and arranged marriages , which is a far more common practice . " turks are far more likely to seek parental approval in the choice of a partner than germans are , " said yasemin karakasoglu , a migration expert at the university of bremen . " there is tremendous pressure for young women to be married by say 23 , so worried parents start looking for potential suitors if they believe their daughter is ' over the hill ' , " she said . parental pressure in turkish families , however , is not the only factor which impedes inter-ethnic marriages .
lale akgun , a german-turkish parliamentarian of the social democrat party , believes that some germans too , feel uneasy about the prospect of a turkish in-law . " we need more dialogue between turks and germans , so that young people can feel free to make their own partner choices , without letting a person 's ethnicity to get in the way , " akgun said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expats around the world vote in democratic primary democrats who live outside the us also cast ballots on super tuesday .
and while voters in the us may be split between obama and clinton , the " beer-and-schnitzel " constituency in berlin was clear about who it preferred .
-lrb- 06.02.2008 -rrb- american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .
-lrb- 04.01.2008 -rrb- surveys show us image plummeting in germany five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .

" one reason why more -lsb- turkish -rsb- men marry germans is that islam permits them and not women to marry non-muslims , " gonzalez-ferrer said . according to the latest 2006 figures from the federal statistics office , turkish men accounted for 14 percent all foreigners that german women marry , followed by italians and americans .
german men had different partner preferences .

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope a democrat in the white house will reinvigorate trans-atlantic ties .
but the candidates are n't necessarily much more in tune with europe . europeans ' interest in the us primaries and caucuses is immense : leading german newsmagazine der spiegel even devoted its title story to democrat barack obama last week , and the internet is alive with young europeans commenting on the campaigns in innumerable blogs and forums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have been unimpressed by the americans ' actions in iraq many europeans connect the election of a new us president with the hope for a new beginning in trans-atlantic relations , which suffered setbacks due to numerous controversies , from george w. bush 's uncompromising approach to climate change to his foray into the iraqi desert .
to many europeans , everything will get better once there 's a new president .
and if he or she is a democrat , they believe , it 's guaranteed .
regardless of how passionately europeans follow the duel between barack obama and hillary clinton , europe plays a negligible role in the top democratic contenders ' campaigns .
aside from a few sentences in speeches and essays , the two have hardly said a word about europe .
and according to some , european hopes will likely be dashed .
" a fundamental new evaluation of the trans-atlantic relationship will not take place , " said esther brimmer , research director at the center for transatlantic relations -lrb- ctr -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington , dc .
but the tone will change .
" obama and clinton will make themselves out to be more cooperative , more international .
and for every american president , europe remains the most important partner , " brimmer said .
us wo n't allow europe to dictate on points of contention between the us and europe , such as climate change or human rights , the europeans could expect significantly more cooperation than in the past , she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new president may take a different approach to climate change but whether under a president obama or a president clinton , the us would demand the leadership role in fighting climate change .
it would also refuse to let the europeans dictate what should be done , brimmer said .
and it 's inconceivable that a new president would ratify the statutes of the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , an issue that looms large for europeans .
" with so much military personnel all over the world , the us does n't want to be subjected to politically motivated accusations from other states at the icc , " brimmer said .
but a new president would n't try to actively thwart the icc , as the bush administration did at the start .
and when it comes to iraq and iran 's nuclear ambitions , a president obama or clinton would discuss the issues more closely with the europeans , brimmer reckoned .
obama attracted attention last year by suggesting he would try to engage in direct talks with iran .
clinton called the suggestion naive .
grown apart brimmer said the biggest difference between the two democrats in regard to europe was that obama wanted to set the course for where the us would be in 30 or 40 years , particularly in terms of climate change and international dialogue .
clinton , on the other hand , was focused on improving america 's standing in the world in the near term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 does n't loom as large for europeans as it does for americans this different approach " naturally influences the role europe plays for the us in the mid-term , " brimmer said .
though bush 's foreign policy may have caused a storm over the atlantic , actually there had been a fundamental , structural change in the trans-atlantic relationship , said karen donfried , vice president of the german marshall funds of the united states .
" the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , hit the us at a time when the europeans - after the end of the cold war - felt safer than ever , " she said .
the us and europe had not only developed different interests , but were also no longer united by a common enemy .
polls reinforce that view : while americans identify terrorism as the number one threat , europeans say climate change is the biggest problem .
finding a common cause the rise of new ' super powers , ' such as china and india could , however , bring americans and europeans closer together again , according to donfried .
" the eu and the us must work together to integrate countries that come from outside this tradition into the global political system they have so clearly molded , " she said .
in that sense , obama and clinton would certainly view europeans as effective partners .
but the " europeans would have to finally get their house in order , " donfried said .
" in haggling over a new european constitution and the lisbon reform treaty , the europeans were so occupied with themselves that they were neither united enough nor did they have the necessary view of the outside world to be this effective partner , " she said . ranty islam -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

doctors at one of the country 's largest eating disorders treatment centres said they needed to act more responsibly .
the eating disorders charity , b-eat , said little progress had been made on combating " pro-ana " sites .
the networking sites said it was hard to distinguish between support groups and " pro-anorexia " groups .
but a spokesperson for myspace said they were working with organisations such as b-eat .
over 1.1 million britons are known to suffer from an eating disorder .
the vast majority are women , although experts believe the numbers could actually be much higher as many cases go undiagnosed . "
social networking sites can censor their material and we expect them to act responsibly " dr ty glover , consultant psychiatrist specialists and charities say the rise of the internet and new media has played a significant part in providing easier access to information on how to get thin .
research has shown that young women exposed to pro-ana websites felt more negative , had lower self-esteem , perceived themselves as heavier and were more likely to compare their bodies with other women .
' common theme ' dr ty glover , consultant psychiatrist on the eating disorders unit at cheadle royal hospital , said it had proven difficult to shut down pro-ana websites , but the situation was slightly different for sites such as facebook .
" social networking sites can censor their material and we expect them to act responsibly , " he said . "
rather than censor these groups , we are working to create partnership " myspace spokesperson " we are horrified at the content of these sites and the tips they give on how to be thin .
" people with eating disorders are extremely vulnerable and often have very low self esteem , so pro-ana and pro-mia sites can be very damaging as they are sending out the wrong advice . "
it is thought there are more than 500 pro-ana and pro-mia internet sites .
cheadle mp mark hunter has asked the government to promote awareness of the dangers of such websites .
" these websites are truly despicable and only help to reinforce the myth that having an eating disorder is n't a problem , " he said .
susan ringwood from b-eat , who are due to launch a report this week calling for better support for families of people with eating disorders , said the websites encouraged people to avoid treatment .
" we believe that the sites should act responsibly .
" they have acted to remove other content that is seen as ' dangerous ' , or could encourage young people to do dangerous things . "
she said they were not calling for such sites to be banned completely , but for greater awareness of the dangers and for more support online so the sites are not the " only refuge " .
but shannon bonnette , who is recovering from anorexia , told the bbc that looking at anorexia web pages actually helped her overcome the illness .
" what i found through visiting those site was that there was a common theme - everybody stays miserable , " she said .
a spokesperson for myspace said : " it 's often very tricky to distinguish between support groups for users who are suffering from eating disorders and groups that might be termed as " pro " anorexia or bulimia .
" rather than censor these groups , we are working to create partnerships with organisations like b-eat .
" we have also placed ads on pro-anorexia profiles for up to a year from the national eating disorder association to target these groups with positive messaging about how and where they can get help . "
a spokesperson for facebook said the site supported the free flow of information .
" many facebook groups relate to controversial topics ; this alone is not a reason to disable a group .
" in cases where content is reported and found to violate the site 's terms of use , facebook will remove it . "
read a selection of your comments on this story : i recently realized that i suffer from anorexia , and have begun treatment .
my case is probably on the mild side , but even so i am astonished that anyone could want to be anorexic .
the dreadful constipation , the depression , the feeling of isolation - it 's miserable being anorexic , and dangerous to your health .
most people do not realize how damaging anorexia is to the body .
if the social networking sites do not crack down on these pro-ana and pro-mia sites , they will be placing many girls and boys with poor self-esteem in harm 's way .
it could even lead to a lawsuit , and i 'm certain myspace etc. would find that vastly inconvenient .
ces , usa pro-anorexia sites , like anything which advocates harmful lifestyles , should ideally be banned .
unfortunately , this just drives them underground .
this makes it even more difficult for those caring for sufferers of eating disorders to understand what messages and signals are being sent .
what is important is that everyone should be aware of how sudden , death from starvation can occur , especially when it is combined with excessive exercise ! !
gyms should be aware that people with eating disorders will over-exercise in order to burn off more calories .
these people are then putting themselves in greater danger .
i speak from the experience of seeing my daughter do this .
no gym ever suggested to her that she was no longer fit enough to maintain her exercise regime , suggested a shorter time , or stopped her from using their facilities .
she did reduce her exercise when she began to recover , and , with more food put on some weight .
unfortunately , after a few months she relapsed , and she died last year .
it is this fact that people should be made aware of .
anorexia is not a fad to lose weight ; she wanted to eat , but could not bear to do so .
jenny , sheffield i found much on anorexia on myspace when i did a search , those pages i looked at seemed to be well intentioned with good advice .
i can believe there are sites catering to the idea that anorexia is good though , just could not find them quickly .
what bothers me is not that these sites exist but that the people who should see them as an opportunity to learn how these people think and engage them at their own level in a non confrontational way -lrb- anonymously even -rrb- are so blinkered .
they may be otherwise intelligent people but they lack any kind of vision and apparent understanding how the internet community works .
all they do is some quasi- scientific study and come to the conclusion such sites may reinforce anorexic behaviour .
anyway , censor them and alienate them .
genius idea .
come one people .
do some of that thinking out side the box .
david reynolds , plymouth uk i am the senior administrator of an eating disorder message board , and whereas our forum is definitely on the pro-recovery side of the " debate " , it has to be said that websites do n't cause eating disorders .
skinny celebs do n't cause eating disorders .
eating disorders are almost always caused by severe childhood trauma either from abuse or severe emotional distress .
i for one would like to see the bbc actually produce a documentary that tackles the real issues , with real science instead of just blaming anorexia on " posh spice " tom , hackettstown , nj i have never been diagnosed with an eating disorder , although like most teenagers i had a phase where i starved myself and purged when i did eat .
we live in a country of free speech and i do not think that pro-ed websites should be banned .
they can not give people eating disorders , the person must already be well on their way .
whilst agreeing that pro-ana / mia websites are not the best means of support , they can be useful in stopping the feelings of isolation that sufferers are likely to have .
also it makes it easier to target those with eating disorders as a lot of them will be on pro-ed sites !
rachel , london to say one supports " the free flow of information " without first deciding whether the information is ethical or not , is not acceptable .
i have worked with anorexia patients who used the web to support their illness .
they " knew " that participating in these sites was self destructive , but like other addicts , they found it very difficult to resist the allure , and seeming support of these sites .
we need national and international bodies to search out and ban these sites .
also i would suggest hefty fines for sites like facebook who do n't do enough to keep there pages safe .
their owners can well afford to insure ethical behaviour on their sites .
to see the suffering of anorexia close up is heart breaking , especially for the extended families .
we must do all we can to limit this deadly illness .
patrick tummon , cape town south africa when i was in high school , my girlfriend had a serious eating disorder .
when i confronted her about it she would n't admit to it right away .
eventually , we got through it together .
however , it was made a lot harder because her friends were doing it .
i think that girls are especially social creatures and will use sites that are pro-ana or pro-mia to justify / increase their disorders .
i know there is a lot of concern about censoring web material , but if facebook was around 6-7 years ago when i was dealing with it , i think it would have been even harder for her to overcome .
christian , wheaton , usa having just read this story , i decided to have a look at one of these sites .
i was shocked and sickened by it .
the people who run sites like this are going to be responsible for the needless deaths of many young people .
sw , york , uk although not a direct experience - i find it disheartening that an mp would say that " these websites are truly despicable " - come on .
generally the contributors to these websites are anorexics with low self image - the last thing they need is for some mis-informed mp to spout off about them being despicable !
maybe the mp should control his messages - please !
barry hearne , johannesburg south africa if we are considering anorexia -lrb- and to some extent emotional overeating or obesity -rrb- as a form of self-harm , then pro anorexia or pro obesity sites should equally be areas of concern and debate .
each disorder has the potential to end life prematurely .
these web sites should come with some form of responsibility , and resources of contact for consumers to activate support .
anorexia and obesity are both life threatening in their extreme and acute presentation .
both have been related to a form of neurological or brain dysfunction .
personal choice appears to play a smaller part to play in managing either anorexia or obesity according to research , although engagement and current easily accessible information is important .
these key websites can become more empowering and informative to send people inspiring anecdotes of recovery .
pro anorexia is a very risky stance to promote is has very real consequences of mortality .
parents would and should be very concerned .
allied health has a responsibility to respond and join in the debate to activate change .
yvonne mitchell , st. albans , herts imagine a world where , instead of leaping on the internet as a convenient scapegoat , we tackled the all-pervasive lies about what women should look like that are the real cause of anorexia .
no , i did n't think you would .

this makes it even more difficult for those caring for sufferers of eating disorders to understand what messages and signals are being sent .
what is important is that everyone should be aware of how sudden , death from starvation can occur , especially when it is combined with excessive exercise ! !
gyms should be aware that people with eating disorders will over-exercise in order to burn off more calories .
these people are then putting themselves in greater danger .
i speak from the experience of seeing my daughter do this .
no gym ever suggested to her that she was no longer fit enough to maintain her exercise regime , suggested a shorter time , or stopped her from using their facilities .
she did reduce her exercise when she began to recover , and , with more food put on some weight .
unfortunately , after a few months she relapsed , and she died last year .

anorexia is not a fad to lose weight ; she wanted to eat , but could not bear to do so .

what bothers me is not that these sites exist but that the people who should see them as an opportunity to learn how these people think and engage them at their own level in a non confrontational way -lrb- anonymously even -rrb- are so blinkered .
they may be otherwise intelligent people but they lack any kind of vision and apparent understanding how the internet community works .

social networking sites can censor their material and we expect them to act responsibly dr ty glover , consultant psychiatrist specialists and charities say the rise of the internet and new media has played a significant part in providing easier access to information on how to get thin .
research has shown that young women exposed to pro-ana websites felt more negative , had lower self-esteem , perceived themselves as heavier and were more likely to compare their bodies with other women .
' common theme ' dr ty glover , consultant psychiatrist on the eating disorders unit at cheadle royal hospital , said it had proven difficult to shut down pro-ana websites , but the situation was slightly different for sites such as facebook .
" social networking sites can censor their material and we expect them to act responsibly , " he said .
rather than censor these groups , we are working to create partnership myspace spokesperson " we are horrified at the content of these sites and the tips they give on how to be thin .
" people with eating disorders are extremely vulnerable and often have very low self esteem , so pro-ana and pro-mia sites can be very damaging as they are sending out the wrong advice . "
it is thought there are more than 500 pro-ana and pro-mia internet sites .
cheadle mp mark hunter has asked the government to promote awareness of the dangers of such websites .
" these websites are truly despicable and only help to reinforce the myth that having an eating disorder is n't a problem , " he said .
susan ringwood from b-eat , who are due to launch a report this week calling for better support for families of people with eating disorders , said the websites encouraged people to avoid treatment .
" we believe that the sites should act responsibly .
" they have acted to remove other content that is seen as ' dangerous ' , or could encourage young people to do dangerous things . "
she said they were not calling for such sites to be banned completely , but for greater awareness of the dangers and for more support online so the sites are not the " only refuge " .
but shannon bonnette , who is recovering from anorexia , told the bbc that looking at anorexia web pages actually helped her overcome the illness .
" what i found through visiting those site was that there was a common theme - everybody stays miserable , " she said .
a spokesperson for myspace said : " it 's often very tricky to distinguish between support groups for users who are suffering from eating disorders and groups that might be termed as " pro " anorexia or bulimia .
" rather than censor these groups , we are working to create partnerships with organisations like b-eat .
" we have also placed ads on pro-anorexia profiles for up to a year from the national eating disorder association to target these groups with positive messaging about how and where they can get help . "
a spokesperson for facebook said the site supported the free flow of information .
" many facebook groups relate to controversial topics ; this alone is not a reason to disable a group .
" in cases where content is reported and found to violate the site 's terms of use , facebook will remove it . "
read a selection of your comments on this story : i recently realized that i suffer from anorexia , and have begun treatment .
my case is probably on the mild side , but even so i am astonished that anyone could want to be anorexic .
the dreadful constipation , the depression , the feeling of isolation - it 's miserable being anorexic , and dangerous to your health .
most people do not realize how damaging anorexia is to the body .
if the social networking sites do not crack down on these pro-ana and pro-mia sites , they will be placing many girls and boys with poor self-esteem in harm 's way .
it could even lead to a lawsuit , and i 'm certain myspace etc. would find that vastly inconvenient .
ces , usa pro-anorexia sites , like anything which advocates harmful lifestyles , should ideally be banned .
unfortunately , this just drives them underground .
this makes it even more difficult for those caring for sufferers of eating disorders to understand what messages and signals are being sent .
what is important is that everyone should be aware of how sudden , death from starvation can occur , especially when it is combined with excessive exercise ! !
gyms should be aware that people with eating disorders will over-exercise in order to burn off more calories .
these people are then putting themselves in greater danger .
i speak from the experience of seeing my daughter do this .
no gym ever suggested to her that she was no longer fit enough to maintain her exercise regime , suggested a shorter time , or stopped her from using their facilities .
she did reduce her exercise when she began to recover , and , with more food put on some weight .
unfortunately , after a few months she relapsed , and she died last year .
it is this fact that people should be made aware of .
anorexia is not a fad to lose weight ; she wanted to eat , but could not bear to do so .
jenny , sheffield i found much on anorexia on myspace when i did a search , those pages i looked at seemed to be well intentioned with good advice .
i can believe there are sites catering to the idea that anorexia is good though , just could not find them quickly .
what bothers me is not that these sites exist but that the people who should see them as an opportunity to learn how these people think and engage them at their own level in a non confrontational way -lrb- anonymously even -rrb- are so blinkered .
they may be otherwise intelligent people but they lack any kind of vision and apparent understanding how the internet community works .
all they do is some quasi- scientific study and come to the conclusion such sites may reinforce anorexic behaviour .
anyway , censor them and alienate them .
genius idea .
come one people .
do some of that thinking out side the box .
david reynolds , plymouth uk i am the senior administrator of an eating disorder message board , and whereas our forum is definitely on the pro-recovery side of the " debate " , it has to be said that websites do n't cause eating disorders .
skinny celebs do n't cause eating disorders .
eating disorders are almost always caused by severe childhood trauma either from abuse or severe emotional distress .
i for one would like to see the bbc actually produce a documentary that tackles the real issues , with real science instead of just blaming anorexia on " posh spice " tom , hackettstown , nj i have never been diagnosed with an eating disorder , although like most teenagers i had a phase where i starved myself and purged when i did eat .
we live in a country of free speech and i do not think that pro-ed websites should be banned .
they can not give people eating disorders , the person must already be well on their way .
whilst agreeing that pro-ana / mia websites are not the best means of support , they can be useful in stopping the feelings of isolation that sufferers are likely to have .
also it makes it easier to target those with eating disorders as a lot of them will be on pro-ed sites !
rachel , london to say one supports " the free flow of information " without first deciding whether the information is ethical or not , is not acceptable .
i have worked with anorexia patients who used the web to support their illness .
they " knew " that participating in these sites was self destructive , but like other addicts , they found it very difficult to resist the allure , and seeming support of these sites .
we need national and international bodies to search out and ban these sites .
also i would suggest hefty fines for sites like facebook who do n't do enough to keep there pages safe .
their owners can well afford to insure ethical behaviour on their sites .
to see the suffering of anorexia close up is heart breaking , especially for the extended families .
we must do all we can to limit this deadly illness .
patrick tummon , cape town south africa when i was in high school , my girlfriend had a serious eating disorder .
when i confronted her about it she would n't admit to it right away .
eventually , we got through it together .
however , it was made a lot harder because her friends were doing it .
i think that girls are especially social creatures and will use sites that are pro-ana or pro-mia to justify / increase their disorders .
i know there is a lot of concern about censoring web material , but if facebook was around 6-7 years ago when i was dealing with it , i think it would have been even harder for her to overcome .
christian , wheaton , usa having just read this story , i decided to have a look at one of these sites .
i was shocked and sickened by it .
the people who run sites like this are going to be responsible for the needless deaths of many young people .
sw , york , uk although not a direct experience - i find it disheartening that an mp would say that " these websites are truly despicable " - come on .
generally the contributors to these websites are anorexics with low self image - the last thing they need is for some mis-informed mp to spout off about them being despicable !
maybe the mp should control his messages - please !
barry hearne , johannesburg south africa if we are considering anorexia -lrb- and to some extent emotional overeating or obesity -rrb- as a form of self-harm , then pro anorexia or pro obesity sites should equally be areas of concern and debate .
each disorder has the potential to end life prematurely .
these web sites should come with some form of responsibility , and resources of contact for consumers to activate support .
anorexia and obesity are both life threatening in their extreme and acute presentation .
both have been related to a form of neurological or brain dysfunction .
personal choice appears to play a smaller part to play in managing either anorexia or obesity according to research , although engagement and current easily accessible information is important .
these key websites can become more empowering and informative to send people inspiring anecdotes of recovery .
pro anorexia is a very risky stance to promote is has very real consequences of mortality .
parents would and should be very concerned .
allied health has a responsibility to respond and join in the debate to activate change .
yvonne mitchell , st. albans , herts imagine a world where , instead of leaping on the internet as a convenient scapegoat , we tackled the all-pervasive lies about what women should look like that are the real cause of anorexia .
no , i did n't think you would .

oscar-nominated actor and director kenneth branagh made a guest appearance at la charrette for the world premiere of danny boyle 's alien love triangle .
the screening of the sci-fi comedy gave the tiny cinema in a quiet terraced street an out-of-this-world send-off .
the cinema will now be dismantled and rebuilt at the gower heritage centre .
belfast-born branagh walked up the red carpet between two end of terrace houses for the black-tie screening at la charrette .
" this is a fantastic , " he said .
" it is a romantic idea and a symbol of why people go to the cinema .
" this is like the street i grew up on so i feel completely at home . "
la charrette in gorseinon , near swansea , was due to close in november but was kept open to host the premiere .
in pictures : la charrette the screening was organised by film critic mark kermode after he featured the venue on bbc2 's the culture show .
founded in 1955 by the late gwyn phillips , the crumbling cinema had become too costly to maintain but kermode lobbied the film industry to give la charrette a memorable send-off .
after contacting all of the uk 's major film distributors and sending them pictures of la charrette , mr kermode said he received offers of several upcoming movies to bring down the final curtain .
but he decided to ask alien love triangle 's producer andrew macdonald for the film because he wanted " something special , something unique , something unattainable " .
the 30-minute movie was made in 2002 by danny boyle , director of trainspotting , 28 days later and sunshine .
in addition to branagh , it also stars courtney cox and heather graham .
film critic mark kermode was the man behind the fitting finale speaking before the screening , branagh said alien love triangle was a " lost film " by one of " our greatest directors " .
" after 10 years and having seen an uncompleted version of it , i 'm slightly nervous about it , " he said .
" i hope people like it .
i hope the rest of the world gets to see it . "
shortly after mr phillips died in 1996 , the british film institute recognised la charrette as the smallest cinema in wales .
over the years it has shown classics such as gone with the wind and the sound of music , as well as more recent films such as the queen and wild hogs .
la charrette 's farewell will feature in the culture show on bbc 2 on saturday , 1 march at 1900 gmt .
