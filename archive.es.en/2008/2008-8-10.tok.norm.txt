un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also talked with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . french , finnish fms head to region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner is enroute to tbilisi kouchner and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , on sunday meanwhile headed to georgia 's capital tbilisi and moscow in a bid to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire in the south ossetian conflict .
stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .

kasabiev - set to compete on aug .
17 in the 94 kilogram discipline - and kuzilov - set to take part in the 105 kilogram competition a day later - have been in constant contact with their families in recent days , team officials said .
" so far everything is fine , but we all spend all our time worrying , " georgian delegation spokesman giorgi tschanishvili told dpa news agency .
" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .
" a war is always something abnormal , but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse . "
it was duly noted around the world that the hostilities started during the opening ceremony with russian prime minister vladimir putin present in the beijing stadium .
staying at the games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic truce was not respected in georgia this year " it is very difficult for us georgians because of everything that is going on at home , " said shooting bronze medalist nino salukvadze .
" last night the president -lrb- mikheil saakashvili -rrb- called and told us we better stay in beijing .
we could n't sleep all night .
we were up until one or two in the morning .
all we could think about was georgia . "
salukvadze and silver medalist natalia paderina of russia hugged and kissed in a poignant gesture of olympic sportsmanship after the victory ceremony on sunday .
" the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship , " salukvadze said .
" we have had so many big wars in the 20th century , what we need is peace .
that is something politics can learn from sport . "
paderina said : " i have won many friends through sport .
not only in russia but in many other countries .
nino competed for the soviet union for many years .
we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport . "
old friends russian mission spokesman gennady shvets told dpa that the gesture reflects a long tradition of friendliness from russian athletes and that sportsmen are not thinking of armed conflict .
" for us , there is no georgian issue , it 's just georgian athletes , " shvets stressed .
within the russian ranks , the war is virtually taboo , and the athletes are not thinking of armed conflict .
" they are all thinking only of the olympic games and of how to win medals , gold , silver or bronze , " shvets said .

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?

well i think we see that a lot today .

i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?
that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kasabiev - set to compete on aug .

" so far everything is fine , but we all spend all our time worrying , " georgian delegation spokesman giorgi tschanishvili told dpa news agency .
" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .
" a war is always something abnormal , but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse . "
it was duly noted around the world that the hostilities started during the opening ceremony with russian prime minister vladimir putin present in the beijing stadium .

all we could think about was georgia . "
salukvadze and silver medalist natalia paderina of russia hugged and kissed in a poignant gesture of olympic sportsmanship after the victory ceremony on sunday .
" the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship , " salukvadze said .
" we have had so many big wars in the 20th century , what we need is peace .
that is something politics can learn from sport . "
paderina said : " i have won many friends through sport .
not only in russia but in many other countries .
nino competed for the soviet union for many years .
we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport . "
old friends russian mission spokesman gennady shvets told dpa that the gesture reflects a long tradition of friendliness from russian athletes and that sportsmen are not thinking of armed conflict .
" for us , there is no georgian issue , it 's just georgian athletes , " shvets stressed .
within the russian ranks , the war is virtually taboo , and the athletes are not thinking of armed conflict .

" we spent three days in a bunker with no lights , no gas , no water .
we have only the clothes on our backs . " workers for russia 's migration services passed out sandwiches and water to outstretched hands after flagging the minivan down at one of three checkpoints along the lone road feeding from south ossetia to russia . the war between russia and georgia had expanded on saturday , adding to the flow of refugees from south ossetia , which allied itself with russia after declaring itself independent from georgia in the 1990s .
georgia has sought to maintain control of the territory . the fiercest battles on saturday were in the south ossetian city of tskhinvali , where intense howitzer and tank fire in the vicinity of the town was audible .
shelling intensified in the early afternoon , as russian reinforcements arriving on the scene went on the counteroffensive . refugees fleeing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia mobilized its reserves on saturday the united nations high commissioner for refugees representative in tbilisi said friday that more than 2,000 refugees had fled across the border into russia , and thousands more likely made their way across the pass saturday . no fewer than 400 vehicles , including tanks , armored personnel carriers , military transport carriers and mobile anti-aircraft guns , formed a russian military convoy headed the opposite direction on saturday to join the fighting . relatives of those caught in south ossetia since the start of fighting huddled in groups watching the colonnade , and raising a cheer when four russian attack helicopters blazed overhead toward the mountains . but lida gabarayeva , 47 , broke into tears as another minivan of refugees arrived with no sign of her 5th-grade niece , left in the care of friends for summer vacation in tskhinvali before the fighting broke out thursday . " i thought they might be with them ...
if they 're still alive , " she said . gabarayeva traveled to the border friday night in an attempt to retrieve the 9-year-old girl .

" but they 've also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave . " a car of five young south ossetian men had crossed paths with the russian military convoy , as the car made a run over the border from tskhinvali for food , one of the men , sergei , said saturday . " the stores are either on fire or empty , " he said .
" we 're heading back tonight , but we do n't know if we can get through . " on the other side of the four-kilometer , black tunnel , the road was under heavy fire .
a key bridge on the road from tskhinvali had been also been bombed , and heavy shelling kept women and children stuck in improvised bunkers , the refugees said . " now people ca n't get out -lrb- from tskhinvali -rrb- , even by foot , " said alik tomayeva , 41 , who has been shuttling people back-and-forth since the fighting broke out .
he said he would still try to get through to the capital via another mountain road . " we will never forget this , " toyeva 's sister said .

russan navy vessels meanwhile arrive at georgia 's black sea coast in what could become the next hotspot of the war . georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told afp news service on sunday , aug .
10 , that his country 's forces had " practically left " all of south ossetia " as an expression of good will and our willingness to stop military confrontation . " georgian and russian forces had exchanged artillery fire in the early hours of sunday , aug .
10 , south ossetia officials said , while russian planes bombed the runway of a military airfield near tbilisi international airport according to a georgian official . russia sending more soldiers , ships to georgian coast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow and tbilisi have been unable to agree on a ceasefire deal russian warships meanwhile arrived at the georgian black sea coast , according to news reports . " the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea , " a russian navy source was quoted as saying by russian news service interfax , reuters reported . the russian ships were blocking access to the port for ships carrying grain and fuel , lomaia told the afp .
he added that russian planes bombed a military airfield some five kilometers outside the capital tbilisi . georgia said a russian air raid had " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion " this was followed up with air raids on gori , the main georgian city closest to south ossetia .
apartment blocks in gori were left in flames and residents said scores of people were killed . georgia : " annihilation of a democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's offensive to take the enclave of south ossetia has been unsuccessful russian bombers also headed for the coast , georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili said saturday after air raids on the port of poti and the city of gori , where inhabitants said scores of people were killed . " what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict , it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders , " georgian president mikheil saakashvili said in an interview with the bbc . saakashvili declared a " state of war " on saturday but also offered a ceasefire to russia . but a meeting of the un security council on saturday failed to agree on a call for an immediate ceasefire .
russia 's ambassador to the un said moscow would not agree to a ceasefire until georgia removed all its troops from south ossetia . russian prime minister vladimir putin said moscow viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation , " and russia 's president dmitry medvedev said he would order an investigation of georgian crimes against civilians . us deputy ambassador alejandro wolff made it clear washington blamed russia for escalating the fighting . " this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control , " he said .
" the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces . " conflict widens to abkhazia fears of the conflict spreading added urgency to international calls for a ceasefire . the conflict spread to abkhazia , another breakaway region of georgia , where the separatist government said its forces had launched attacks on georgian troops .

" so far everything is fine , but we all spend all our time worrying , " georgian delegation spokesman giorgi tschanishvili told dpa news agency .
" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .

we were up until one or two in the morning .
all we could think about was georgia . "
salukvadze and silver medalist natalia paderina of russia hugged and kissed in a poignant gesture of olympic sportsmanship after the victory ceremony on sunday .
" the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship , " salukvadze said .
" we have had so many big wars in the 20th century , what we need is peace .
that is something politics can learn from sport . "
paderina said : " i have won many friends through sport .
not only in russia but in many other countries .
nino competed for the soviet union for many years .
we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport . "
old friends russian mission spokesman gennady shvets told dpa that the gesture reflects a long tradition of friendliness from russian athletes and that sportsmen are not thinking of armed conflict .
" for us , there is no georgian issue , it 's just georgian athletes , " shvets stressed .
within the russian ranks , the war is virtually taboo , and the athletes are not thinking of armed conflict .
" they are all thinking only of the olympic games and of how to win medals , gold , silver or bronze , " shvets said .

" also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .

volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kasabiev - set to compete on aug .
17 in the 94 kilogram discipline - and kuzilov - set to take part in the 105 kilogram competition a day later - have been in constant contact with their families in recent days , team officials said .
" so far everything is fine , but we all spend all our time worrying , " georgian delegation spokesman giorgi tschanishvili told dpa news agency .
" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .
" a war is always something abnormal , but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse . "
it was duly noted around the world that the hostilities started during the opening ceremony with russian prime minister vladimir putin present in the beijing stadium .
staying at the games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic truce was not respected in georgia this year " it is very difficult for us georgians because of everything that is going on at home , " said shooting bronze medalist nino salukvadze .

we could n't sleep all night .
we were up until one or two in the morning .
all we could think about was georgia . "
salukvadze and silver medalist natalia paderina of russia hugged and kissed in a poignant gesture of olympic sportsmanship after the victory ceremony on sunday .
" the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship , " salukvadze said .
" we have had so many big wars in the 20th century , what we need is peace .
that is something politics can learn from sport . "
paderina said : " i have won many friends through sport .
not only in russia but in many other countries .
nino competed for the soviet union for many years .
we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 10.08.2008 doping epidemic in society says former gdr athlete großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines geipel is wary of the consequences doping could have on society .
amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?
that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 10.08.2008 doping epidemic in society says former gdr athlete großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines geipel is wary of the consequences doping could have on society .
amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?
that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .
he also talked with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . french , finnish fms head to region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner is enroute to tbilisi kouchner and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , on sunday meanwhile headed to georgia 's capital tbilisi and moscow in a bid to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire in the south ossetian conflict .
stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions .

volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together .

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're hungry , " marina toyeva , 32 , told the dpa news agency , clutching her 8-year-old son and niece during a stop in the village of mizur , some 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- into russia from the south ossetian border .
" we spent three days in a bunker with no lights , no gas , no water .
we have only the clothes on our backs . " workers for russia 's migration services passed out sandwiches and water to outstretched hands after flagging the minivan down at one of three checkpoints along the lone road feeding from south ossetia to russia . the war between russia and georgia had expanded on saturday , adding to the flow of refugees from south ossetia , which allied itself with russia after declaring itself independent from georgia in the 1990s .
georgia has sought to maintain control of the territory . the fiercest battles on saturday were in the south ossetian city of tskhinvali , where intense howitzer and tank fire in the vicinity of the town was audible .
shelling intensified in the early afternoon , as russian reinforcements arriving on the scene went on the counteroffensive . refugees fleeing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia mobilized its reserves on saturday the united nations high commissioner for refugees representative in tbilisi said friday that more than 2,000 refugees had fled across the border into russia , and thousands more likely made their way across the pass saturday . no fewer than 400 vehicles , including tanks , armored personnel carriers , military transport carriers and mobile anti-aircraft guns , formed a russian military convoy headed the opposite direction on saturday to join the fighting . relatives of those caught in south ossetia since the start of fighting huddled in groups watching the colonnade , and raising a cheer when four russian attack helicopters blazed overhead toward the mountains . but lida gabarayeva , 47 , broke into tears as another minivan of refugees arrived with no sign of her 5th-grade niece , left in the care of friends for summer vacation in tskhinvali before the fighting broke out thursday . " i thought they might be with them ...
if they 're still alive , " she said . gabarayeva traveled to the border friday night in an attempt to retrieve the 9-year-old girl .
but her niece , a citizen of georgia , was n't allowed through , she said standing helpless at the road side , her voice drowned out by the rumble of passing tanks . empty shelves , lack of food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians are unsure what may await them at home " our husbands are not being let out - even the old men , " one refugee zamira , 36 , said , holding her elderly mother 's hand in the back of the freshly arrived van .
" but they 've also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave . " a car of five young south ossetian men had crossed paths with the russian military convoy , as the car made a run over the border from tskhinvali for food , one of the men , sergei , said saturday . " the stores are either on fire or empty , " he said .
" we 're heading back tonight , but we do n't know if we can get through . " on the other side of the four-kilometer , black tunnel , the road was under heavy fire .
a key bridge on the road from tskhinvali had been also been bombed , and heavy shelling kept women and children stuck in improvised bunkers , the refugees said . " now people ca n't get out -lrb- from tskhinvali -rrb- , even by foot , " said alik tomayeva , 41 , who has been shuttling people back-and-forth since the fighting broke out .
he said he would still try to get through to the capital via another mountain road . " we will never forget this , " toyeva 's sister said .
" there are no words for what we lived through .
that such things could happen in the year 2008 , i never thought was possible . " dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgia has sought to maintain control of the territory . the fiercest battles on saturday were in the south ossetian city of tskhinvali , where intense howitzer and tank fire in the vicinity of the town was audible .

" we 're hungry , " marina toyeva , 32 , told the dpa news agency , clutching her 8-year-old son and niece during a stop in the village of mizur , some 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- into russia from the south ossetian border .
" we spent three days in a bunker with no lights , no gas , no water .
we have only the clothes on our backs . " workers for russia 's migration services passed out sandwiches and water to outstretched hands after flagging the minivan down at one of three checkpoints along the lone road feeding from south ossetia to russia . the war between russia and georgia had expanded on saturday , adding to the flow of refugees from south ossetia , which allied itself with russia after declaring itself independent from georgia in the 1990s .
georgia has sought to maintain control of the territory . the fiercest battles on saturday were in the south ossetian city of tskhinvali , where intense howitzer and tank fire in the vicinity of the town was audible .
shelling intensified in the early afternoon , as russian reinforcements arriving on the scene went on the counteroffensive . refugees fleeing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia mobilized its reserves on saturday the united nations high commissioner for refugees representative in tbilisi said friday that more than 2,000 refugees had fled across the border into russia , and thousands more likely made their way across the pass saturday . no fewer than 400 vehicles , including tanks , armored personnel carriers , military transport carriers and mobile anti-aircraft guns , formed a russian military convoy headed the opposite direction on saturday to join the fighting . relatives of those caught in south ossetia since the start of fighting huddled in groups watching the colonnade , and raising a cheer when four russian attack helicopters blazed overhead toward the mountains . but lida gabarayeva , 47 , broke into tears as another minivan of refugees arrived with no sign of her 5th-grade niece , left in the care of friends for summer vacation in tskhinvali before the fighting broke out thursday . " i thought they might be with them ...
if they 're still alive , " she said . gabarayeva traveled to the border friday night in an attempt to retrieve the 9-year-old girl .
but her niece , a citizen of georgia , was n't allowed through , she said standing helpless at the road side , her voice drowned out by the rumble of passing tanks . empty shelves , lack of food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians are unsure what may await them at home " our husbands are not being let out - even the old men , " one refugee zamira , 36 , said , holding her elderly mother 's hand in the back of the freshly arrived van .
" but they 've also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave . " a car of five young south ossetian men had crossed paths with the russian military convoy , as the car made a run over the border from tskhinvali for food , one of the men , sergei , said saturday . " the stores are either on fire or empty , " he said .
" we 're heading back tonight , but we do n't know if we can get through . " on the other side of the four-kilometer , black tunnel , the road was under heavy fire .
a key bridge on the road from tskhinvali had been also been bombed , and heavy shelling kept women and children stuck in improvised bunkers , the refugees said . " now people ca n't get out -lrb- from tskhinvali -rrb- , even by foot , " said alik tomayeva , 41 , who has been shuttling people back-and-forth since the fighting broke out .
he said he would still try to get through to the capital via another mountain road . " we will never forget this , " toyeva 's sister said .

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .

" we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .

shelling intensified in the early afternoon , as russian reinforcements arriving on the scene went on the counteroffensive . refugees fleeing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia mobilized its reserves on saturday the united nations high commissioner for refugees representative in tbilisi said friday that more than 2,000 refugees had fled across the border into russia , and thousands more likely made their way across the pass saturday . no fewer than 400 vehicles , including tanks , armored personnel carriers , military transport carriers and mobile anti-aircraft guns , formed a russian military convoy headed the opposite direction on saturday to join the fighting . relatives of those caught in south ossetia since the start of fighting huddled in groups watching the colonnade , and raising a cheer when four russian attack helicopters blazed overhead toward the mountains . but lida gabarayeva , 47 , broke into tears as another minivan of refugees arrived with no sign of her 5th-grade niece , left in the care of friends for summer vacation in tskhinvali before the fighting broke out thursday . " i thought they might be with them ...
if they 're still alive , " she said . gabarayeva traveled to the border friday night in an attempt to retrieve the 9-year-old girl .
but her niece , a citizen of georgia , was n't allowed through , she said standing helpless at the road side , her voice drowned out by the rumble of passing tanks . empty shelves , lack of food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians are unsure what may await them at home " our husbands are not being let out - even the old men , " one refugee zamira , 36 , said , holding her elderly mother 's hand in the back of the freshly arrived van .
" but they 've also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave . " a car of five young south ossetian men had crossed paths with the russian military convoy , as the car made a run over the border from tskhinvali for food , one of the men , sergei , said saturday . " the stores are either on fire or empty , " he said .
" we 're heading back tonight , but we do n't know if we can get through . " on the other side of the four-kilometer , black tunnel , the road was under heavy fire .
a key bridge on the road from tskhinvali had been also been bombed , and heavy shelling kept women and children stuck in improvised bunkers , the refugees said . " now people ca n't get out -lrb- from tskhinvali -rrb- , even by foot , " said alik tomayeva , 41 , who has been shuttling people back-and-forth since the fighting broke out .
he said he would still try to get through to the capital via another mountain road . " we will never forget this , " toyeva 's sister said .
" there are no words for what we lived through .
that such things could happen in the year 2008 , i never thought was possible . " dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?
that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 10.08.2008 doping epidemic in society says former gdr athlete großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines geipel is wary of the consequences doping could have on society .
amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?
that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kasabiev - set to compete on aug .
17 in the 94 kilogram discipline - and kuzilov - set to take part in the 105 kilogram competition a day later - have been in constant contact with their families in recent days , team officials said .
" so far everything is fine , but we all spend all our time worrying , " georgian delegation spokesman giorgi tschanishvili told dpa news agency .
" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .
" a war is always something abnormal , but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse . "
it was duly noted around the world that the hostilities started during the opening ceremony with russian prime minister vladimir putin present in the beijing stadium .
staying at the games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic truce was not respected in georgia this year " it is very difficult for us georgians because of everything that is going on at home , " said shooting bronze medalist nino salukvadze .
" last night the president -lrb- mikheil saakashvili -rrb- called and told us we better stay in beijing .
we could n't sleep all night .
we were up until one or two in the morning .
all we could think about was georgia . "
salukvadze and silver medalist natalia paderina of russia hugged and kissed in a poignant gesture of olympic sportsmanship after the victory ceremony on sunday .
" the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship , " salukvadze said .
" we have had so many big wars in the 20th century , what we need is peace .
that is something politics can learn from sport . "
paderina said : " i have won many friends through sport .
not only in russia but in many other countries .
nino competed for the soviet union for many years .
we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport . "
old friends russian mission spokesman gennady shvets told dpa that the gesture reflects a long tradition of friendliness from russian athletes and that sportsmen are not thinking of armed conflict .
" for us , there is no georgian issue , it 's just georgian athletes , " shvets stressed .
within the russian ranks , the war is virtually taboo , and the athletes are not thinking of armed conflict .
" they are all thinking only of the olympic games and of how to win medals , gold , silver or bronze , " shvets said .
" wars or tsunamis do not matter in these two weeks . " dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together . " we ca n't rely on the americans fixing this yet again , " rahr said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .
he also talked with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . french , finnish fms head to region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner is enroute to tbilisi kouchner and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , on sunday meanwhile headed to georgia 's capital tbilisi and moscow in a bid to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire in the south ossetian conflict .
stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?
that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together .

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .
he also talked with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . french , finnish fms head to region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner is enroute to tbilisi kouchner and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , on sunday meanwhile headed to georgia 's capital tbilisi and moscow in a bid to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire in the south ossetian conflict .
stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that russian planes bombed a military airfield some five kilometers outside the capital tbilisi . georgia said a russian air raid had " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion " this was followed up with air raids on gori , the main georgian city closest to south ossetia .

russia 's ambassador to the un said moscow would not agree to a ceasefire until georgia removed all its troops from south ossetia . russian prime minister vladimir putin said moscow viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation , " and russia 's president dmitry medvedev said he would order an investigation of georgian crimes against civilians . us deputy ambassador alejandro wolff made it clear washington blamed russia for escalating the fighting .

georgian figures ranged from 82 dead , including 37 civilians , to a total of some 130 dead . south ossetia broke from georgia in the early 1990s .
it has been a constant source of friction between georgia and russia , which opposes tbilisi 's aspirations of joining nato and has supported the separatists without recognizing their independence . russia backs the separatist government in south ossetia and sent in tanks and troops on friday in response to pro-western georgia 's military offensive to take back the province which broke away in the early 1990s after a separatist war . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so far everything is fine , but we all spend all our time worrying , " georgian delegation spokesman giorgi tschanishvili told dpa news agency .
" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .
" a war is always something abnormal , but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse . "

" we have had so many big wars in the 20th century , what we need is peace .
that is something politics can learn from sport . "

we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport . "

" for us , there is no georgian issue , it 's just georgian athletes , " shvets stressed .

" they are all thinking only of the olympic games and of how to win medals , gold , silver or bronze , " shvets said .

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together .

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kasabiev - set to compete on aug .
17 in the 94 kilogram discipline - and kuzilov - set to take part in the 105 kilogram competition a day later - have been in constant contact with their families in recent days , team officials said .
" so far everything is fine , but we all spend all our time worrying , " georgian delegation spokesman giorgi tschanishvili told dpa news agency .
" the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games ' opening ceremony , " he said .
" a war is always something abnormal , but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse . "
it was duly noted around the world that the hostilities started during the opening ceremony with russian prime minister vladimir putin present in the beijing stadium .
staying at the games bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic truce was not respected in georgia this year " it is very difficult for us georgians because of everything that is going on at home , " said shooting bronze medalist nino salukvadze .

we could n't sleep all night .
we were up until one or two in the morning .
all we could think about was georgia . "
salukvadze and silver medalist natalia paderina of russia hugged and kissed in a poignant gesture of olympic sportsmanship after the victory ceremony on sunday .
" the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship , " salukvadze said .
" we have had so many big wars in the 20th century , what we need is peace .
that is something politics can learn from sport . "
paderina said : " i have won many friends through sport .
not only in russia but in many other countries .
nino competed for the soviet union for many years .
we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport . "
old friends russian mission spokesman gennady shvets told dpa that the gesture reflects a long tradition of friendliness from russian athletes and that sportsmen are not thinking of armed conflict .
" for us , there is no georgian issue , it 's just georgian athletes , " shvets stressed .
within the russian ranks , the war is virtually taboo , and the athletes are not thinking of armed conflict .
" they are all thinking only of the olympic games and of how to win medals , gold , silver or bronze , " shvets said .

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .
he also talked with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . french , finnish fms head to region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner is enroute to tbilisi kouchner and his finnish counterpart , alexander stubb , on sunday meanwhile headed to georgia 's capital tbilisi and moscow in a bid to get the two sides to agree to a ceasefire in the south ossetian conflict .
stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 10.08.2008 doping epidemic in society says former gdr athlete großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ines geipel is wary of the consequences doping could have on society .
amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?

well i think we see that a lot today .

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .

why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping does not only affect professional athletes .
society stands under enormous pressure of success , in all fields .
in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .
i 've observed that precisely amongst young people there is a strong group of people who say " i 'm not even going to take an aspirin because i do n't need it , because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them . "
peter sloterdijk speaks of a symphony of inner drugs which we can move ourselves around .
so it also has something to do with the variety of internal landscapes that we can discover and explore .
that would really be quite similar - with chemicals we are making use of the simplest kind of potential .
it is probably also important to realize that we are only human and as humans we also have diverse human weaknesses .
that is the most wonderful thing and the problem of all these chemicals is of course a problem of the ever stronger conformity that 's reaching out , the notion that " that is the perfect body " - but it is a body controlled by chemicals .
and it is quite clear that we are casting off a fundamental responsibility , especially when we take into account the problem of genetic doping and gene therapy , in other words everything that 's currently in the pharmaceutical pipeline .
if you consider this gene therapy then it 's really the children that will be transformed and we have the responsibility , which means we really must ask ourselves , can we then hold on to it ?
can we hold on to this responsibility ?
and i can only remind you again , certainly from my own experience , the consequences of this whole chemicalization are immense .
as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .
among your colleagues that took part in it back then , are there any who are now bringing out studies where they ask , " what has become of me through doping ? "
well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .
from these trials we know much more about the after-effects and side-effects of masculine steroids and fundamentally it is a shifting of gender , a virilization of women .
at this point i would also like to say that - and i know the story well - it is a real survival program for women to come back in life , because these masculine steroids also alter the brain of course .
they cause neural damage to the brain and that means definite and almost always extreme addiction sickness .
so we have a real collection of dangers here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has competition been made redundant ?
as the olympic games are now beginning in beijing , we can almost take for granted that cases of doping will emerge .
how far does that detract from the achievements that are made ?
how great is the enthusiasm for even faster , even higher , even further ?
well i think we see that a lot today .
on the one hand you have the tainted image of sport , but on the other hand the audience ratings will still be very high , so we are training with bigotry .
so there even comes a time where one gets used to this doping .
with the tour de france there is always a scandal around an individual athlete , but the system itself is never really taken into account , not to mention somehow changed .
i find this fatal because doping fundamentally means another damaged life and we get used to this trauma of sport .
i ca n't really get over that and i will struggle against that as long as i can because that does n't only make the idea of sport redundant , but also the competition .
in my eyes , a game that fundamentally exists outside of the rules will always be worthless and i seem to sense that fans are becoming a bit weary of the doping discussion .
but on the other hand i say that this is getting out of hand and where are the controls that can really work against it ?
that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in my book i 've tried to piece it together a bit .
firstly , of course , there are the studies .
even when you just take these fitness studios , over one million people in germany take growth hormones and steroids in gyms .
of course , this always has severe after-effects and side-effects and curiously we do not take that into account in the bigger picture .
no , we want to be in front , we want to be up there , we want to have muscular bodies and quick minds .
so we push ourselves further with all these chemicals and that , of course , has something to do with the fact that we do n't take into account our limits .
but in that lies the good fortune that we do have limits .
let 's just go back to sport for a minute and again the example of the bodybuilder .
is there the eventual desire to chase an ideal image that one could otherwise never reach … is it somehow sexy to look so muscular ?
well yes , i think you 're really onto it - and i 've also tried to show that in my book - this strong osmosis between sport and society .
the thing is in sport , in this celebrity-culture it 's exactly that muscular image that is being shown in the media and that will of course always influence someone 's idea of what looks good .
someone with a maybe not so well-developed sense of self then leaps after this muscular image and the fact that this affects millions is actually quite alarming .
this trend that now reigns in society , who actually pursues it ?
i 've just been talking about bodybuilders and students .
who else goes in for it ?
yes well , we really have to realize the situation and the realization is taking shape more and more that this problem has really stuck its claws into our society .
you could take a high-level orchestra and there will be doping there .
you could go to building sites .
i 've just been to a prison in butzbach where i had a session with murderers .
the kinds of bodies i saw - i would also see this psychologically : it 's a male system where you have to be accepted .
this problem really begins , of course , with children at school and leads to ritalin , modafinil and prozac at university .
so it 's really quite epidemic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the ideal body ?
can one then truthfully say that it is the weaker members of society who reach out to such means ?
no .
i believe that this doping problem is definitely partially socially conditioned , but then one must ask why .
why do i need a strong body , why do i need a styled body ?
and then we have the doping phenomenon in the media , we see it in top managers and so on .
and one can not say that these are the weaker groups in society .
so how can a society transform itself when weaknesses are less and less acceptable ?
well when you consider that in the us at the moment there is extensive research into things such as developing an anti-pain pill that lasts over four weeks - that means we could slip into a society that no longer knows pain .
what does that mean ?
on the one hand that will raise the potential for aggression unbelievably high .
so then society has less inhibitions , then you have to think twice about going out onto the street .
at the same time , of course , it goes all ways .
on the other hand we could really dampen society and , with similar effects to alcohol , at the same time make it more aggressive .
so what you want to see at a certain moment always depends highly on which door you open .
is there any kind of opposition movement that takes on exactly these points , that is against doping in society ?
absolutely .
in fact we can also see , through similar strong trends - social trends - that there are always alert and fundamentally strong individuals who say that all of that brings nothing .
there is no good kind of doping , there are only side-effects and after-effects .
especially all this " brain-doping , " that is all the doping that affects the brain , naturally causes big problems .
i am really astonished that there are hospitals that are reticent in germany , that the church is no longer raising the alarm .

as you just mentioned , you were a top athlete in the former gdr and there forced doping was quite normal .

well i wrote a book after the last berlin doping trial .
that was the biggest ever doping trial in germany , where the damage suffered by women who took masculine steroids in the time of the gdr - that was the main substance - really came out into the open .
that included involuntary sex change , cancer , disabled children - so even problems in the second generation - massive hormonal imbalance and so on .

amid doping concerns at the beijing olympics , deutsche welle spoke to anti-doping campaigner ines geipel , once track-and-field athletics world record holder of east germany . deutsche welle : miss geipel , if i ca n't quite make it on the track without a coffee in the morning , is that also a kind of doping ?
ines geipel : well yes , one can use that word in a very inflated way .
i do n't begrudge you your coffee and moreover what do i know ?
what other little tricks of stimulation are out there ?
by doping , of course , we 're already really talking about another kind of competition that does come into that , yes .
in society at the moment that is indeed the case , like with people who go to the gym in their free time .
they would actually really like to look a bit like arnold schwarzenegger and so they might also take a few substances .
then there are students who want to take something so that they 're not so agitated .
why are people always prepared to take such performance enhancing drugs in their daily lives ?

that comes into the factor that we need to finally remind the politicians , as well as the judicial authorities that are responsible , that we have got to set up clear defenses against this . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together .

russia 's ambassador to the un said moscow would not agree to a ceasefire until georgia removed all its troops from south ossetia . russian prime minister vladimir putin said moscow viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation , " and russia 's president dmitry medvedev said he would order an investigation of georgian crimes against civilians . us deputy ambassador alejandro wolff made it clear washington blamed russia for escalating the fighting .

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .

stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .

stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we spent three days in a bunker with no lights , no gas , no water .
we have only the clothes on our backs . " workers for russia 's migration services passed out sandwiches and water to outstretched hands after flagging the minivan down at one of three checkpoints along the lone road feeding from south ossetia to russia . the war between russia and georgia had expanded on saturday , adding to the flow of refugees from south ossetia , which allied itself with russia after declaring itself independent from georgia in the 1990s .
georgia has sought to maintain control of the territory . the fiercest battles on saturday were in the south ossetian city of tskhinvali , where intense howitzer and tank fire in the vicinity of the town was audible .
shelling intensified in the early afternoon , as russian reinforcements arriving on the scene went on the counteroffensive . refugees fleeing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia mobilized its reserves on saturday the united nations high commissioner for refugees representative in tbilisi said friday that more than 2,000 refugees had fled across the border into russia , and thousands more likely made their way across the pass saturday . no fewer than 400 vehicles , including tanks , armored personnel carriers , military transport carriers and mobile anti-aircraft guns , formed a russian military convoy headed the opposite direction on saturday to join the fighting . relatives of those caught in south ossetia since the start of fighting huddled in groups watching the colonnade , and raising a cheer when four russian attack helicopters blazed overhead toward the mountains . but lida gabarayeva , 47 , broke into tears as another minivan of refugees arrived with no sign of her 5th-grade niece , left in the care of friends for summer vacation in tskhinvali before the fighting broke out thursday . " i thought they might be with them ...
if they 're still alive , " she said . gabarayeva traveled to the border friday night in an attempt to retrieve the 9-year-old girl .
but her niece , a citizen of georgia , was n't allowed through , she said standing helpless at the road side , her voice drowned out by the rumble of passing tanks . empty shelves , lack of food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians are unsure what may await them at home " our husbands are not being let out - even the old men , " one refugee zamira , 36 , said , holding her elderly mother 's hand in the back of the freshly arrived van .
" but they 've also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave . " a car of five young south ossetian men had crossed paths with the russian military convoy , as the car made a run over the border from tskhinvali for food , one of the men , sergei , said saturday . " the stores are either on fire or empty , " he said .
" we 're heading back tonight , but we do n't know if we can get through . " on the other side of the four-kilometer , black tunnel , the road was under heavy fire .
a key bridge on the road from tskhinvali had been also been bombed , and heavy shelling kept women and children stuck in improvised bunkers , the refugees said .

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions .

volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're hungry , " marina toyeva , 32 , told the dpa news agency , clutching her 8-year-old son and niece during a stop in the village of mizur , some 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- into russia from the south ossetian border .
" we spent three days in a bunker with no lights , no gas , no water .
we have only the clothes on our backs . " workers for russia 's migration services passed out sandwiches and water to outstretched hands after flagging the minivan down at one of three checkpoints along the lone road feeding from south ossetia to russia . the war between russia and georgia had expanded on saturday , adding to the flow of refugees from south ossetia , which allied itself with russia after declaring itself independent from georgia in the 1990s .
georgia has sought to maintain control of the territory . the fiercest battles on saturday were in the south ossetian city of tskhinvali , where intense howitzer and tank fire in the vicinity of the town was audible .
shelling intensified in the early afternoon , as russian reinforcements arriving on the scene went on the counteroffensive . refugees fleeing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia mobilized its reserves on saturday the united nations high commissioner for refugees representative in tbilisi said friday that more than 2,000 refugees had fled across the border into russia , and thousands more likely made their way across the pass saturday . no fewer than 400 vehicles , including tanks , armored personnel carriers , military transport carriers and mobile anti-aircraft guns , formed a russian military convoy headed the opposite direction on saturday to join the fighting . relatives of those caught in south ossetia since the start of fighting huddled in groups watching the colonnade , and raising a cheer when four russian attack helicopters blazed overhead toward the mountains . but lida gabarayeva , 47 , broke into tears as another minivan of refugees arrived with no sign of her 5th-grade niece , left in the care of friends for summer vacation in tskhinvali before the fighting broke out thursday . " i thought they might be with them ...
if they 're still alive , " she said . gabarayeva traveled to the border friday night in an attempt to retrieve the 9-year-old girl .
but her niece , a citizen of georgia , was n't allowed through , she said standing helpless at the road side , her voice drowned out by the rumble of passing tanks . empty shelves , lack of food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians are unsure what may await them at home " our husbands are not being let out - even the old men , " one refugee zamira , 36 , said , holding her elderly mother 's hand in the back of the freshly arrived van .
" but they 've also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave . " a car of five young south ossetian men had crossed paths with the russian military convoy , as the car made a run over the border from tskhinvali for food , one of the men , sergei , said saturday . " the stores are either on fire or empty , " he said .
" we 're heading back tonight , but we do n't know if we can get through . " on the other side of the four-kilometer , black tunnel , the road was under heavy fire .
a key bridge on the road from tskhinvali had been also been bombed , and heavy shelling kept women and children stuck in improvised bunkers , the refugees said . " now people ca n't get out -lrb- from tskhinvali -rrb- , even by foot , " said alik tomayeva , 41 , who has been shuttling people back-and-forth since the fighting broke out .
he said he would still try to get through to the capital via another mountain road . " we will never forget this , " toyeva 's sister said .
" there are no words for what we lived through .
that such things could happen in the year 2008 , i never thought was possible . " dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un observers quit the gorge later in the day , according to rustaveli-2 and vesti-24 television reports . abkhazia mobilizes troops the war widened on saturday with abkhazia , like south ossetia a separatist georgian province supported by moscow , attacking georgian forces . abkhazia 's leader , sergei bagapsh , said on sunday he had sent 1,000 troops to the disputed kodori gorge and announced the mobilization of reservists to reinforce its positions , reuters news agency reported . " we are ready to act independently , " he told reporters .
" we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side . " david vs. goliath ? warships from russia 's black sea fleet by sunday morning had clamped down a naval blockade on georgia 's coastline , turning back " several civilian ships , " said aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , in a statement . bildunterschrift : among freighters halted with warning shots was a moldovan-flagged vessel carrying wheat to the port poti , threatening georgia 's food supplies , lomaia claimed . georgian intelligence gave the elements of the russian squadron as three amphibious assault vessels , two anti-submarine warfare vessels , a reconnaissance ship , two minesweepers , two missile boats , and a missile cruiser . the russian flotilla is substantially larger than georgia 's tiny navy , currently bottled up in poti . georgians relocate the site of the fiercest ground fighting over the last three days , the unofficial south ossetian capital tskhinvali , saw infantry battles throughout the night as russian forces engaged georgian troops holding heights overlooking the town . aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security council chief , called the retreat " a relocation to other positions . " heavy artillery fire on the city , a feature of fighting since the war 's outbreak , had practically halted by early sunday morning , according to a south ossetia army statement . us-russian conflict ? the international community has failed to produce any practical means towards reaching a ceasefire in the four-day-old conflict .
volodymyr ohryzko , ukraine 's foreign minister , flew into tbilisi on sunday morning .
his mission was to act , if possible , as an intermediary in dialogue between the russian and georgian government , according to a ukraine foreign ministry statement . russia 's government was by the weekend moving quickly towards establishing even tighter links with the south ossetia regime , with putin announcing moscow would spend a half billion dollars to rebuild tskhinvali , and provincial russian agencies offering aid to an estimated 34,000 refugees from the fighting . russia not only would provide the refugees food and shelter , but make sure that children now living in temporary housing or with relatives on the russian side of the border , would start their school year on time , putin said during a sunday visit to the russian city gorkiy . georgia on saturday said it was recalling a 2,000-man infantry brigade currently serving in iraq and accounted the georgian army 's most effective fighting force .
its return home would , however , be problematic , with a russian blockade likely to prevent shipment of the brigade 's heavy equipment home by sea , and the russian air force potentially able to intercept any passenger flight from iraq to georgia . georgian media reported that us aircraft might carry the georgian infantrymen home , placing washington and moscow on a collision course . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the secretary of georgia 's national security council , alexander lomaia , said sunday that russian forces had so far bombed 15 georgian cities . bildunterschrift : " we 're talking about total russian aggression - by land , air and sea , " he said . merkel meanwhile told sarkozy that the german government would support any attempts by the french eu presidency to end the military conflict and seek a political solution . steinmeier gets involved german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday also began working actively towards a resolution of the conflict . according to foreign ministry officials , germany sees itself in a special position since the country heads the so-called un group of friends of the secretary general , which has been trying to cool tensions between moscow and tbilisi over the breakaway georgian republic of abkhazia .
steinmeier visited georgia , abkhazia and russia in july to present a three-step peace plan but received a muted reception . steinmeier has sent ambassador hans-dieter lucas , the the foreign ministry 's envoy for eastern europe , central asia and the caucasus , to tbilisi where he landed late saturday with representatives from the eu presidency and the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- . he has also made calls to his georgian and russian counterparts , urging both of them to start talking to each other directly to resolve the conflict .

stubb is traveling in his capacity as head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . a french foreign ministry spokesman said that kouchner would be in tbilisi later sunday , and would then likely travel on to moscow on monday . kouchner would make a plea for an immediate ceasefire and would offer humanitarian aid to the region , the ministry spokesman said . france has already demanded a pullout of georgian and russian forces , as well as for respect for georgia 's territorial integrity . an extraordinary meeting of the eu foreign ministers to discuss the conflict might take place wednesday in brussels , the spokesman said .
consultations were going on among eu capitals on setting a date for the meeting . polish fm for eu peace mission polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski on sunday came out in favor of a european union peace mission . the eu could be a good partner , because of its credibility in the eyes of both conflict parties , sikorski told warsaw 's tvn24 news broadcaster . the foreign minister saw the eu as a " less controversial " peacekeeper than the north atlantic treaty organization and more effective than the united nations . in talks with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , sikorski took it that the eu would be prepared to undertake such peacekeeping duties . until now , russia troops have been taking the duties of maintaining order in abkhazia and south ossetia . pope calls on both sides to remember shared heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has implored russians and georgians to remember their common christian heritage german-born pope benedict xvi on sunday meanwhile appealed to a " shared christian heritage " to implore all forces to end their fighting in georgia and its south ossetia province which he said , was causing " many innocent victims . " " it is my fervent hope that all military actions cease immediately , " benedict said . the pontiff made his appeal following his traditional sunday angelus prayer before a packed square in the italian north-eastern alpine town of bressanone , where he is currently on vacation . benedict was following with " deep anguish " the escalating conflict . " also in the name of a shared christian heritage , refrain from more clashes and from violent retaliation that can degenerate in a wider conflict , " benedict urged , adding that a resumption of peace talks was required . " together with our orthodox brethren , we pray intensely for these intentions , which we trustingly deliver to the intercession of the holiest virgin mary , mother of god and all christians , " benedict said . he was referring to the orthodox christian religion of most russians and georgians . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together .

" we 're hungry , " marina toyeva , 32 , told the dpa news agency , clutching her 8-year-old son and niece during a stop in the village of mizur , some 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- into russia from the south ossetian border .
" we spent three days in a bunker with no lights , no gas , no water .
we have only the clothes on our backs . " workers for russia 's migration services passed out sandwiches and water to outstretched hands after flagging the minivan down at one of three checkpoints along the lone road feeding from south ossetia to russia . the war between russia and georgia had expanded on saturday , adding to the flow of refugees from south ossetia , which allied itself with russia after declaring itself independent from georgia in the 1990s .
georgia has sought to maintain control of the territory . the fiercest battles on saturday were in the south ossetian city of tskhinvali , where intense howitzer and tank fire in the vicinity of the town was audible .
shelling intensified in the early afternoon , as russian reinforcements arriving on the scene went on the counteroffensive . refugees fleeing to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia mobilized its reserves on saturday the united nations high commissioner for refugees representative in tbilisi said friday that more than 2,000 refugees had fled across the border into russia , and thousands more likely made their way across the pass saturday . no fewer than 400 vehicles , including tanks , armored personnel carriers , military transport carriers and mobile anti-aircraft guns , formed a russian military convoy headed the opposite direction on saturday to join the fighting . relatives of those caught in south ossetia since the start of fighting huddled in groups watching the colonnade , and raising a cheer when four russian attack helicopters blazed overhead toward the mountains . but lida gabarayeva , 47 , broke into tears as another minivan of refugees arrived with no sign of her 5th-grade niece , left in the care of friends for summer vacation in tskhinvali before the fighting broke out thursday . " i thought they might be with them ...
if they 're still alive , " she said . gabarayeva traveled to the border friday night in an attempt to retrieve the 9-year-old girl .
but her niece , a citizen of georgia , was n't allowed through , she said standing helpless at the road side , her voice drowned out by the rumble of passing tanks . empty shelves , lack of food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetians are unsure what may await them at home " our husbands are not being let out - even the old men , " one refugee zamira , 36 , said , holding her elderly mother 's hand in the back of the freshly arrived van .
" but they 've also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave . " a car of five young south ossetian men had crossed paths with the russian military convoy , as the car made a run over the border from tskhinvali for food , one of the men , sergei , said saturday . " the stores are either on fire or empty , " he said .
" we 're heading back tonight , but we do n't know if we can get through . " on the other side of the four-kilometer , black tunnel , the road was under heavy fire .
a key bridge on the road from tskhinvali had been also been bombed , and heavy shelling kept women and children stuck in improvised bunkers , the refugees said . " now people ca n't get out -lrb- from tskhinvali -rrb- , even by foot , " said alik tomayeva , 41 , who has been shuttling people back-and-forth since the fighting broke out .
he said he would still try to get through to the capital via another mountain road . " we will never forget this , " toyeva 's sister said .

a german expert says they should focus on their potential as mediators - and not rely on us involvement . german leaders - many of them still on their summer vacation - have held back on long statements about the escalating war in the caucasus .
but the few voices that have been audible so far show that the country 's ruling grand coalition seems split on the question of who is to blame . in an interview with german mass-tabloid bild am sonntag on sunday , aug .
10 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an immediate ceasefire . " we face the danger of a dangerous conflagration , " he said , without identifying a culprit in the conflict . deputy fm : georgia violated international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler his deputy , gernot erler , who is also a social democrat , went a step further .
talking to german public broadcaster ndr info , erler said georgians had breached a 1992 ceasefire agreement struck with russia over south ossetia , monitored essentially by russian peacekeepers . " in this sense , it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action , " said erler , who is a social democrat like steinmeier . he acknowledged prior provocation of the georgian leadership from russian-backed south ossetia 's separatists , but said he understood russia 's reaction .
while south ossetia remains sovereign georgian territory , russia has taken over the role of providing economic support to the region , erler said .
from a russian perspective , peacekeeping troops have therefore been attacked . " it 's an insane , bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province , " he said . adding oil to the fire ? while other social democrats and members of the opposition green party have been critical of the georgian actions , germany 's conservatives are more inclined to blame russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eckart von klaeden eckart von klaeden , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and his party 's foreign policy spokesman in parliament , meanwhile said that russia was equality guilty fort he current escalation . " it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire , " klaeden told neue presse newspaper , adding that the kremlin had intentionally brought about the conflict by issuing russian passports to a majority of south ossetians . merkel herself is due to meet with russian president dmitry medvedev at the russian black sea resort of sochi , not far from the border with georgia 's breakaway region of abkhazia , on friday . europe 's energy supplies at stake german experts on russia , however , said that merkel and steinmeier would most likely work together to help resolve the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr " it would be stupid for them to block each other , " alexander rahr , a russia expert with the german council on foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told afp news agency .
" after all , this is about a strategic question , namely securing europe 's energy supplies . " rahr added that steinmeier 's connections to medvedev 's surroundings presented a great opportunity for him to act as a mediator in the conflict . but more than anything else , europeans - who have let the us play the biggest role in the region so far - would have to get active together .

" the world just got a little less funny , " said the star , who appeared with mac in the ocean 's eleven series .
" this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie , " added don cheadle , another ocean 's co-star , " but heaven just got funnier . "
mac , who starred in his own tv show as well as a number of hollywood films , died of complications from pneumonia .
the chicago-born comedian , whose real name was bernard jeffrey mccullough , was admitted to hospital on 1 august .
but his death surprised many , as he had reportedly been responding well to treatment .
comedian carl reiner said he was " in utter shock " because he thought his friend 's condition had been improving .
" he was just so alive .
i ca n't believe he 's gone , " he added .
the comedian spent years as a stand-up before breaking into hollywood " i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac , " said samuel l jackson , who recently completed filming musical comedy soul men with the star .
" my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man . "
mac 's larger-than-life comedy persona was informed by his impoverished childhood in chicago and honed by years on the stand-up circuit .
he made his first film appearance in the damon wayans movie mo ' money in 1992 , but achieved mainstream success as part of the kings of comedy tour and tv special in 1997 .
a recurring role in sitcom moesha led to his own eponymous tv show , which picked up several emmy and golden globe nominations - and won the comedian a peabody award for excellence in television .
married for more than 30 years , mac largely eschewed hollywood , choosing to live in chicago .
he is survived by his wife , rhonda , a daughter and a granddaughter .

" the world just got a little less funny , " said the star , who appeared with mac in the ocean 's eleven series .
" this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie , " added don cheadle , another ocean 's co-star , " but heaven just got funnier . "
mac , who starred in his own tv show as well as a number of hollywood films , died of complications from pneumonia .
the chicago-born comedian , whose real name was bernard jeffrey mccullough , was admitted to hospital on 1 august .
but his death surprised many , as he had reportedly been responding well to treatment .
comedian carl reiner said he was " in utter shock " because he thought his friend 's condition had been improving .
" he was just so alive .
i ca n't believe he 's gone , " he added .
the comedian spent years as a stand-up before breaking into hollywood " i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac , " said samuel l jackson , who recently completed filming musical comedy soul men with the star .
" my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man . "
mac 's larger-than-life comedy persona was informed by his impoverished childhood in chicago and honed by years on the stand-up circuit .
he made his first film appearance in the damon wayans movie mo ' money in 1992 , but achieved mainstream success as part of the kings of comedy tour and tv special in 1997 .
a recurring role in sitcom moesha led to his own eponymous tv show , which picked up several emmy and golden globe nominations - and won the comedian a peabody award for excellence in television .
married for more than 30 years , mac largely eschewed hollywood , choosing to live in chicago .
he is survived by his wife , rhonda , a daughter and a granddaughter .
