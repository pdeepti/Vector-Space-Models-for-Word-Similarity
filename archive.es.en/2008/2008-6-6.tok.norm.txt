the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing . "
the text was " unfortunately very watered down with respect to the initial ambitions , " he said , according to the ansa news agency . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul meanwhile said that the conference was " an important programmatic impulse . " " the global food crisis has to remain on top of the agenda for the international community , " she said . short-term results wrangling over the document - in particular objections over its wording by argentina , venezuela and cuba - delayed its adoption until late in the evening , many hours later than expected . disagreements also remained over trade barriers , such as import tariffs and other taxes , and food export restrictions , with some countries opposing the easing or lifting of such measures . instead , the declaration committed its signatories to two immediate and short-term lines of action : to respond urgently to requests for assistance from hunger-threatened countries and to lend immediate support for agricultural production and trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick help is needed in countries like niger the summit host , the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , had listed 22 countries that are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of high levels of chronic hunger - defined as more than 30 percent undernourishment - and being net importers of both food and fuel . countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected . to help such food-importing , low-income countries cope with the high food prices , the declaration specified donors and international financial institutions should " provide , in a timely manner , balance of payment support . " not enough pledges the summit was more successful in winning donor emergency aid to counter the food crisis , with several billion dollars pledged .
major donors included france with $ 1.5 billion , the saudi arabia-based islamic development bank , with $ 1.5 billion , the african development bank with $ 1 billion , and the world bank with $ 1.2 billion . other pledges included $ 773 million by spain over four years , $ 100 million by kuwait and $ 100 million from venezuela . un secretary general ban ki-moon suggested at the start of the summit that some $ 20 billion a year was needed to tackle hunger and that world food and production must be doubled by 2030 .

a gray box site atop one of the hills .
workers from the netherlands , germany and italy have worked for the past six months to complete it .
in summer , canadian firm arise technologies will move in and begin to produce 1,500 solar cells per hour .
some level of improvisation 's still needed .
people are working on the roof of the giant aluminum hall while diggers are working on the ground outside .
but standing between construction containers , sjouke zijlstra , the plant 's dutch manager , is convinced that his company 's a beacon of hope for the town 's 13,000 residents .
" we 'll soon be the biggest shop in town , " he said .
limited jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant can still do with a touch of color to start with , the company needs 130 new employees , including 10 engineers .
it 's no wonder that the canadians received a warm welcome , considering that the town has an unemployment rate of 16 percent .
but zijlstra dampens too much enthusiasm by saying that the need for employees will remain limited .
" we have a highly automated production process , " the 62-year-old said .
some time will pass before regional suppliers profit from the solar cell plant and even then , mainly caterers , cleaning firms and craftsmen will find work there .
the first production line has already arrived and three more are expected to follow .
the lines will take up the entire length of the hall .
they 're fed gray , thing silicon plates that get turned into sparkling blue solar cells in the end .
the plates are cleaned and treated with chemicals in many steps that cost a lot of energy .
the plant will only cover a small portion of this with renewable energy from its own facilities on the roof .
" the amount of energy that we need is so large that we can not get it from just one facility , " zijlstra said while moving to the end of the line , where the quality of the solar cells is checked with light flashes that surround the blue discs .
sweetening the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for the first products the company did n't show up in bischofswerda out of the blue , though : german and eu subsidies did play an important role .
zijlstra said that the company gets subsidies of 50 percent - that 's 20 to 25 percent more than in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
" that 's a significant amount of money when you 're investing 50 million euros -lrb- $ 77.9 million -rrb- , " he said .
bischofswerda 's mayor , andreas erler , wooed investors for seven years before he managed to get them on board .

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .
the european commission , which proposed the plan last september , hopes that the move will end conflicts of interests that keep prices high and hold back investment .
giving the big guys a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big guys do n't want to give up their pipelines several eu countries , including france and germany , have introduced alternative ways to change the status quo after energy companies complained about the plan .
a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .
last week , fellow german energy group rwe proposed last week to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network in order to avoid a drawn-out anti-trust battle with the commission . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one group has now come up with a shocking way to deter potential clients . a young , frightened woman ends up as a prostitute after she 's auctioned off like cattle by a crowd of men , who wildly scream at each other - that 's the content of a video clip by the swiss campaign against trafficking in women during euro 2008 . the film will be broadcast on swiss television , in soccer stadiums and at public viewing events to shake up potential clients of prostitutes .
gaby vermot , who heads the campaign , said that the championships are a unique opportunity to educate people about forced prostitution . members of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality in the european parliament agree and have called for a broad-based societal initiative against forced prostitution ahead of the championships , which will take place in austria and switzerland starting saturday , june 7 . showing the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 500,000 women from eastern europe are forced prostitutes anna zaborska , a slovak conservative member of the european parliament , who heads the committee , said that a " red card for forced prostitution , " introduced during the world cup in germany in 2006 , should be revived during the current competition . lissy groener , a german social democratic committee member , said that the 2006 campaign had been successful . " two years ago , a large campaign made sure that the expected increase of forced prostitution was prevented , " she said . groener added that up to 800,000 women become victims of forced prostitution each year . " this is one of the most upsetting violation of human rights nowadays , " she said . double trouble more than half a million women from eastern europe alone are forced into prostitution each year , according to the committee .
groener said that the women are put in a difficult situation for two reasons : on the one hand , they 're illegal immigrants in the country that they 've been brought to .
on the other hand , they 're forced to prostitute themselves . " much more has to happen , " groener said , referring to more action taken by the eu commission .
at the same time , the campaign is not about pointing fingers at the host countries , she added . " as political mouth pieces for the affected women , we want to put a stop to this modern form of slavery , " she said . getting the facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything but glamorous christa prets , an austrian committee member , added that the campaign was also not interested in castigating soccer events . " it 's simply a fact that there 's more prostitution during soccer events and big events in general , " she said . committee members said that they do n't have any definitive figures on how much forced prostitution takes place during such events .

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers .

but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers . " fellmann added that it would be better for berlin to offer tax and other relief to farmers to leave the industry . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .

tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .
russia sees georgia 's bid for nato membership as an encroachment of its power in the region . georgia has negotiated with nato the possibility of joining the alliance , although a timeframe has not been laid down . medvedev rejects outside help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is staunchly opposed to georgia joining nato tensions have risen in recent weeks after georgia accused a russian fighter jet of shooting down one of its spy planes on april 20 .
tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .

according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .
germany look for smooth passage out of group b bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are preparing for thier campaign under wraps compared to the travails facing italy and france , tournament favorites germany should be in relaxed mood ahead of sunday 's group b encounter against poland in klagenfurt , especially as the group is completed by a poor austrian side and an injury-weakened croatia .
however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .
scolari mixed the two sides up in the second half as he continued his preparations for saturday 's group a opener against turkey .
swiss open tournament against czechs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei and co. have a tough opening game earlier in the day , the czech republic face switzerland .
veteran coach karel bruckner is another who believes privacy is necessary , banning the media from his side 's training sessions and holding his press conference at the team hotel in seefeld , austria , instead .
the 68-year-old said he already knew which was his preferred starting line-up and has no injury worries ahead of the swiss encounter .
tournament dark horses spain have to wait until next tuesday before taking on russia in the opening game in group d in innsbruck .
coach luis aragones has slight injury concerns over david villa and sergio garcia so omitted the pair from wednesday night 's final warm-up game against the united states .
thanks to a late goal from barcelona midfield xavi hernandez spain earned a 1-0 victory and spain now go to the tournament as europe 's form team , having won 16 and drawn two out of their last 18 games .
" we are most concerned about villa , " said team doctor jorge candel in santander .
" he took very hard knocks in training and see how things develop in the coming days . "
spainish hopes resting on young shoulders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain are hoping to put 44 years of hurt behind them villa is still expected to be fit to face guus hiddink 's russia while barcelona midfielder has joined up with the rest of the squad after undergoing treatment for food poisoning in a madrid clinic .
if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .
at least aragones can relax safe in the knowledge that the 24- year-old is willing to adapt his game for the cause .
" i am the one that needs to accustom myself to the way the team plays and not the other way round , " said torres .
" if this team is united and works as a unit , we can achieve great things . "
champions pursue further glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans had a lot to shout about four years ago defending champions greece complete group d and open their title defense against sweden on tuesday in salzburg .

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing . "
the text was " unfortunately very watered down with respect to the initial ambitions , " he said , according to the ansa news agency . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul meanwhile said that the conference was " an important programmatic impulse . " " the global food crisis has to remain on top of the agenda for the international community , " she said . short-term results wrangling over the document - in particular objections over its wording by argentina , venezuela and cuba - delayed its adoption until late in the evening , many hours later than expected . disagreements also remained over trade barriers , such as import tariffs and other taxes , and food export restrictions , with some countries opposing the easing or lifting of such measures . instead , the declaration committed its signatories to two immediate and short-term lines of action : to respond urgently to requests for assistance from hunger-threatened countries and to lend immediate support for agricultural production and trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick help is needed in countries like niger the summit host , the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , had listed 22 countries that are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of high levels of chronic hunger - defined as more than 30 percent undernourishment - and being net importers of both food and fuel . countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected . to help such food-importing , low-income countries cope with the high food prices , the declaration specified donors and international financial institutions should " provide , in a timely manner , balance of payment support . " not enough pledges the summit was more successful in winning donor emergency aid to counter the food crisis , with several billion dollars pledged .
major donors included france with $ 1.5 billion , the saudi arabia-based islamic development bank , with $ 1.5 billion , the african development bank with $ 1 billion , and the world bank with $ 1.2 billion . other pledges included $ 773 million by spain over four years , $ 100 million by kuwait and $ 100 million from venezuela . un secretary general ban ki-moon suggested at the start of the summit that some $ 20 billion a year was needed to tackle hunger and that world food and production must be doubled by 2030 .

a gray box site atop one of the hills .
workers from the netherlands , germany and italy have worked for the past six months to complete it .
in summer , canadian firm arise technologies will move in and begin to produce 1,500 solar cells per hour .
some level of improvisation 's still needed .
people are working on the roof of the giant aluminum hall while diggers are working on the ground outside .
but standing between construction containers , sjouke zijlstra , the plant 's dutch manager , is convinced that his company 's a beacon of hope for the town 's 13,000 residents .
" we 'll soon be the biggest shop in town , " he said .
limited jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant can still do with a touch of color to start with , the company needs 130 new employees , including 10 engineers .
it 's no wonder that the canadians received a warm welcome , considering that the town has an unemployment rate of 16 percent .

" we have a highly automated production process , " the 62-year-old said .

a gray box site atop one of the hills .
workers from the netherlands , germany and italy have worked for the past six months to complete it .
in summer , canadian firm arise technologies will move in and begin to produce 1,500 solar cells per hour .
some level of improvisation 's still needed .
people are working on the roof of the giant aluminum hall while diggers are working on the ground outside .
but standing between construction containers , sjouke zijlstra , the plant 's dutch manager , is convinced that his company 's a beacon of hope for the town 's 13,000 residents .
" we 'll soon be the biggest shop in town , " he said .
limited jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant can still do with a touch of color to start with , the company needs 130 new employees , including 10 engineers .
it 's no wonder that the canadians received a warm welcome , considering that the town has an unemployment rate of 16 percent .
but zijlstra dampens too much enthusiasm by saying that the need for employees will remain limited .
" we have a highly automated production process , " the 62-year-old said .
some time will pass before regional suppliers profit from the solar cell plant and even then , mainly caterers , cleaning firms and craftsmen will find work there .
the first production line has already arrived and three more are expected to follow .
the lines will take up the entire length of the hall .
they 're fed gray , thing silicon plates that get turned into sparkling blue solar cells in the end .
the plates are cleaned and treated with chemicals in many steps that cost a lot of energy .
the plant will only cover a small portion of this with renewable energy from its own facilities on the roof .
" the amount of energy that we need is so large that we can not get it from just one facility , " zijlstra said while moving to the end of the line , where the quality of the solar cells is checked with light flashes that surround the blue discs .
sweetening the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for the first products the company did n't show up in bischofswerda out of the blue , though : german and eu subsidies did play an important role .
zijlstra said that the company gets subsidies of 50 percent - that 's 20 to 25 percent more than in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
" that 's a significant amount of money when you 're investing 50 million euros -lrb- $ 77.9 million -rrb- , " he said .
bischofswerda 's mayor , andreas erler , wooed investors for seven years before he managed to get them on board .
erler said he believes that his town 's proximity to leading solar research centers such as the one at dresden 's technical university , were an important selling point for arise .
the canadian investors , meanwhile , are optimistic as far as bischofswerda and the future development of solar cells is concerned .
if everything goes according to plan , nine more production halls will be built in the future - and hopefully attract other companies as well .
" when one firm gets started , others will follow , " zijlstra said .
he might be right : two more companies interested in processing solar cells recently dropped by bischofswerda . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .
" each year we think that maybe this will be his last but he just seems to carry on regardless . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the unidentified perpetrators , believed to be right-wing extremists , demolished flower pots and the entrance door to the site , according to memorial officials . the suspects also tried unsuccessfully to smash in a security-glass window at the museum , which highlights the death march of inmates from sachsenhausen concentration camp during the last days of world war ii .
in april 1945 , some 33,000 inmates were forced to march north and many died along the way .
about 16,000 inmates were left in below forest , where the memorial is now located . it 's not the first attack on the memorial : in 2002 , an arson attack almost completely destroyed the museum , which is situated in a secluded location of the forest . " the new attack on the museum worries us greatly , " said guenter morsch , who heads the memorial sites in brandenburg .
the attack proved that memorial sites were still targets for neo-nazi attacks , he added . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one group has now come up with a shocking way to deter potential clients . a young , frightened woman ends up as a prostitute after she 's auctioned off like cattle by a crowd of men , who wildly scream at each other - that 's the content of a video clip by the swiss campaign against trafficking in women during euro 2008 . the film will be broadcast on swiss television , in soccer stadiums and at public viewing events to shake up potential clients of prostitutes .
gaby vermot , who heads the campaign , said that the championships are a unique opportunity to educate people about forced prostitution . members of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality in the european parliament agree and have called for a broad-based societal initiative against forced prostitution ahead of the championships , which will take place in austria and switzerland starting saturday , june 7 . showing the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 500,000 women from eastern europe are forced prostitutes anna zaborska , a slovak conservative member of the european parliament , who heads the committee , said that a " red card for forced prostitution , " introduced during the world cup in germany in 2006 , should be revived during the current competition . lissy groener , a german social democratic committee member , said that the 2006 campaign had been successful . " two years ago , a large campaign made sure that the expected increase of forced prostitution was prevented , " she said . groener added that up to 800,000 women become victims of forced prostitution each year . " this is one of the most upsetting violation of human rights nowadays , " she said . double trouble more than half a million women from eastern europe alone are forced into prostitution each year , according to the committee .
groener said that the women are put in a difficult situation for two reasons : on the one hand , they 're illegal immigrants in the country that they 've been brought to .
on the other hand , they 're forced to prostitute themselves . " much more has to happen , " groener said , referring to more action taken by the eu commission .
at the same time , the campaign is not about pointing fingers at the host countries , she added . " as political mouth pieces for the affected women , we want to put a stop to this modern form of slavery , " she said . getting the facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything but glamorous christa prets , an austrian committee member , added that the campaign was also not interested in castigating soccer events . " it 's simply a fact that there 's more prostitution during soccer events and big events in general , " she said . committee members said that they do n't have any definitive figures on how much forced prostitution takes place during such events .
that 's part of the problem , prets said , and called for more data collection . " we wo n't be able to register all prostitutes and all illegal sex workers , but it would be good to have a common european data collection system , " she said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .
" each year we think that maybe this will be his last but he just seems to carry on regardless . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.06.2008 russia rejects western help in abkhazia conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both georgia and russia lay claim to the abkhazia region russia warned georgia against joining nato , saying membership would only lead to more bloodshed in separatist abkhazia .
the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .
russia sees georgia 's bid for nato membership as an encroachment of its power in the region . georgia has negotiated with nato the possibility of joining the alliance , although a timeframe has not been laid down . medvedev rejects outside help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is staunchly opposed to georgia joining nato tensions have risen in recent weeks after georgia accused a russian fighter jet of shooting down one of its spy planes on april 20 .
tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .

solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing . "
the text was " unfortunately very watered down with respect to the initial ambitions , " he said , according to the ansa news agency . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul meanwhile said that the conference was " an important programmatic impulse .

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing .

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing . "
the text was " unfortunately very watered down with respect to the initial ambitions , " he said , according to the ansa news agency . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul meanwhile said that the conference was " an important programmatic impulse . " " the global food crisis has to remain on top of the agenda for the international community , " she said . short-term results wrangling over the document - in particular objections over its wording by argentina , venezuela and cuba - delayed its adoption until late in the evening , many hours later than expected . disagreements also remained over trade barriers , such as import tariffs and other taxes , and food export restrictions , with some countries opposing the easing or lifting of such measures . instead , the declaration committed its signatories to two immediate and short-term lines of action : to respond urgently to requests for assistance from hunger-threatened countries and to lend immediate support for agricultural production and trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick help is needed in countries like niger the summit host , the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , had listed 22 countries that are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of high levels of chronic hunger - defined as more than 30 percent undernourishment - and being net importers of both food and fuel . countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected . to help such food-importing , low-income countries cope with the high food prices , the declaration specified donors and international financial institutions should " provide , in a timely manner , balance of payment support . " not enough pledges the summit was more successful in winning donor emergency aid to counter the food crisis , with several billion dollars pledged .
major donors included france with $ 1.5 billion , the saudi arabia-based islamic development bank , with $ 1.5 billion , the african development bank with $ 1 billion , and the world bank with $ 1.2 billion . other pledges included $ 773 million by spain over four years , $ 100 million by kuwait and $ 100 million from venezuela . un secretary general ban ki-moon suggested at the start of the summit that some $ 20 billion a year was needed to tackle hunger and that world food and production must be doubled by 2030 .

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .

tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .
the european commission , which proposed the plan last september , hopes that the move will end conflicts of interests that keep prices high and hold back investment .
giving the big guys a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big guys do n't want to give up their pipelines several eu countries , including france and germany , have introduced alternative ways to change the status quo after energy companies complained about the plan .
a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .

a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .

however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .

" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .

about 16,000 inmates were left in below forest , where the memorial is now located . it 's not the first attack on the memorial : in 2002 , an arson attack almost completely destroyed the museum , which is situated in a secluded location of the forest .

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing . "
the text was " unfortunately very watered down with respect to the initial ambitions , " he said , according to the ansa news agency . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul meanwhile said that the conference was " an important programmatic impulse . " " the global food crisis has to remain on top of the agenda for the international community , " she said . short-term results wrangling over the document - in particular objections over its wording by argentina , venezuela and cuba - delayed its adoption until late in the evening , many hours later than expected . disagreements also remained over trade barriers , such as import tariffs and other taxes , and food export restrictions , with some countries opposing the easing or lifting of such measures . instead , the declaration committed its signatories to two immediate and short-term lines of action : to respond urgently to requests for assistance from hunger-threatened countries and to lend immediate support for agricultural production and trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick help is needed in countries like niger the summit host , the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , had listed 22 countries that are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of high levels of chronic hunger - defined as more than 30 percent undernourishment - and being net importers of both food and fuel . countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected . to help such food-importing , low-income countries cope with the high food prices , the declaration specified donors and international financial institutions should " provide , in a timely manner , balance of payment support . " not enough pledges the summit was more successful in winning donor emergency aid to counter the food crisis , with several billion dollars pledged .
major donors included france with $ 1.5 billion , the saudi arabia-based islamic development bank , with $ 1.5 billion , the african development bank with $ 1 billion , and the world bank with $ 1.2 billion . other pledges included $ 773 million by spain over four years , $ 100 million by kuwait and $ 100 million from venezuela . un secretary general ban ki-moon suggested at the start of the summit that some $ 20 billion a year was needed to tackle hunger and that world food and production must be doubled by 2030 .

current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .
germany look for smooth passage out of group b bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are preparing for thier campaign under wraps compared to the travails facing italy and france , tournament favorites germany should be in relaxed mood ahead of sunday 's group b encounter against poland in klagenfurt , especially as the group is completed by a poor austrian side and an injury-weakened croatia .
however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .
scolari mixed the two sides up in the second half as he continued his preparations for saturday 's group a opener against turkey .
swiss open tournament against czechs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei and co. have a tough opening game earlier in the day , the czech republic face switzerland .
veteran coach karel bruckner is another who believes privacy is necessary , banning the media from his side 's training sessions and holding his press conference at the team hotel in seefeld , austria , instead .
the 68-year-old said he already knew which was his preferred starting line-up and has no injury worries ahead of the swiss encounter .
tournament dark horses spain have to wait until next tuesday before taking on russia in the opening game in group d in innsbruck .
coach luis aragones has slight injury concerns over david villa and sergio garcia so omitted the pair from wednesday night 's final warm-up game against the united states .
thanks to a late goal from barcelona midfield xavi hernandez spain earned a 1-0 victory and spain now go to the tournament as europe 's form team , having won 16 and drawn two out of their last 18 games .
" we are most concerned about villa , " said team doctor jorge candel in santander .
" he took very hard knocks in training and see how things develop in the coming days . "
spainish hopes resting on young shoulders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain are hoping to put 44 years of hurt behind them villa is still expected to be fit to face guus hiddink 's russia while barcelona midfielder has joined up with the rest of the squad after undergoing treatment for food poisoning in a madrid clinic .
if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .
at least aragones can relax safe in the knowledge that the 24- year-old is willing to adapt his game for the cause .
" i am the one that needs to accustom myself to the way the team plays and not the other way round , " said torres .
" if this team is united and works as a unit , we can achieve great things . "
champions pursue further glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans had a lot to shout about four years ago defending champions greece complete group d and open their title defense against sweden on tuesday in salzburg .

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .
" each year we think that maybe this will be his last but he just seems to carry on regardless . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 06.06.2008 nazi compensation claims threaten german centers in italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distomo case has been dragging on for years if germany refuses to pay compensation to nazi victims in italy and greece , its cultural institutes in italy might face a levy of execution . the supreme court of cassation in rome has ruled that compensation claims brought by wartime italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis are legitimate .
the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .

solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .

tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers .

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the unidentified perpetrators , believed to be right-wing extremists , demolished flower pots and the entrance door to the site , according to memorial officials . the suspects also tried unsuccessfully to smash in a security-glass window at the museum , which highlights the death march of inmates from sachsenhausen concentration camp during the last days of world war ii .
in april 1945 , some 33,000 inmates were forced to march north and many died along the way .
about 16,000 inmates were left in below forest , where the memorial is now located . it 's not the first attack on the memorial : in 2002 , an arson attack almost completely destroyed the museum , which is situated in a secluded location of the forest . " the new attack on the museum worries us greatly , " said guenter morsch , who heads the memorial sites in brandenburg .
the attack proved that memorial sites were still targets for neo-nazi attacks , he added . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the unidentified perpetrators , believed to be right-wing extremists , demolished flower pots and the entrance door to the site , according to memorial officials . the suspects also tried unsuccessfully to smash in a security-glass window at the museum , which highlights the death march of inmates from sachsenhausen concentration camp during the last days of world war ii .
in april 1945 , some 33,000 inmates were forced to march north and many died along the way .
about 16,000 inmates were left in below forest , where the memorial is now located . it 's not the first attack on the memorial : in 2002 , an arson attack almost completely destroyed the museum , which is situated in a secluded location of the forest . " the new attack on the museum worries us greatly , " said guenter morsch , who heads the memorial sites in brandenburg .
the attack proved that memorial sites were still targets for neo-nazi attacks , he added . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing . "
the text was " unfortunately very watered down with respect to the initial ambitions , " he said , according to the ansa news agency . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul meanwhile said that the conference was " an important programmatic impulse . " " the global food crisis has to remain on top of the agenda for the international community , " she said . short-term results wrangling over the document - in particular objections over its wording by argentina , venezuela and cuba - delayed its adoption until late in the evening , many hours later than expected . disagreements also remained over trade barriers , such as import tariffs and other taxes , and food export restrictions , with some countries opposing the easing or lifting of such measures . instead , the declaration committed its signatories to two immediate and short-term lines of action : to respond urgently to requests for assistance from hunger-threatened countries and to lend immediate support for agricultural production and trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick help is needed in countries like niger the summit host , the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , had listed 22 countries that are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of high levels of chronic hunger - defined as more than 30 percent undernourishment - and being net importers of both food and fuel . countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected . to help such food-importing , low-income countries cope with the high food prices , the declaration specified donors and international financial institutions should " provide , in a timely manner , balance of payment support . " not enough pledges the summit was more successful in winning donor emergency aid to counter the food crisis , with several billion dollars pledged .
major donors included france with $ 1.5 billion , the saudi arabia-based islamic development bank , with $ 1.5 billion , the african development bank with $ 1 billion , and the world bank with $ 1.2 billion . other pledges included $ 773 million by spain over four years , $ 100 million by kuwait and $ 100 million from venezuela . un secretary general ban ki-moon suggested at the start of the summit that some $ 20 billion a year was needed to tackle hunger and that world food and production must be doubled by 2030 .

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .
germany look for smooth passage out of group b bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are preparing for thier campaign under wraps compared to the travails facing italy and france , tournament favorites germany should be in relaxed mood ahead of sunday 's group b encounter against poland in klagenfurt , especially as the group is completed by a poor austrian side and an injury-weakened croatia .
however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .
scolari mixed the two sides up in the second half as he continued his preparations for saturday 's group a opener against turkey .

veteran coach karel bruckner is another who believes privacy is necessary , banning the media from his side 's training sessions and holding his press conference at the team hotel in seefeld , austria , instead .
the 68-year-old said he already knew which was his preferred starting line-up and has no injury worries ahead of the swiss encounter .
tournament dark horses spain have to wait until next tuesday before taking on russia in the opening game in group d in innsbruck .
coach luis aragones has slight injury concerns over david villa and sergio garcia so omitted the pair from wednesday night 's final warm-up game against the united states .
thanks to a late goal from barcelona midfield xavi hernandez spain earned a 1-0 victory and spain now go to the tournament as europe 's form team , having won 16 and drawn two out of their last 18 games .
" we are most concerned about villa , " said team doctor jorge candel in santander .
" he took very hard knocks in training and see how things develop in the coming days . "
spainish hopes resting on young shoulders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain are hoping to put 44 years of hurt behind them villa is still expected to be fit to face guus hiddink 's russia while barcelona midfielder has joined up with the rest of the squad after undergoing treatment for food poisoning in a madrid clinic .
if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .
at least aragones can relax safe in the knowledge that the 24- year-old is willing to adapt his game for the cause .
" i am the one that needs to accustom myself to the way the team plays and not the other way round , " said torres .
" if this team is united and works as a unit , we can achieve great things . "

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .
germany look for smooth passage out of group b bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are preparing for thier campaign under wraps compared to the travails facing italy and france , tournament favorites germany should be in relaxed mood ahead of sunday 's group b encounter against poland in klagenfurt , especially as the group is completed by a poor austrian side and an injury-weakened croatia .
however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .
scolari mixed the two sides up in the second half as he continued his preparations for saturday 's group a opener against turkey .

veteran coach karel bruckner is another who believes privacy is necessary , banning the media from his side 's training sessions and holding his press conference at the team hotel in seefeld , austria , instead .
the 68-year-old said he already knew which was his preferred starting line-up and has no injury worries ahead of the swiss encounter .
tournament dark horses spain have to wait until next tuesday before taking on russia in the opening game in group d in innsbruck .
coach luis aragones has slight injury concerns over david villa and sergio garcia so omitted the pair from wednesday night 's final warm-up game against the united states .
thanks to a late goal from barcelona midfield xavi hernandez spain earned a 1-0 victory and spain now go to the tournament as europe 's form team , having won 16 and drawn two out of their last 18 games .
" we are most concerned about villa , " said team doctor jorge candel in santander .
" he took very hard knocks in training and see how things develop in the coming days . "
spainish hopes resting on young shoulders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain are hoping to put 44 years of hurt behind them villa is still expected to be fit to face guus hiddink 's russia while barcelona midfielder has joined up with the rest of the squad after undergoing treatment for food poisoning in a madrid clinic .
if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .
at least aragones can relax safe in the knowledge that the 24- year-old is willing to adapt his game for the cause .
" i am the one that needs to accustom myself to the way the team plays and not the other way round , " said torres .
" if this team is united and works as a unit , we can achieve great things . "

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .
the european commission , which proposed the plan last september , hopes that the move will end conflicts of interests that keep prices high and hold back investment .
giving the big guys a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big guys do n't want to give up their pipelines several eu countries , including france and germany , have introduced alternative ways to change the status quo after energy companies complained about the plan .
a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .
last week , fellow german energy group rwe proposed last week to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network in order to avoid a drawn-out anti-trust battle with the commission . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 06.06.2008 the fight for european soccer supremacy set to begin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the henri delaunay trophy , currently held by greece , is once again up for grabs the fight for the henri delaunay trophy begins on the field saturday , june 7 when euro co-hosts switzerland kick off euro 2008 against the czech republic at the st jakob-park stadium in basle . but some individual battles have already been fought and lost without a ball being kicked as teams try to gain a mental edge on opponents and the specter of a tournament-ruining injury plays heavily on the minds of europe 's top footballers ahead of the main event .
misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .
germany look for smooth passage out of group b bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are preparing for thier campaign under wraps compared to the travails facing italy and france , tournament favorites germany should be in relaxed mood ahead of sunday 's group b encounter against poland in klagenfurt , especially as the group is completed by a poor austrian side and an injury-weakened croatia .
however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .
scolari mixed the two sides up in the second half as he continued his preparations for saturday 's group a opener against turkey .
swiss open tournament against czechs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei and co. have a tough opening game earlier in the day , the czech republic face switzerland .
veteran coach karel bruckner is another who believes privacy is necessary , banning the media from his side 's training sessions and holding his press conference at the team hotel in seefeld , austria , instead .
the 68-year-old said he already knew which was his preferred starting line-up and has no injury worries ahead of the swiss encounter .
tournament dark horses spain have to wait until next tuesday before taking on russia in the opening game in group d in innsbruck .
coach luis aragones has slight injury concerns over david villa and sergio garcia so omitted the pair from wednesday night 's final warm-up game against the united states .
thanks to a late goal from barcelona midfield xavi hernandez spain earned a 1-0 victory and spain now go to the tournament as europe 's form team , having won 16 and drawn two out of their last 18 games .
" we are most concerned about villa , " said team doctor jorge candel in santander .
" he took very hard knocks in training and see how things develop in the coming days . "
spainish hopes resting on young shoulders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain are hoping to put 44 years of hurt behind them villa is still expected to be fit to face guus hiddink 's russia while barcelona midfielder has joined up with the rest of the squad after undergoing treatment for food poisoning in a madrid clinic .
if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .
at least aragones can relax safe in the knowledge that the 24- year-old is willing to adapt his game for the cause .
" i am the one that needs to accustom myself to the way the team plays and not the other way round , " said torres .
" if this team is united and works as a unit , we can achieve great things . "

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .
the european commission , which proposed the plan last september , hopes that the move will end conflicts of interests that keep prices high and hold back investment .
giving the big guys a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big guys do n't want to give up their pipelines several eu countries , including france and germany , have introduced alternative ways to change the status quo after energy companies complained about the plan .
a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .
last week , fellow german energy group rwe proposed last week to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network in order to avoid a drawn-out anti-trust battle with the commission . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it .

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it .

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a gray box site atop one of the hills .
workers from the netherlands , germany and italy have worked for the past six months to complete it .
in summer , canadian firm arise technologies will move in and begin to produce 1,500 solar cells per hour .
some level of improvisation 's still needed .
people are working on the roof of the giant aluminum hall while diggers are working on the ground outside .
but standing between construction containers , sjouke zijlstra , the plant 's dutch manager , is convinced that his company 's a beacon of hope for the town 's 13,000 residents .
" we 'll soon be the biggest shop in town , " he said .
limited jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant can still do with a touch of color to start with , the company needs 130 new employees , including 10 engineers .
it 's no wonder that the canadians received a warm welcome , considering that the town has an unemployment rate of 16 percent .
but zijlstra dampens too much enthusiasm by saying that the need for employees will remain limited .
" we have a highly automated production process , " the 62-year-old said .
some time will pass before regional suppliers profit from the solar cell plant and even then , mainly caterers , cleaning firms and craftsmen will find work there .
the first production line has already arrived and three more are expected to follow .
the lines will take up the entire length of the hall .
they 're fed gray , thing silicon plates that get turned into sparkling blue solar cells in the end .
the plates are cleaned and treated with chemicals in many steps that cost a lot of energy .
the plant will only cover a small portion of this with renewable energy from its own facilities on the roof .
" the amount of energy that we need is so large that we can not get it from just one facility , " zijlstra said while moving to the end of the line , where the quality of the solar cells is checked with light flashes that surround the blue discs .
sweetening the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for the first products the company did n't show up in bischofswerda out of the blue , though : german and eu subsidies did play an important role .
zijlstra said that the company gets subsidies of 50 percent - that 's 20 to 25 percent more than in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
" that 's a significant amount of money when you 're investing 50 million euros -lrb- $ 77.9 million -rrb- , " he said .
bischofswerda 's mayor , andreas erler , wooed investors for seven years before he managed to get them on board .
erler said he believes that his town 's proximity to leading solar research centers such as the one at dresden 's technical university , were an important selling point for arise .
the canadian investors , meanwhile , are optimistic as far as bischofswerda and the future development of solar cells is concerned .
if everything goes according to plan , nine more production halls will be built in the future - and hopefully attract other companies as well .
" when one firm gets started , others will follow , " zijlstra said .
he might be right : two more companies interested in processing solar cells recently dropped by bischofswerda . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 06.06.2008 nazi compensation claims threaten german centers in italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distomo case has been dragging on for years if germany refuses to pay compensation to nazi victims in italy and greece , its cultural institutes in italy might face a levy of execution . the supreme court of cassation in rome has ruled that compensation claims brought by wartime italian soldiers who were interned and forced into labor by the nazis are legitimate .
the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .
the european commission , which proposed the plan last september , hopes that the move will end conflicts of interests that keep prices high and hold back investment .

a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .
last week , fellow german energy group rwe proposed last week to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network in order to avoid a drawn-out anti-trust battle with the commission . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

giving the big guys a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big guys do n't want to give up their pipelines several eu countries , including france and germany , have introduced alternative ways to change the status quo after energy companies complained about the plan .
a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .
last week , fellow german energy group rwe proposed last week to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network in order to avoid a drawn-out anti-trust battle with the commission . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .
russia sees georgia 's bid for nato membership as an encroachment of its power in the region . georgia has negotiated with nato the possibility of joining the alliance , although a timeframe has not been laid down . medvedev rejects outside help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is staunchly opposed to georgia joining nato tensions have risen in recent weeks after georgia accused a russian fighter jet of shooting down one of its spy planes on april 20 .
tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one group has now come up with a shocking way to deter potential clients . a young , frightened woman ends up as a prostitute after she 's auctioned off like cattle by a crowd of men , who wildly scream at each other - that 's the content of a video clip by the swiss campaign against trafficking in women during euro 2008 . the film will be broadcast on swiss television , in soccer stadiums and at public viewing events to shake up potential clients of prostitutes .
gaby vermot , who heads the campaign , said that the championships are a unique opportunity to educate people about forced prostitution . members of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality in the european parliament agree and have called for a broad-based societal initiative against forced prostitution ahead of the championships , which will take place in austria and switzerland starting saturday , june 7 . showing the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 500,000 women from eastern europe are forced prostitutes anna zaborska , a slovak conservative member of the european parliament , who heads the committee , said that a " red card for forced prostitution , " introduced during the world cup in germany in 2006 , should be revived during the current competition . lissy groener , a german social democratic committee member , said that the 2006 campaign had been successful . " two years ago , a large campaign made sure that the expected increase of forced prostitution was prevented , " she said . groener added that up to 800,000 women become victims of forced prostitution each year . " this is one of the most upsetting violation of human rights nowadays , " she said . double trouble more than half a million women from eastern europe alone are forced into prostitution each year , according to the committee .
groener said that the women are put in a difficult situation for two reasons : on the one hand , they 're illegal immigrants in the country that they 've been brought to .
on the other hand , they 're forced to prostitute themselves . " much more has to happen , " groener said , referring to more action taken by the eu commission .
at the same time , the campaign is not about pointing fingers at the host countries , she added . " as political mouth pieces for the affected women , we want to put a stop to this modern form of slavery , " she said . getting the facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything but glamorous christa prets , an austrian committee member , added that the campaign was also not interested in castigating soccer events . " it 's simply a fact that there 's more prostitution during soccer events and big events in general , " she said . committee members said that they do n't have any definitive figures on how much forced prostitution takes place during such events .
that 's part of the problem , prets said , and called for more data collection . " we wo n't be able to register all prostitutes and all illegal sex workers , but it would be good to have a common european data collection system , " she said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers . " fellmann added that it would be better for berlin to offer tax and other relief to farmers to leave the industry . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers . " fellmann added that it would be better for berlin to offer tax and other relief to farmers to leave the industry . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a gray box site atop one of the hills .
workers from the netherlands , germany and italy have worked for the past six months to complete it .
in summer , canadian firm arise technologies will move in and begin to produce 1,500 solar cells per hour .
some level of improvisation 's still needed .
people are working on the roof of the giant aluminum hall while diggers are working on the ground outside .
but standing between construction containers , sjouke zijlstra , the plant 's dutch manager , is convinced that his company 's a beacon of hope for the town 's 13,000 residents .
" we 'll soon be the biggest shop in town , " he said .
limited jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant can still do with a touch of color to start with , the company needs 130 new employees , including 10 engineers .
it 's no wonder that the canadians received a warm welcome , considering that the town has an unemployment rate of 16 percent .
but zijlstra dampens too much enthusiasm by saying that the need for employees will remain limited .
" we have a highly automated production process , " the 62-year-old said .
some time will pass before regional suppliers profit from the solar cell plant and even then , mainly caterers , cleaning firms and craftsmen will find work there .
the first production line has already arrived and three more are expected to follow .
the lines will take up the entire length of the hall .
they 're fed gray , thing silicon plates that get turned into sparkling blue solar cells in the end .
the plates are cleaned and treated with chemicals in many steps that cost a lot of energy .
the plant will only cover a small portion of this with renewable energy from its own facilities on the roof .
" the amount of energy that we need is so large that we can not get it from just one facility , " zijlstra said while moving to the end of the line , where the quality of the solar cells is checked with light flashes that surround the blue discs .
sweetening the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for the first products the company did n't show up in bischofswerda out of the blue , though : german and eu subsidies did play an important role .
zijlstra said that the company gets subsidies of 50 percent - that 's 20 to 25 percent more than in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
" that 's a significant amount of money when you 're investing 50 million euros -lrb- $ 77.9 million -rrb- , " he said .
bischofswerda 's mayor , andreas erler , wooed investors for seven years before he managed to get them on board .
erler said he believes that his town 's proximity to leading solar research centers such as the one at dresden 's technical university , were an important selling point for arise .
the canadian investors , meanwhile , are optimistic as far as bischofswerda and the future development of solar cells is concerned .
if everything goes according to plan , nine more production halls will be built in the future - and hopefully attract other companies as well .
" when one firm gets started , others will follow , " zijlstra said .
he might be right : two more companies interested in processing solar cells recently dropped by bischofswerda . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .

however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .

if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .
" each year we think that maybe this will be his last but he just seems to carry on regardless . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the unidentified perpetrators , believed to be right-wing extremists , demolished flower pots and the entrance door to the site , according to memorial officials . the suspects also tried unsuccessfully to smash in a security-glass window at the museum , which highlights the death march of inmates from sachsenhausen concentration camp during the last days of world war ii .
in april 1945 , some 33,000 inmates were forced to march north and many died along the way .
about 16,000 inmates were left in below forest , where the memorial is now located . it 's not the first attack on the memorial : in 2002 , an arson attack almost completely destroyed the museum , which is situated in a secluded location of the forest . " the new attack on the museum worries us greatly , " said guenter morsch , who heads the memorial sites in brandenburg .
the attack proved that memorial sites were still targets for neo-nazi attacks , he added . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 06.06.2008 the fight for european soccer supremacy set to begin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the henri delaunay trophy , currently held by greece , is once again up for grabs the fight for the henri delaunay trophy begins on the field saturday , june 7 when euro co-hosts switzerland kick off euro 2008 against the czech republic at the st jakob-park stadium in basle . but some individual battles have already been fought and lost without a ball being kicked as teams try to gain a mental edge on opponents and the specter of a tournament-ruining injury plays heavily on the minds of europe 's top footballers ahead of the main event .
misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .
germany look for smooth passage out of group b bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are preparing for thier campaign under wraps compared to the travails facing italy and france , tournament favorites germany should be in relaxed mood ahead of sunday 's group b encounter against poland in klagenfurt , especially as the group is completed by a poor austrian side and an injury-weakened croatia .
however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .
scolari mixed the two sides up in the second half as he continued his preparations for saturday 's group a opener against turkey .
swiss open tournament against czechs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei and co. have a tough opening game earlier in the day , the czech republic face switzerland .
veteran coach karel bruckner is another who believes privacy is necessary , banning the media from his side 's training sessions and holding his press conference at the team hotel in seefeld , austria , instead .
the 68-year-old said he already knew which was his preferred starting line-up and has no injury worries ahead of the swiss encounter .
tournament dark horses spain have to wait until next tuesday before taking on russia in the opening game in group d in innsbruck .
coach luis aragones has slight injury concerns over david villa and sergio garcia so omitted the pair from wednesday night 's final warm-up game against the united states .
thanks to a late goal from barcelona midfield xavi hernandez spain earned a 1-0 victory and spain now go to the tournament as europe 's form team , having won 16 and drawn two out of their last 18 games .
" we are most concerned about villa , " said team doctor jorge candel in santander .
" he took very hard knocks in training and see how things develop in the coming days . "
spainish hopes resting on young shoulders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain are hoping to put 44 years of hurt behind them villa is still expected to be fit to face guus hiddink 's russia while barcelona midfielder has joined up with the rest of the squad after undergoing treatment for food poisoning in a madrid clinic .
if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .
at least aragones can relax safe in the knowledge that the 24- year-old is willing to adapt his game for the cause .
" i am the one that needs to accustom myself to the way the team plays and not the other way round , " said torres .
" if this team is united and works as a unit , we can achieve great things . "

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .

but campaigners say rich nations need to do more to boost food output and free trade . delegates representing some 181 nations at a food summit in rome on thursday , june 5 , issued a declaration on fighting world hunger , which has been exacerbated by the highest food prices in 30 years , but failed to agree on a set of concrete proposals . the declaration reaffirmed a 1996 pledge by world leaders to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
current estimates put the number of hungry at more than 862 million . however , with participants divided over the causes of the soaring food costs and what role biofuels play in food prices , the declaration stopped short of setting firm , long-term measures to deal with the crisis . more action needed the summit was an " important first step " but not sufficient to tackle the global food crisis , british charity oxfam said . oxfam chief executive barbara stocking said in a statement that , while leaders of the world 's richest countries had " acknowledged the importance of aid to agriculture , " the global food crisis needed " a wide-ranging plan to resolve it . " " as the world 's most powerful countries , they must provide more money to deal with the immediate impact of the current crisis but also tackle some of the contributing causes by ending compulsory biofuels targets and providing more long term aid for agriculture , " she said .
" the current crisis illustrates starkly that what we need is not business as usual but deep reform of the international trading system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul saw the conference as an important impulse the declaration was criticized even before it was formally agreed , with italian foreign minister franco frattini calling it " disappointing . "
the text was " unfortunately very watered down with respect to the initial ambitions , " he said , according to the ansa news agency . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul meanwhile said that the conference was " an important programmatic impulse . " " the global food crisis has to remain on top of the agenda for the international community , " she said . short-term results wrangling over the document - in particular objections over its wording by argentina , venezuela and cuba - delayed its adoption until late in the evening , many hours later than expected . disagreements also remained over trade barriers , such as import tariffs and other taxes , and food export restrictions , with some countries opposing the easing or lifting of such measures . instead , the declaration committed its signatories to two immediate and short-term lines of action : to respond urgently to requests for assistance from hunger-threatened countries and to lend immediate support for agricultural production and trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quick help is needed in countries like niger the summit host , the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , had listed 22 countries that are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of high levels of chronic hunger - defined as more than 30 percent undernourishment - and being net importers of both food and fuel . countries such as eritrea , niger , comoros , haiti and liberia are particularly affected . to help such food-importing , low-income countries cope with the high food prices , the declaration specified donors and international financial institutions should " provide , in a timely manner , balance of payment support . " not enough pledges the summit was more successful in winning donor emergency aid to counter the food crisis , with several billion dollars pledged .
major donors included france with $ 1.5 billion , the saudi arabia-based islamic development bank , with $ 1.5 billion , the african development bank with $ 1 billion , and the world bank with $ 1.2 billion . other pledges included $ 773 million by spain over four years , $ 100 million by kuwait and $ 100 million from venezuela . un secretary general ban ki-moon suggested at the start of the summit that some $ 20 billion a year was needed to tackle hunger and that world food and production must be doubled by 2030 .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .

one group has now come up with a shocking way to deter potential clients . a young , frightened woman ends up as a prostitute after she 's auctioned off like cattle by a crowd of men , who wildly scream at each other - that 's the content of a video clip by the swiss campaign against trafficking in women during euro 2008 . the film will be broadcast on swiss television , in soccer stadiums and at public viewing events to shake up potential clients of prostitutes .
gaby vermot , who heads the campaign , said that the championships are a unique opportunity to educate people about forced prostitution . members of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality in the european parliament agree and have called for a broad-based societal initiative against forced prostitution ahead of the championships , which will take place in austria and switzerland starting saturday , june 7 . showing the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 500,000 women from eastern europe are forced prostitutes anna zaborska , a slovak conservative member of the european parliament , who heads the committee , said that a " red card for forced prostitution , " introduced during the world cup in germany in 2006 , should be revived during the current competition . lissy groener , a german social democratic committee member , said that the 2006 campaign had been successful . " two years ago , a large campaign made sure that the expected increase of forced prostitution was prevented , " she said . groener added that up to 800,000 women become victims of forced prostitution each year . " this is one of the most upsetting violation of human rights nowadays , " she said . double trouble more than half a million women from eastern europe alone are forced into prostitution each year , according to the committee .
groener said that the women are put in a difficult situation for two reasons : on the one hand , they 're illegal immigrants in the country that they 've been brought to .
on the other hand , they 're forced to prostitute themselves . " much more has to happen , " groener said , referring to more action taken by the eu commission .
at the same time , the campaign is not about pointing fingers at the host countries , she added . " as political mouth pieces for the affected women , we want to put a stop to this modern form of slavery , " she said . getting the facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything but glamorous christa prets , an austrian committee member , added that the campaign was also not interested in castigating soccer events . " it 's simply a fact that there 's more prostitution during soccer events and big events in general , " she said . committee members said that they do n't have any definitive figures on how much forced prostitution takes place during such events .
that 's part of the problem , prets said , and called for more data collection . " we wo n't be able to register all prostitutes and all illegal sex workers , but it would be good to have a common european data collection system , " she said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the unidentified perpetrators , believed to be right-wing extremists , demolished flower pots and the entrance door to the site , according to memorial officials . the suspects also tried unsuccessfully to smash in a security-glass window at the museum , which highlights the death march of inmates from sachsenhausen concentration camp during the last days of world war ii .
in april 1945 , some 33,000 inmates were forced to march north and many died along the way .
about 16,000 inmates were left in below forest , where the memorial is now located . it 's not the first attack on the memorial : in 2002 , an arson attack almost completely destroyed the museum , which is situated in a secluded location of the forest . " the new attack on the museum worries us greatly , " said guenter morsch , who heads the memorial sites in brandenburg .
the attack proved that memorial sites were still targets for neo-nazi attacks , he added . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated .

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .
the european commission , which proposed the plan last september , hopes that the move will end conflicts of interests that keep prices high and hold back investment .
giving the big guys a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big guys do n't want to give up their pipelines several eu countries , including france and germany , have introduced alternative ways to change the status quo after energy companies complained about the plan .
a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .
last week , fellow german energy group rwe proposed last week to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network in order to avoid a drawn-out anti-trust battle with the commission . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german energy giant vows to unbundle gas network german energy group rwe proposed to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network to end the eu 's anti-trust case targeting the firm 's control of its home gas market .
-lrb- 01.06.2008 -rrb- eu agrees to germany 's electricity unbundling proposal a german plan to unbundle the country 's power grid by transferring all four high-voltage networks into a joint holding dubbed netz was agreed to by the eu commission , a press report said wednesday .

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .
the european commission , which proposed the plan last september , hopes that the move will end conflicts of interests that keep prices high and hold back investment .
giving the big guys a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big guys do n't want to give up their pipelines several eu countries , including france and germany , have introduced alternative ways to change the status quo after energy companies complained about the plan .
a compromise proposal by the slovenian eu presidency would now spare some of the continent 's biggest energy companies from being broken up .
according to the slovenian plan , energy companies would still own distribution infrastructure as long as the operators of gas pipelines and power transmission lines are highly independent of the parent company .
backers of full separation , such as denmark and the netherlands , want any alternative to be only a temporary arrangement that would be eventually phased out .
running out of time if an agreement on the main principles of the reform are not reached soon , little progress is likely for some time .
france , which is deeply opposed to the idea of breaking up big national champions in the energy sector , takes over the european union 's rotating presidency in july for the rest of the year .
some energy giants have already taken stepps to sell their distribution networks in order to avoid eu anti-trust problems .
german energy group eon said earlier this year it was planning to sell its high-voltage electricity network in the face of concerns from eu regulators .
last week , fellow german energy group rwe proposed last week to sell off its 4,100 kilometers -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- of gas transmission network in order to avoid a drawn-out anti-trust battle with the commission . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .
russia sees georgia 's bid for nato membership as an encroachment of its power in the region . georgia has negotiated with nato the possibility of joining the alliance , although a timeframe has not been laid down . medvedev rejects outside help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is staunchly opposed to georgia joining nato tensions have risen in recent weeks after georgia accused a russian fighter jet of shooting down one of its spy planes on april 20 .
tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .
russia sees georgia 's bid for nato membership as an encroachment of its power in the region . georgia has negotiated with nato the possibility of joining the alliance , although a timeframe has not been laid down . medvedev rejects outside help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is staunchly opposed to georgia joining nato tensions have risen in recent weeks after georgia accused a russian fighter jet of shooting down one of its spy planes on april 20 .
tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .

however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers . " fellmann added that it would be better for berlin to offer tax and other relief to farmers to leave the industry . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers . " fellmann added that it would be better for berlin to offer tax and other relief to farmers to leave the industry . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one group has now come up with a shocking way to deter potential clients . a young , frightened woman ends up as a prostitute after she 's auctioned off like cattle by a crowd of men , who wildly scream at each other - that 's the content of a video clip by the swiss campaign against trafficking in women during euro 2008 . the film will be broadcast on swiss television , in soccer stadiums and at public viewing events to shake up potential clients of prostitutes .
gaby vermot , who heads the campaign , said that the championships are a unique opportunity to educate people about forced prostitution . members of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality in the european parliament agree and have called for a broad-based societal initiative against forced prostitution ahead of the championships , which will take place in austria and switzerland starting saturday , june 7 . showing the red card bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 500,000 women from eastern europe are forced prostitutes anna zaborska , a slovak conservative member of the european parliament , who heads the committee , said that a " red card for forced prostitution , " introduced during the world cup in germany in 2006 , should be revived during the current competition . lissy groener , a german social democratic committee member , said that the 2006 campaign had been successful . " two years ago , a large campaign made sure that the expected increase of forced prostitution was prevented , " she said . groener added that up to 800,000 women become victims of forced prostitution each year . " this is one of the most upsetting violation of human rights nowadays , " she said . double trouble more than half a million women from eastern europe alone are forced into prostitution each year , according to the committee .
groener said that the women are put in a difficult situation for two reasons : on the one hand , they 're illegal immigrants in the country that they 've been brought to .
on the other hand , they 're forced to prostitute themselves . " much more has to happen , " groener said , referring to more action taken by the eu commission .

after weeks of debate , the german parliament gave the green light friday , june 6 to wide-reaching legislation on climate protection , a day before a meeting in japan between the energy ministers of the g8 nations . the bundestag passed legislation that trims cross-subsidies for the booming solar-power industry while boosting other methods of cutting carbon emissions when generating electricity . " this is a major step forward , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel . the new laws are designed to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent less than 1990 levels by 2020 .
so far , a 20 percent reduction has already been reached , with the four new laws expected to result in a further 10 percent drop . the government hopes to see a doubling of green electricity to 30 percent by 2020 , with wind energy boosted and solar energy cut back . package of bills the package included increasing the number of combined heat and power generation plants and focusing on electricity and heat from renewable sources , as well as allowing competition among electricity and gas meter reader companies . tele-heating , where power stations pipe their surplus hot water into homes during europe 's chilly winters , is to be encouraged .
by 2020 , about a quarter of german electricity stations will use their waste heat this way .
about one eighth do so now . the package of bills also encourages improved insulation so that centrally heated buildings do not lose so much heat through walls , ceilings and windows . germany 's early enthusiasm for photovoltaic systems , which convert sunlight into electricity , has faded a little , with the emphasis back on wind turbines and geothermal plants that obtain heat from the soil , and sometimes from hot rock deep underground . controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal plants need to be equipped with state of the art technology gabriel admitted that the new laws would entail a hike in energy prices . with an election due next year , the legislation has been controversial because the extra costs will be loaded onto householders ' and businesses ' electricity bills at a time when german consumers are already glum over soaring fuel costs . under a compromise hammered out by chancellor angela merkel 's government , power companies are to pay less for power fed into the national grid from solar panels on the roofs of homes , but will come under pressure to use more wind power . the legislation faces its next test in the bundesrat upper house , where the 16 state governments hold sway . energy technology revolution meanwhile , the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said the same day that the world needed to spend one percent of its economic output every year to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , calling for an " energy technology revolution " to curb global warming . unless governments act now , carbon dioxide emissions will rise by 130 percent by the middle of the century and oil demand will grow 70 percent , the iea said in the report published in tokyo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel conceded that energy prices would rise to halve carbon dioxide emissions , the world would need to spend an additional 29 trillion euros -lrb- $ 45 trillion -rrb- on clean energy technologies by 2050 - one percent of average annual gross domestic product over the period , it estimated . " there should be no doubt that meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable challenge , " nobuo tanaka , executive director of the paris-based iea , told a press conference .
" we would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale .
it would essentially require a new global technological revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy . " halving emissions would require on average about 35 coal and 20 gas-fired power plants every year to be fitted with the technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they belch out , the report said . the world would also need to build an additional 32 new nuclear power plants every year along with 17,500 wind turbines . tanaka noted that , according to the un-backed intergovernmental panel on climate change , such deep emission cuts are needed to limit global warming to two to three degrees celsius up to the end of the century . the iea said no single form of energy or technology could solve the problem alone , calling for increased use of carbon dioxide capture and storage , renewable and nuclear energy and better energy efficiency . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if everything goes according to plan , nine more production halls will be built in the future - and hopefully attract other companies as well .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .

goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .

however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .

if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .

misfortune has certainly struck world champions italy , who have to do without captain fabio cannavaro after the defender suffered ankle ligament damage in training while dutch winger ryan babel succumbed to a similar injury .
cannavaro has decided to stay on in austria and switzerland to support his teammates during the june 7-29 tournament , starting for italy with a mouthwatering group c encounter against the netherlands on monday in berne .
world cup finalists france , who are also in group c , face romania on the same day in zurich with coach raymond domenech hoping midfielders patrick vieira and franck ribery recover in time from thigh and ankle injuries respectively .
ribery picked up his knock in tuesday 's 1-0 friendly win over colombia , a match that vieira played no part in after the inter milan midfielder limped out of a training session last week .
mathieu flamini is waiting in the wings if vieira loses his race for fitness , with domenech painfully aware that with tough group games against the netherlands on june 13 and italy on june 17 , his side needs to hit the ground running or face early elimination .
germany look for smooth passage out of group b bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are preparing for thier campaign under wraps compared to the travails facing italy and france , tournament favorites germany should be in relaxed mood ahead of sunday 's group b encounter against poland in klagenfurt , especially as the group is completed by a poor austrian side and an injury-weakened croatia .
however , despite also having a full-strength 23-man squad to pick from coach joachim loew says there is huge pressure on his side to deliver at euro and build on the performances at the 2006 world cup , when germany as hosts made it to the semi-finals before going out to the azzurri .
" of course , i 'm aware of my responsibilities , " said loew .
" but you can only judge the team at the end of the tournament . "
nothing has been left to chance with german training sessions taking place behind closed doors to make sure poland coach leo beenhakker does n't find out how the germans intend to line up on sunday .
loew is determined to continue with the exclusion policy for the duration of the competition .
while the germans bank on secrecy , 2004 finalists portugal are doing the opposite .
luiz felipe scolari 's side went through their paces tuesday in neuchatel in front of more than 12,000 fans , with virtually the entire squad , including cristiano ronaldo , playing a full practice match .
scolari mixed the two sides up in the second half as he continued his preparations for saturday 's group a opener against turkey .
swiss open tournament against czechs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander frei and co. have a tough opening game earlier in the day , the czech republic face switzerland .
veteran coach karel bruckner is another who believes privacy is necessary , banning the media from his side 's training sessions and holding his press conference at the team hotel in seefeld , austria , instead .
the 68-year-old said he already knew which was his preferred starting line-up and has no injury worries ahead of the swiss encounter .
tournament dark horses spain have to wait until next tuesday before taking on russia in the opening game in group d in innsbruck .
coach luis aragones has slight injury concerns over david villa and sergio garcia so omitted the pair from wednesday night 's final warm-up game against the united states .
thanks to a late goal from barcelona midfield xavi hernandez spain earned a 1-0 victory and spain now go to the tournament as europe 's form team , having won 16 and drawn two out of their last 18 games .
" we are most concerned about villa , " said team doctor jorge candel in santander .
" he took very hard knocks in training and see how things develop in the coming days . "

if spain are to go all the way in austria and switzerland , aragones has to figure out a way to integrate star fernando torres into the team so that the striker reproduces the form that saw him break the 30-goal barrier in his first season for liverpool .
at least aragones can relax safe in the knowledge that the 24- year-old is willing to adapt his game for the cause .

european energy ministers on friday were finding it hard to reach an agreement over proposals to bring more competition to the eu 's gas and power markets by taking apart the continent 's big energy companies . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that a failure to reach agreement would have serious consequences for everyone .
" i ask you not to miss this opportunity , " piebalgs said , according to news reports .
the main controversy among countries remains whether gas and electricity concerns should be forced to spin off their retail distribution networks into separate companies , hence creating more competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.06.2008 russia rejects western help in abkhazia conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both georgia and russia lay claim to the abkhazia region russia warned georgia against joining nato , saying membership would only lead to more bloodshed in separatist abkhazia .
the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .
russia sees georgia 's bid for nato membership as an encroachment of its power in the region . georgia has negotiated with nato the possibility of joining the alliance , although a timeframe has not been laid down . medvedev rejects outside help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is staunchly opposed to georgia joining nato tensions have risen in recent weeks after georgia accused a russian fighter jet of shooting down one of its spy planes on april 20 .
tbilisi has since tried to lobby international support , which has only further angered russia . speaking ahead of friday 's summit , which was seen as an early test of his foreign relations credentials , medvedev insisted that international mediation was not necessary in resolving the conflict . " i think that we , on our own , are the most capable of resolving the questions , overcoming the difficulties that exist and building our relationship for the long run , " said the russian president , who took office on may 7 . the comments coincided with a meeting friday between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and rebel leaders in abkhazia .
solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .
over 2,500 russian peacekeepers have patrolled the autonomous region since a 1994 un ceasefire agreement that ended civil war , and most abkhaz residents have been issued russian passports in recent years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the moscow-tbilisi conflict could be resolved without international help , said russia 's president . speaking at an informal summit of former soviet states near saint petersburg on friday , june 6 , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a resolution to the conflict in the breakaway georgian region would not be achieved if georgia joins nato . " this would lead to another spiral of confrontation in the area , " said lavrov . the foreign minister also said that russian president dmitry medvedev had at the summit pressed his georgian counterpart mikheil saakashvili to commit to not using force against moscow-backed separatists in abkhazia . abkhazia broke from george in a conflict in the early 1990s and is now backed by moscow , which has traditionally viewed georgia as part of its sphere of influence .

solana has said that the eu wants to become more deeply involved in the mediating the conflict . tbilisi seeks withdrawal of russian troops " i think we can sort out our relations by ourselves , " said medvedev .
turning to saakashvili , he asked : " what do you think ? " responding with agreement , the georgian president said , " there are no problems that can not be solved when there is mutual understanding . "
he added that russia and georgia are countries with a close historical and cultural connection . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia recently beefed up its peacekeeping force in abkhazia saakashvili has said in the past that he hopes the new russian presidency will provide a window for better relations after a difficult relationship with medvedev 's predecessor and mentor , vladimir putin . on the other hand , saakashvili has said he would ask medvedev to revoke an order signed by putin in april regarding closer ties with abkhazia and that he would seek the withdrawal of russian troops from the region . following a un report corroborating tbilisi 's claims that moscow was behind the shooting down of its spy plane , the united states has backed georgia in demanding the departure of russian troops deployed to abkhazia . moscow , meanwhile , has stepped up diplomatic ties with the breakaway region and sent additional troops to the region last saturday , a move condemned by both nato and the us .

many say the problems that plague the industry remain . dairy factories warned on friday , june 6 , that promises by german discount grocers to pay higher wholesale prices for milk and butter have changed little . at a time when international milk prices are low and the european union is warning farmers to get ready for a market-driven , quota-free world , many small farms may fail . for 10 heady days , the farmers let off steam and won mostly sympathetic attention from the media .
but for those on the edge of bankruptcy , the loss of 10 days of income was a terrible price to pay . thomas fellmann from germany 's university of hohenheim said , " they won out in the short term .
but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .
bdm defines a fair price as 43 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- per liter . current farm-gate prices range between 27 and 33 cents , depending on the region in germany .
farms in the north and east are much bigger , and can get by on lower prices than the tiny farms in the south where germany slopes up to the alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher prices may not solve the sector 's fundamental problems the boycott ended after lidl and aldi , germany 's two main discount grocery stores , offered to pay higher prices wholesale for fresh milk and butter .
the offer sounded good , but is unlikely to bring fundamental change . susanne nuessel , secretary of an association of dairy factories , warned , " farmers think they are going to be paid 43 cents from now on .
no chance . "
she said that price was illusory , since neither shoppers nor export customers would accept significant increases . price worries do n't stop at supermarkets fresh milk may be nourishing , but at 60 cents a liter retail in germany it costs less , liter for liter , than soft drinks .
discount grocers have hinted they will edge the minimum retail price up to 70 cents , and boost the butter price too . but , as nuessel said , there has been no commitment to boost retail prices for yoghurt , cheese or cream .
in addition , only 45 percent of german dairy output ends up in supermarkets .
the rest is exported or used as an industrial feedstock . german dairy industry figures show there were 102,000 milk-producing farms with 4 million cows last year .
of the 29 million tons of milk they produce annually , more than 2 million tons are exported .
germany also imports specialty cheeses and other dairy products equivalent to 1.5 million tons . dairy farmers to face open market the output of every farm is largely fixed under european union quotas which were first introduced in 1984 to eliminate europe 's famous butter mountains , the vast surplus caused by earlier minimum prices . in april this year , the eu raised the quotas by 2 percent , partly with an eye to world food shortages .
the milk price fell .
by 2015 , the quotas and guaranteed prices are supposed to be gone completely and dairy farmers will be exposed the chill winds of the market . economists say inefficient farms are bound to fail .
since quotas were introduced , the number of dairy farms has been declining about 5 percent annually per decade in germany .
fellmann says berlin has to tell the farmers the hard truth . " the government should not awaken any false hopes .
quotas will be finished in 2015 , " he said .
" you get the impression that many farmers think berlin is going to help them somehow or other and erect some kind of new protectionist barriers .

but the structural problems of dairy farming have not been resolved . " higher prices a short-term solution germany 's bdm dairy farmers ' association says the pricing mechanism remains unfair to small farms and its ultimate aim is to alter pricing and supply rules .

the court threw out germany ’ s objections that berlin 's " sovereign immunity " meant it could not be sued in an italian court , reported italian daily la repubblica on thursday , june 5 .
germany has no right to cite state immunity against the italian civil proceedings , decided the court , on the grounds that there is " no doubt that the international community deems the deportation of these people and their coercion into labor as a crime against humanity . "
germany had denied compensation to the soldiers who were interned after fascist italy declared a truce in september 1943 .
the nazis then took control in italy and deported many of the interned italian soldiers to germany to work in factories for no pay .
berlin has in the past compensated italian civilians forced to work .
in this case , however , it argues that the deportees were prisoners of war and there was no basis for the claim .
epic decision the ruling marks the latest twist to a series of world war ii compensation claims dogging germany .
in another case , the german government could end up paying up to 28 million euros -lrb- $ 93.54 million -rrb- to families of the victims of a nazi ss massacre in the greek village of distomo in 1944 , when troops murdered 218 men , women and children .
the case was heard in italy after greece 's highest court ruled in 2002 against the claimants , arguing that greek courts could not try cases against a foreign country .
the litigants took the case to italy , to see if they could reach a more favorable ruling there - as has happened .
the italian court ruled that if germany refuses to cooperate , german assets in italy could be seized as collateral .
martin klingner , the claimants ' hamburg-based lawyer , described the move as an " epic decision . "
legal saga the ruling was part of a long legal saga for victims seeking damages for massacres in over 60 greek towns and villages .
germany maintained that it settled all such claims in the 1960s with a payment of 43 million euros and refused to pay .
the greek court subsequently authorized the seizure and auction of german state properties in athens , including the goethe institute , the german schools in both athens and thessalonica , as well as the german archaeological institute .
but the greek government refused to approve selling the land for compensation , and court officials stopped trying to seize german property after berlin launched a legal appeal .
in 2003 , germany 's federal court of justice said that germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago .
foreclosure sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cultural centers in italy might come under the hammer if germany refuses to pay this time , italy has threatened that german cultural centers in the country , such as the german-italian cultural center villa vigoni on lake como , will come under the hammer .
goethe institutes in italy could also be auctioned off .
the german government has so far refused to comment on the court decisions , although a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that berlin was mulling its next move , but that german property in italy such as consulates and cultural institutes would be protected by diplomatic immunity .
according to reports , international law experts believe germany may lodge a case against italy with the international court of justice in the hague , which could prove highly damaging to german-italian relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his tips for longevity might not make health professionals very happy . allingham marked his birthday on friday , june 6 , by attending a flypast of fighter aircraft from the battle of britain .
he saw active service in the battle of jutland in world war i and was one of the first members of the raf .
born in 1896 , when the first modern olympics were held in athens and queen victoria still had some five years left on the british throne , allingham worked for carmaker ford in civilian life .
he now lives in a home for blind former military personnel and said he 's in robust health .
" i 'm a lucky guy , " he said .
" i am looking forward to a wonderful day and to seeing the family .
i just hope i do n't let the side down .
people ask me how i 've done it , and i just say that i look forward to another tomorrow . "
a zest for life eight of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren and their partners have travelled from their homes in the united states for the occasion .
allingham 's wife of 51 years , dorothy , died in 1970 .
allingham said he believed his longevity came from " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women . "
but his close friend , dennis goodwin , who founded an association for world war i veterans , paid tribute to allingham 's zest for life .
" he is simply an incredible man , " goodwin said .
" each year we think that maybe this will be his last but he just seems to carry on regardless . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are hundreds of people walking round wales with bowel cancer tumours and they do n't know they 've got them . "
the spokesman for the welsh assembly government said the bowel screening programme was on schedule to be introduced in october .

he said .
mr phillips 's wife marcia died of bowel cancer almost two years ago at the age of 45 .
" screening earlier would save lives , " he added .
" the sooner they bring it in the better . "
bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in the uk after lung cancer but if caught early 90 % of cases can be treated successfully .
former am glyn davies contracted bowel cancer almost six years ago at the age of 58 , and made a good recovery after surgery . "
i 'm disappointed by the delays because we know that lives would be saved " former am glyn davies " i know how lucky i was , " said mr davies , now the president of the campaign for the protection of rural wales .
" the position of the tumour meant it could be discovered without screening but for most people that is not the case .
" i 'm disappointed by the delays because we know that lives would be saved .
we know that two in every 1,000 people who are screened have bowel cancer .
" there are hundreds of people walking round wales with bowel cancer tumours and they do n't know they 've got them . "
the spokesman for the welsh assembly government said the bowel screening programme was on schedule to be introduced in october .
he added : " it is vital that the introduction of a screening programme does not disadvantage those that have symptoms suggestive of bowel disease .
" after detailed planning for the programme it became clear that more time would be needed for the roll-out . "
he said that the phased implementation of screening programmes was in line with other programmes such as breast test wales .

the campaign in wales has seen the wftf , which has received funding from the assembly government , encourage schools , businesses and other organisations to switch to fair trade products .
it also obtained a commitment from the assembly government to use fair trade goods .
more than 1,000 volunteers have helped to persuade 58 towns , 380 schools and groups in all 22 welsh counties to commit to learning about fair trade and use fair trade products .
an independent panel of fair trade experts from britain and europe reviewed all of the evidence collated and congratulated wales on its progress .
the wftf is now planning to implement the second phase of its campaign which will focus on increasing buying and using fair trade products .
summit andy wilson of wftf said it hoped the model pioneered by wales would be adopted by other countries .
" wales as far as the uk is concerned , is pioneering .
but there is still a long way to go before we can say everyone in wales is committed to fair trade , " he said .
" we hope the work that has been done in wales will benefit producers in the third world and in turn we will benefit from the stronger relationships we build with the developing world . "
up to 30 fair trade producers from across the globe will meet sustainability minister jane davidson , as well as activists and welsh suppliers , in a summit in newport later .
mr morgan said wales ' progress in adopting fair trade showed " how a small country like ours can make a difference " .

it has been dubbed the " pub taxi scandal " because often cooler boxes with cold beers were provided in the back of cabs for the bureaucrats .
news that officials took inducements from taxi firms to use their services may not surprise many japanese .
bureaucrats are thought to be more powerful than politicians in japan .
some japanese feel that makes them arrogant .
the details emerged after the opposition requested an investigation into the finance ministry .
officials were found to have admitted receiving cash , beer , soft drinks and snacks in return for using the same cab firms again and again on journeys funded by the tax payer .
in one case a bureaucrat admitted receiving more than $ 20,000 -lrb- £ 10,200 -rrb- of cash and gift certificates over a five year period .
it is more bad news for a government which is deeply unpopular - polls suggest only one in five japanese supports it .
the ministries claim that these are not bribes because the taxi drivers are not contracted by them , but by their staff .
but it will not help to dispel the suspicion that the officials running japan feel themselves to be above the law .

advertisement secret aid missions of ordinary burmese people burma 's state-run media has strongly condemned media reports of the devastation caused by cyclone nargis .
an article in a state daily accused " self-seekers " of faking video footage of the destruction - and foreign media of using it to harm burma 's image .
reports that survivors were living in dire conditions in the irrawaddy delta were exaggerated , it said .
burma 's leaders have been heavily criticised for their reluctance to accept help after the 2 may cyclone .
according to official figures , 78,000 people were killed and another 56,000 are missing .
more than two million people have been affected , aid agencies say .
after an initial refusal , the military junta is now allowing some experts from un agencies and south east asian neighbours to help victims of the storm .
but earlier this week us navy ships carrying much-needed helicopters and landing craft left burma 's coastline after 15 failed attempts to convince the regime to let them in .
' made-up stories ' some of the most shocking footage that has emerged from the storm-hit region has come from video shot by burmese amateurs and circulated on dvds .
burmese media labelled coverage of the cyclone as " despicable " in an article , the new light of myanmar condemned " self-seekers exploiting storm victims " .
they were , it said , " shooting video films featuring made-up stories in the storm-affected areas ... and sending the videotapes to foreign news agencies " .
" those foreign news agencies are issuing such groundless news stories with the intention of tarnishing the image of myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- and misleading the international community , " it said .
the daily also accused reporters of exaggerating the conditions in which victims were living , describing the coverage as " despicable and inhuman acts of local and foreign anti-government groups " .
burma is desperate to prove that it is in control of the relief effort and that it does not need large-scale foreign help , correspondents say .
it has done its utmost to prevent journalists entering the storm-hit region , setting up police checkpoints to stop people travelling into the area .
but aid agencies say they still do not have the unrestricted access they need to fully implement the kind of relief and reconstruction operation required .
the story came a day after burma 's most prominent comedian , zarganar , was detained after leading a private effort to deliver aid to cyclone victims .
many burmese volunteers have been organising their own deliveries to the delta to help people who have not received any aid .

advertisement secret aid missions of ordinary burmese people burma 's state-run media has strongly condemned media reports of the devastation caused by cyclone nargis .
an article in a state daily accused " self-seekers " of faking video footage of the destruction - and foreign media of using it to harm burma 's image .
reports that survivors were living in dire conditions in the irrawaddy delta were exaggerated , it said .
burma 's leaders have been heavily criticised for their reluctance to accept help after the 2 may cyclone .
according to official figures , 78,000 people were killed and another 56,000 are missing .
more than two million people have been affected , aid agencies say .
after an initial refusal , the military junta is now allowing some experts from un agencies and south east asian neighbours to help victims of the storm .
but earlier this week us navy ships carrying much-needed helicopters and landing craft left burma 's coastline after 15 failed attempts to convince the regime to let them in .
' made-up stories ' some of the most shocking footage that has emerged from the storm-hit region has come from video shot by burmese amateurs and circulated on dvds .
burmese media labelled coverage of the cyclone as " despicable " in an article , the new light of myanmar condemned " self-seekers exploiting storm victims " .
they were , it said , " shooting video films featuring made-up stories in the storm-affected areas ... and sending the videotapes to foreign news agencies " .
" those foreign news agencies are issuing such groundless news stories with the intention of tarnishing the image of myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- and misleading the international community , " it said .
the daily also accused reporters of exaggerating the conditions in which victims were living , describing the coverage as " despicable and inhuman acts of local and foreign anti-government groups " .
burma is desperate to prove that it is in control of the relief effort and that it does not need large-scale foreign help , correspondents say .
it has done its utmost to prevent journalists entering the storm-hit region , setting up police checkpoints to stop people travelling into the area .
but aid agencies say they still do not have the unrestricted access they need to fully implement the kind of relief and reconstruction operation required .
the story came a day after burma 's most prominent comedian , zarganar , was detained after leading a private effort to deliver aid to cyclone victims .
many burmese volunteers have been organising their own deliveries to the delta to help people who have not received any aid .

opponents want services improved at the royal cornwall hospital in truro rather than centralised in plymouth .
campaigners are worried about the distances patients will have to travel .
four of cornwall 's mps will meet the chief executive of the royal cornwall hospitals trust and the chairman to discuss the plans .
rare tumours surgery for upper gastro-intestinal cancer services is currently carried out at the royal cornwall hospital in truro .
but cornwall 's primary care trust is proposing a move to derriford hospital in plymouth .
health chiefs said making use of specialist cancer centres such as derriford for rare tumours which required complex operations would increase the life expectancy of patients .
but protesters said if surgery was transferred elsewhere , it could mean some patients and relatives would have to travel hundreds of miles .
the possibility of moving treatment for head and neck cancer and some complex gynaecological conditions to plymouth will be discussed at a later date .

professor alan smithers said the new diplomas could undermine educational standards and fail to prepare teenagers for university or work .
diplomas , which combine academic and practical learning , will be rolled out in england 's schools from september .
ministers said they had won support from employers , schools and experts .
the first five diplomas in media , health , construction , it and engineering will be taught to 20,000 teenagers from the next academic year .
another 12 diplomas will follow .
england 's children 's secretary , ed balls , has said they could replace a-levels as the qualification of choice .
' serious risk ' the university of buckingham academic argued in his report : " the diploma - a disaster waiting to happen " , that diplomas would not improve existing qualifications and had difficulties of their own .
the main problem was that their purpose was " confused " .
" it is trying to be all things to all people , " he said .
it is trying to create " parity of esteem for vocational and academic qualifications , to provide better routes to school , increase the numbers going to university and improve a-levels " , he added this also meant it was " not clear what the diploma is supposed to qualify for " .
" it is extremely doubtful whether the same qualification can be fit for the wide range of purposes that need to be served such as university entrance and recruitment to different levels in employment , " he said .
he added : " in going for an all-embracing framework it seems that there is a serious risk of necessary specificity being lost . "
prof smithers also sounded a warning over the fact that diplomas are to be mainly assessed internally , rather than marked externally as a-levels are . "
the diploma has garnered widespread backing from employers , universities , schools , colleges and education experts " jim knight schools minister " internal assessment is likely to mean that diplomas are of a very variable standard , not only between subjects but also within them , " he said .
" with a-levels , strenuous efforts are made to ensure both comparability between qualifications and consistency over time , but even they are not perfect . "
and the report suggested pupils will be able to gain the diploma without having to do any work experience in the field they are studying .
for example , someone on a construction and built environment course may not set foot on a construcion site .
schools minister jim knight rejected the study , which he described as " one-sided " .
" the diploma has garnered widespread backing from employers , universities , schools , colleges and education experts , " he said .
" its popularity continues to grow , with over 100 universities now endorsing it , a huge range of employers involved in delivering it , and over three quarters of schools and colleges now accepted to teach it .
" learners and parents are beginning to see that support and that diplomas offer a good stepping stone to employment , either directly or via university or apprenticeship . "
' flawed model ' he stressed that the advanced diploma for sixth-formers would be worth the equivalent of three and a half a-levels for teenagers applying to university .
he also said there would be a balance between controlled internal and external assessment , similar to gcses .
john dunford , general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , told the bbc 's today programme that the addition of three new diplomas would strengthen the reputation of the overall qualification .
" what is certain is that by having diplomas in science , languages and humanities , which are key areas of study for young people , that the diploma system is being broadened into these important areas , " he said .
" what that does , is it reduces the chance of diplomas becoming a second-class qualification , in the way that so many vocational qualifications have become in this country , regrettably , over the years . "
' point missed ' the shadow secretary for children , schools and families , michael gove , accused ed balls of " playing politics with the diploma , trying to use it as a way of undermining the a-level " .
" his failure to deliver has meant the number taking his new exam has halved , with schools , universities and employers all concerned that once again vocational education has been neglected , " said mr gove .
liberal democrat schools spokesman david laws said : " ministers are creating a complex qualifications maze which is likely to be a massive failure .
" the government must change this flawed diploma model completely , or it will be forced to accept the biggest qualifications flop in recent history . "
nut acting general secretary christine blower said prof smithers had missed the point in his report .

professor alan smithers said the new diplomas could undermine educational standards and fail to prepare teenagers for university or work .
diplomas , which combine academic and practical learning , will be rolled out in england 's schools from september .
ministers said they had won support from employers , schools and experts .
the first five diplomas in media , health , construction , it and engineering will be taught to 20,000 teenagers from the next academic year .
another 12 diplomas will follow .
england 's children 's secretary , ed balls , has said they could replace a-levels as the qualification of choice .
' serious risk ' the university of buckingham academic argued in his report : " the diploma - a disaster waiting to happen " , that diplomas would not improve existing qualifications and had difficulties of their own .
the main problem was that their purpose was " confused " .
" it is trying to be all things to all people , " he said .
it is trying to create " parity of esteem for vocational and academic qualifications , to provide better routes to school , increase the numbers going to university and improve a-levels " , he added this also meant it was " not clear what the diploma is supposed to qualify for " .
" it is extremely doubtful whether the same qualification can be fit for the wide range of purposes that need to be served such as university entrance and recruitment to different levels in employment , " he said .
he added : " in going for an all-embracing framework it seems that there is a serious risk of necessary specificity being lost . "
prof smithers also sounded a warning over the fact that diplomas are to be mainly assessed internally , rather than marked externally as a-levels are .
the diploma has garnered widespread backing from employers , universities , schools , colleges and education experts jim knight schools minister " internal assessment is likely to mean that diplomas are of a very variable standard , not only between subjects but also within them , " he said .
" with a-levels , strenuous efforts are made to ensure both comparability between qualifications and consistency over time , but even they are not perfect . "
and the report suggested pupils will be able to gain the diploma without having to do any work experience in the field they are studying .
for example , someone on a construction and built environment course may not set foot on a construcion site .
schools minister jim knight rejected the study , which he described as " one-sided " .
" the diploma has garnered widespread backing from employers , universities , schools , colleges and education experts , " he said .
" its popularity continues to grow , with over 100 universities now endorsing it , a huge range of employers involved in delivering it , and over three quarters of schools and colleges now accepted to teach it .
" learners and parents are beginning to see that support and that diplomas offer a good stepping stone to employment , either directly or via university or apprenticeship . "
' flawed model ' he stressed that the advanced diploma for sixth-formers would be worth the equivalent of three and a half a-levels for teenagers applying to university .
he also said there would be a balance between controlled internal and external assessment , similar to gcses .
john dunford , general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , told the bbc 's today programme that the addition of three new diplomas would strengthen the reputation of the overall qualification .
" what is certain is that by having diplomas in science , languages and humanities , which are key areas of study for young people , that the diploma system is being broadened into these important areas , " he said .
" what that does , is it reduces the chance of diplomas becoming a second-class qualification , in the way that so many vocational qualifications have become in this country , regrettably , over the years . "
' point missed ' the shadow secretary for children , schools and families , michael gove , accused ed balls of " playing politics with the diploma , trying to use it as a way of undermining the a-level " .
" his failure to deliver has meant the number taking his new exam has halved , with schools , universities and employers all concerned that once again vocational education has been neglected , " said mr gove .
liberal democrat schools spokesman david laws said : " ministers are creating a complex qualifications maze which is likely to be a massive failure .
" the government must change this flawed diploma model completely , or it will be forced to accept the biggest qualifications flop in recent history . "
nut acting general secretary christine blower said prof smithers had missed the point in his report .
" teachers support diplomas but they are deeply concerned about the operational implications of their introduction .

ministers said they had won support from employers , schools and experts .
the first five diplomas in media , health , construction , it and engineering will be taught to 20,000 teenagers from the next academic year .
another 12 diplomas will follow .
england 's children 's secretary , ed balls , has said they could replace a-levels as the qualification of choice .
' serious risk ' the university of buckingham academic argued in his report : " the diploma - a disaster waiting to happen " , that diplomas would not improve existing qualifications and had difficulties of their own .
the main problem was that their purpose was " confused " .
" it is trying to be all things to all people , " he said .
it is trying to create " parity of esteem for vocational and academic qualifications , to provide better routes to school , increase the numbers going to university and improve a-levels " , he added this also meant it was " not clear what the diploma is supposed to qualify for " .
" it is extremely doubtful whether the same qualification can be fit for the wide range of purposes that need to be served such as university entrance and recruitment to different levels in employment , " he said .
he added : " in going for an all-embracing framework it seems that there is a serious risk of necessary specificity being lost . "
prof smithers also sounded a warning over the fact that diplomas are to be mainly assessed internally , rather than marked externally as a-levels are .
the diploma has garnered widespread backing from employers , universities , schools , colleges and education experts jim knight schools minister " internal assessment is likely to mean that diplomas are of a very variable standard , not only between subjects but also within them , " he said .
" with a-levels , strenuous efforts are made to ensure both comparability between qualifications and consistency over time , but even they are not perfect . "
and the report suggested pupils will be able to gain the diploma without having to do any work experience in the field they are studying .
for example , someone on a construction and built environment course may not set foot on a construcion site .
schools minister jim knight rejected the study , which he described as " one-sided " .
" the diploma has garnered widespread backing from employers , universities , schools , colleges and education experts , " he said .
" its popularity continues to grow , with over 100 universities now endorsing it , a huge range of employers involved in delivering it , and over three quarters of schools and colleges now accepted to teach it .
" learners and parents are beginning to see that support and that diplomas offer a good stepping stone to employment , either directly or via university or apprenticeship . "
' flawed model ' he stressed that the advanced diploma for sixth-formers would be worth the equivalent of three and a half a-levels for teenagers applying to university .
he also said there would be a balance between controlled internal and external assessment , similar to gcses .
john dunford , general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , told the bbc 's today programme that the addition of three new diplomas would strengthen the reputation of the overall qualification .
" what is certain is that by having diplomas in science , languages and humanities , which are key areas of study for young people , that the diploma system is being broadened into these important areas , " he said .
" what that does , is it reduces the chance of diplomas becoming a second-class qualification , in the way that so many vocational qualifications have become in this country , regrettably , over the years . "
' point missed ' the shadow secretary for children , schools and families , michael gove , accused ed balls of " playing politics with the diploma , trying to use it as a way of undermining the a-level " .
" his failure to deliver has meant the number taking his new exam has halved , with schools , universities and employers all concerned that once again vocational education has been neglected , " said mr gove .
liberal democrat schools spokesman david laws said : " ministers are creating a complex qualifications maze which is likely to be a massive failure .
" the government must change this flawed diploma model completely , or it will be forced to accept the biggest qualifications flop in recent history . "
nut acting general secretary christine blower said prof smithers had missed the point in his report .
" teachers support diplomas but they are deeply concerned about the operational implications of their introduction .
" the first year of the diplomas should be seen as a pilot in which lessons are learnt , not as a fixed roll-out . "

professor alan smithers said the new diplomas could undermine educational standards and fail to prepare teenagers for university or work .
diplomas , which combine academic and practical learning , will be rolled out in england 's schools from september .
ministers said they had won support from employers , schools and experts .
the first five diplomas in media , health , construction , it and engineering will be taught to 20,000 teenagers from the next academic year .
another 12 diplomas will follow .
england 's children 's secretary , ed balls , has said they could replace a-levels as the qualification of choice .
' serious risk ' the university of buckingham academic argued in his report : " the diploma - a disaster waiting to happen " , that diplomas would not improve existing qualifications and had difficulties of their own .
the main problem was that their purpose was " confused " .
" it is trying to be all things to all people , " he said .
it is trying to create " parity of esteem for vocational and academic qualifications , to provide better routes to school , increase the numbers going to university and improve a-levels " , he added this also meant it was " not clear what the diploma is supposed to qualify for " .
" it is extremely doubtful whether the same qualification can be fit for the wide range of purposes that need to be served such as university entrance and recruitment to different levels in employment , " he said .
he added : " in going for an all-embracing framework it seems that there is a serious risk of necessary specificity being lost . "
prof smithers also sounded a warning over the fact that diplomas are to be mainly assessed internally , rather than marked externally as a-levels are .
the diploma has garnered widespread backing from employers , universities , schools , colleges and education experts jim knight schools minister " internal assessment is likely to mean that diplomas are of a very variable standard , not only between subjects but also within them , " he said .
" with a-levels , strenuous efforts are made to ensure both comparability between qualifications and consistency over time , but even they are not perfect . "
and the report suggested pupils will be able to gain the diploma without having to do any work experience in the field they are studying .
for example , someone on a construction and built environment course may not set foot on a construcion site .

a new technique to find out has been developed at swansea university .
instead of blood tests , now all that is needed is a simple mouth swab .
the technique could aid studies into attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -lrb- adhd -rrb- and the effectiveness of chemotherapy at certain times .
the test indentifies genes that regulate sleep , and first test samples were taken on thursday at a science festival .
the natural pattern of wake and sleep is known as the circadian rhythm .
a number of different genes control an individual 's circadian rhythm and the levels of ribonucleic acid -lrb- rna -rrb- produced by these different genes indicate how active they are at different times of day .
one gene known as per2 produces the highest levels of rna at about 4am , and is the gene associated with sleep .
the gene examined at the science festival in cheltenham produces its highest levels at about 4pm , is known as rev-erb and is thought by scientists to be associated with wakefulness . "
i would say i have become an early riser , i 've had to discipline and condition myself to it and that means i have had to make sacrifices " stephen chant , royal mail manager samples were taken before and after a talk at the festival and are being analysed by the swansea researchers .
the results will be made available to individuals online .
sarah forbes-robertson , a research fellow at swansea university , said if a person produces higher levels of rev-erb before 4pm they are likely to be an early bird .
if someone produces higher levels after 4pm they are likely to be a night owl .
paul barnett , a freelance music promoter from cardiff , said he had always been a natural night owl and would be even if he worked in a job without so many late nights .
" i get up at around 9 or 9.30 and do n't go to bed until 1am .
it 's always been this way and it drives me mad ! " he said .
" one of my former relationships was with a teacher and she went to bed at 11pm but i was never tired enough .
it had an impact on the relationship . "
sleep pattern early riser stephen chant , a royal mail delivery office manager in cardiff , said he has never got used to the early morning starts required in his job but he is in a pattern .
" i still wake up early in the morning at the weekend and it drives my wife potty , " he explained .
" i would say i have become an early riser .
i 've had to discipline and condition myself to it and that means i have had to make sacrifices like not having a drink - even a pint - in the week . "
" it has been suggested that chemotherapy for cancer patients may be far more effective if administered at certain times of the day .
our techniques might be able to confirm this and explain why " sarah forbes-robertson , swansea university scientists believe the swab technique will open up their field of research because the individuals tested can continue with their normal day and night activities .
previously samples would need to be taken every four hours over a full day and night .
it will also allow researchers to assess whether jet lag cures , like melatonin tablets , actually do anything to alter gene expression .
" gene expression can be altered by external factors , such as jet lag , " said ms forbes-robertson .
" one interesting finding is that food affects gene expression .
so , after lunch , per2 has a small peak , leading to that post lunch slump , " she noted .

instead of blood tests , now all that is needed is a simple mouth swab .
the technique could aid studies into attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -lrb- adhd -rrb- and the effectiveness of chemotherapy at certain times .
the test indentifies genes that regulate sleep , and first test samples were taken on thursday at a science festival .
the natural pattern of wake and sleep is known as the circadian rhythm .
a number of different genes control an individual 's circadian rhythm and the levels of ribonucleic acid -lrb- rna -rrb- produced by these different genes indicate how active they are at different times of day .
one gene known as per2 produces the highest levels of rna at about 4am , and is the gene associated with sleep .
the gene examined at the science festival in cheltenham produces its highest levels at about 4pm , is known as rev-erb and is thought by scientists to be associated with wakefulness .
i would say i have become an early riser , i 've had to discipline and condition myself to it and that means i have had to make sacrifices stephen chant , royal mail manager samples were taken before and after a talk at the festival and are being analysed by the swansea researchers .
the results will be made available to individuals online .
sarah forbes-robertson , a research fellow at swansea university , said if a person produces higher levels of rev-erb before 4pm they are likely to be an early bird .
if someone produces higher levels after 4pm they are likely to be a night owl .
paul barnett , a freelance music promoter from cardiff , said he had always been a natural night owl and would be even if he worked in a job without so many late nights .
" i get up at around 9 or 9.30 and do n't go to bed until 1am .
it 's always been this way and it drives me mad ! " he said .
" one of my former relationships was with a teacher and she went to bed at 11pm but i was never tired enough .
it had an impact on the relationship . "
sleep pattern early riser stephen chant , a royal mail delivery office manager in cardiff , said he has never got used to the early morning starts required in his job but he is in a pattern .
" i still wake up early in the morning at the weekend and it drives my wife potty , " he explained .
" i would say i have become an early riser .
i 've had to discipline and condition myself to it and that means i have had to make sacrifices like not having a drink - even a pint - in the week . "
it has been suggested that chemotherapy for cancer patients may be far more effective if administered at certain times of the day .
our techniques might be able to confirm this and explain why sarah forbes-robertson , swansea university scientists believe the swab technique will open up their field of research because the individuals tested can continue with their normal day and night activities .
previously samples would need to be taken every four hours over a full day and night .
it will also allow researchers to assess whether jet lag cures , like melatonin tablets , actually do anything to alter gene expression .
" gene expression can be altered by external factors , such as jet lag , " said ms forbes-robertson .
" one interesting finding is that food affects gene expression .
so , after lunch , per2 has a small peak , leading to that post lunch slump , " she noted .
