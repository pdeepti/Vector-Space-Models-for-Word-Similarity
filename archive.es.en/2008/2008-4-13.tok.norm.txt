yet a new study shows that focusing on spirituality could win them back . a dozen teenagers hung out at the lengsdorf neighborhood 's youth center on a recent cold spring evening .
some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .
the center , in a middle class neighborhood in the western german city of bonn , sits just across the street from lengsdorf 's graceful st. petri church and uses a couple of basement rooms in a parish building .
but you wo n't find these teenagers in the pews come sunday morning .
like many german youth , they 're completely uninterested in organized religion .
both desiree , 17 , and laura , 15 , who did n't want to give their last names , identified themselves as protestants and said they willingly went through three years of confirmation classes , although desiree admitted she did it " only for the presents . "
while they both expressed an interest in spiritual themes , they do n't consider themselves religious .
desiree never goes to church and laura only attends at christmas .
" most of the people i know who are protestant do n't believe in god , " desiree said .
" i do n't believe in god because i think it makes for lazy thinking .
i think religion is something people made up . "
what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .
" i believe that people are reincarnated .
i 've seen reports where people talked about their experiences in past lives and it seemed very believable , " desiree said .
" but you 're heart does n't keep beating after you die .

hierarchy and rules : very uncool while many young germans reject church , steffen hauff does n't believe that they have rejected god .
most of his 20-something peers might skip sunday morning services or frown on traditional christian views on sexuality .
but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .
teens question tradition hauff said he does n't think the goal should be filling the church pews with young people .
" it 's not important that people are only in church for two hours on sunday mornings .
the important thing is everyday parish life ; that they spend time together and help each other , " hauff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teens disagree with church doctrine on sexuality yet while it is often easy to convince teens to attend fun events like world youth day , it should also include a deeper relationship with god , religion and the church , said sigrid grabmeier .

what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .

but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .
" but during the course of this season we got the impression the team was n't developing further .
we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently . " midfielder jermaine jones , who joined schalke at the beginning of the season , also told dpa : " since my first day of training in the summer , slomka has been criticized .
it 's something i never really understood . " the bild am sonntag newspaper reported that the team has three candidates for the coveted jobs : fred rutten from twente enschede , eric gerets from olympique marseille and dick advocaat from zenit st. petersburg . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .
" but during the course of this season we got the impression the team was n't developing further .
we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently . " midfielder jermaine jones , who joined schalke at the beginning of the season , also told dpa : " since my first day of training in the summer , slomka has been criticized .
it 's something i never really understood . " the bild am sonntag newspaper reported that the team has three candidates for the coveted jobs : fred rutten from twente enschede , eric gerets from olympique marseille and dick advocaat from zenit st. petersburg . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely . in the end , the stir caused by the social democratic party 's move to illegalize the far-right national democratic party only helps the npd , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told the newspaper schleswig-holstein am sonntag in its sunday , april 13 , edition . he said the party is " clearly unconstitutional " but that germany 's basic law was very cautious about outlawing political parties . " the worst thing would be another failed ban proposal , " said schaeuble , who will discuss the matter later this week at a conference with germany 's 16 state interior ministers . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out due to problems with undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet . the spd , which is a partner in chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition , has n't garnered support for the ban from other parties but has nevertheless continued to press for one . merkel speaks out against extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first ban proposal was stopped when some party leaders were found to be undercover agents in a separate interview published sunday by the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , merkel expressed doubts over the success of a second ban effort .

" this party and the entire right-wing extremist movement have to be confronted resolutely , " she said .
" ' nip it in the bud ' is my personal conviction . " hamburg 's state interior minister udo nagel , who does n't represent a political party , told the ap news agency that " all the ministers want the npd to be banned " but that a ban simply was n't " legally or factually possible .

german cabinet ministers are not in complete agreement over how much biofuels are to blame for food problems . dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund , warned of dire consequences for people in developing countries should food prices remain high . " thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington . skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti . some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits . call for reconsideration of biofuel goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants biofuels to cover 10 percent of its transportation needs by 2020 it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said saturday in a statement prior to the imf meeting . " the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " eu leaders agreed last year to obtain a tenth of all transport fuel from biofuels by the year 2020 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting climate change . biofuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which are refined into ethanol or oil .
they are used as an environmental friendly alternative to gasoline and diesel as they release lower quantities of co2 when burned .
both europe and the us subsidize biofuel production . food or fodder ? but also on saturday , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel downplayed the effect biofuels have had on global food prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said fodder prices have also been rising " we can meet the 10 percent target through biofuel production in the european union -lsb- and imports of -rsb- raw materials , which do not lead to a conflict with food or rainforests , " gabriel told reporters saturday on the sidelines of an eu environment meeting in slovenia . " the big competition is not between the use of biomass for energy and food but between feed and food , " said gabriel .
" the consequences of the growing demand for meat and milk are that more land is used for fodder , and this development is just made worse by the biofuels . " according to the food and agriculture organization , 37 countries currently face food crises .
the world bank , an institution tasked with fighting poverty , is to continue food shortage discussions at a meeting in washington on sunday . world bank president robert zoellick has urged countries to immediately provide the minimum $ 500 million sought to allay the shortage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely . in the end , the stir caused by the social democratic party 's move to illegalize the far-right national democratic party only helps the npd , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told the newspaper schleswig-holstein am sonntag in its sunday , april 13 , edition . he said the party is " clearly unconstitutional " but that germany 's basic law was very cautious about outlawing political parties . " the worst thing would be another failed ban proposal , " said schaeuble , who will discuss the matter later this week at a conference with germany 's 16 state interior ministers . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out due to problems with undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet . the spd , which is a partner in chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition , has n't garnered support for the ban from other parties but has nevertheless continued to press for one . merkel speaks out against extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first ban proposal was stopped when some party leaders were found to be undercover agents in a separate interview published sunday by the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , merkel expressed doubts over the success of a second ban effort . " i 'm waiting for the opinion of the interior ministers , whose experts have been very skeptical so far , " said the chancellor , who did n't mince words when it came to right-wing extremism in general . " this party and the entire right-wing extremist movement have to be confronted resolutely , " she said .
" ' nip it in the bud ' is my personal conviction . " hamburg 's state interior minister udo nagel , who does n't represent a political party , told the ap news agency that " all the ministers want the npd to be banned " but that a ban simply was n't " legally or factually possible . " germany 's state interior ministers are set to discuss the matter at their spring conference to be held from april 16-18 in brandenburg . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely . in the end , the stir caused by the social democratic party 's move to illegalize the far-right national democratic party only helps the npd , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told the newspaper schleswig-holstein am sonntag in its sunday , april 13 , edition . he said the party is " clearly unconstitutional " but that germany 's basic law was very cautious about outlawing political parties . " the worst thing would be another failed ban proposal , " said schaeuble , who will discuss the matter later this week at a conference with germany 's 16 state interior ministers . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out due to problems with undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet . the spd , which is a partner in chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition , has n't garnered support for the ban from other parties but has nevertheless continued to press for one . merkel speaks out against extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first ban proposal was stopped when some party leaders were found to be undercover agents in a separate interview published sunday by the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , merkel expressed doubts over the success of a second ban effort . " i 'm waiting for the opinion of the interior ministers , whose experts have been very skeptical so far , " said the chancellor , who did n't mince words when it came to right-wing extremism in general . " this party and the entire right-wing extremist movement have to be confronted resolutely , " she said .
" ' nip it in the bud ' is my personal conviction . " hamburg 's state interior minister udo nagel , who does n't represent a political party , told the ap news agency that " all the ministers want the npd to be banned " but that a ban simply was n't " legally or factually possible . " germany 's state interior ministers are set to discuss the matter at their spring conference to be held from april 16-18 in brandenburg . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german cabinet ministers are not in complete agreement over how much biofuels are to blame for food problems . dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund , warned of dire consequences for people in developing countries should food prices remain high . " thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington . skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti . some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits . call for reconsideration of biofuel goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants biofuels to cover 10 percent of its transportation needs by 2020 it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said saturday in a statement prior to the imf meeting . " the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " eu leaders agreed last year to obtain a tenth of all transport fuel from biofuels by the year 2020 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting climate change . biofuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which are refined into ethanol or oil .
they are used as an environmental friendly alternative to gasoline and diesel as they release lower quantities of co2 when burned .
both europe and the us subsidize biofuel production . food or fodder ? but also on saturday , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel downplayed the effect biofuels have had on global food prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said fodder prices have also been rising " we can meet the 10 percent target through biofuel production in the european union -lsb- and imports of -rsb- raw materials , which do not lead to a conflict with food or rainforests , " gabriel told reporters saturday on the sidelines of an eu environment meeting in slovenia . " the big competition is not between the use of biomass for energy and food but between feed and food , " said gabriel .
" the consequences of the growing demand for meat and milk are that more land is used for fodder , and this development is just made worse by the biofuels . " according to the food and agriculture organization , 37 countries currently face food crises .
the world bank , an institution tasked with fighting poverty , is to continue food shortage discussions at a meeting in washington on sunday . world bank president robert zoellick has urged countries to immediately provide the minimum $ 500 million sought to allay the shortage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german cabinet ministers are not in complete agreement over how much biofuels are to blame for food problems . dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund , warned of dire consequences for people in developing countries should food prices remain high . " thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington . skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti . some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .

" the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " eu leaders agreed last year to obtain a tenth of all transport fuel from biofuels by the year 2020 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting climate change . biofuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which are refined into ethanol or oil .
they are used as an environmental friendly alternative to gasoline and diesel as they release lower quantities of co2 when burned .
both europe and the us subsidize biofuel production . food or fodder ? but also on saturday , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel downplayed the effect biofuels have had on global food prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said fodder prices have also been rising " we can meet the 10 percent target through biofuel production in the european union -lsb- and imports of -rsb- raw materials , which do not lead to a conflict with food or rainforests , " gabriel told reporters saturday on the sidelines of an eu environment meeting in slovenia . " the big competition is not between the use of biomass for energy and food but between feed and food , " said gabriel .
" the consequences of the growing demand for meat and milk are that more land is used for fodder , and this development is just made worse by the biofuels . " according to the food and agriculture organization , 37 countries currently face food crises .
the world bank , an institution tasked with fighting poverty , is to continue food shortage discussions at a meeting in washington on sunday . world bank president robert zoellick has urged countries to immediately provide the minimum $ 500 million sought to allay the shortage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but things can change . wagner 's spokesman peter emmerich , however , confirmed that the director-for-life had this week submitted a letter expressing his intention to retire to the board of the bayreuth festival . emmerich also said that wagner could now imagine a co-directorship involving both daughters .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .

we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently . " midfielder jermaine jones , who joined schalke at the beginning of the season , also told dpa : " since my first day of training in the summer , slomka has been criticized .
it 's something i never really understood .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .
" but during the course of this season we got the impression the team was n't developing further .
we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently . " midfielder jermaine jones , who joined schalke at the beginning of the season , also told dpa : " since my first day of training in the summer , slomka has been criticized .
it 's something i never really understood . " the bild am sonntag newspaper reported that the team has three candidates for the coveted jobs : fred rutten from twente enschede , eric gerets from olympique marseille and dick advocaat from zenit st. petersburg . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely . in the end , the stir caused by the social democratic party 's move to illegalize the far-right national democratic party only helps the npd , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told the newspaper schleswig-holstein am sonntag in its sunday , april 13 , edition . he said the party is " clearly unconstitutional " but that germany 's basic law was very cautious about outlawing political parties . " the worst thing would be another failed ban proposal , " said schaeuble , who will discuss the matter later this week at a conference with germany 's 16 state interior ministers . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out due to problems with undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet . the spd , which is a partner in chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition , has n't garnered support for the ban from other parties but has nevertheless continued to press for one . merkel speaks out against extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first ban proposal was stopped when some party leaders were found to be undercover agents in a separate interview published sunday by the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , merkel expressed doubts over the success of a second ban effort .

" ' nip it in the bud ' is my personal conviction .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy agriculture -pipe- 13.04.2008 biofuels linked to soaring food prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high food prices have led to riots in the developing world debate continues to rage over food shortages , rising costs and the link to biofuel production .
german cabinet ministers are not in complete agreement over how much biofuels are to blame for food problems . dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund , warned of dire consequences for people in developing countries should food prices remain high . " thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington . skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti . some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits . call for reconsideration of biofuel goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants biofuels to cover 10 percent of its transportation needs by 2020 it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said saturday in a statement prior to the imf meeting . " the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " eu leaders agreed last year to obtain a tenth of all transport fuel from biofuels by the year 2020 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting climate change . biofuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which are refined into ethanol or oil .

yet a new study shows that focusing on spirituality could win them back . a dozen teenagers hung out at the lengsdorf neighborhood 's youth center on a recent cold spring evening .
some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .
the center , in a middle class neighborhood in the western german city of bonn , sits just across the street from lengsdorf 's graceful st. petri church and uses a couple of basement rooms in a parish building .
but you wo n't find these teenagers in the pews come sunday morning .
like many german youth , they 're completely uninterested in organized religion .
both desiree , 17 , and laura , 15 , who did n't want to give their last names , identified themselves as protestants and said they willingly went through three years of confirmation classes , although desiree admitted she did it " only for the presents . "
while they both expressed an interest in spiritual themes , they do n't consider themselves religious .
desiree never goes to church and laura only attends at christmas .
" most of the people i know who are protestant do n't believe in god , " desiree said .
" i do n't believe in god because i think it makes for lazy thinking .
i think religion is something people made up . "
what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .
" i believe that people are reincarnated .
i 've seen reports where people talked about their experiences in past lives and it seemed very believable , " desiree said .
" but you 're heart does n't keep beating after you die .
i ca n't imagine it , " laura countered .
hierarchy and rules : very uncool while many young germans reject church , steffen hauff does n't believe that they have rejected god .
most of his 20-something peers might skip sunday morning services or frown on traditional christian views on sexuality .
but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .
teens question tradition hauff said he does n't think the goal should be filling the church pews with young people .
" it 's not important that people are only in church for two hours on sunday mornings .
the important thing is everyday parish life ; that they spend time together and help each other , " hauff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teens disagree with church doctrine on sexuality yet while it is often easy to convince teens to attend fun events like world youth day , it should also include a deeper relationship with god , religion and the church , said sigrid grabmeier .
teens usually are n't interested in more serious commitment , said grabmeier , of germany 's we are church , a group advocating reform of the roman catholic church .
most teens are turned off from church because there are " so many rules they do n't understand and do n't agree with , " grabmeier said .
few are willing to become actively involved in trying to bring about change .
yet grabmeier sees the youthful desire to question orthodox beliefs as healthy .
even her teenage sons , while religious , opted to take ethics at school because they felt it was important to expand their own understanding of the world .
" i find it interesting , " grabmeier said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .

yet a new study shows that focusing on spirituality could win them back . a dozen teenagers hung out at the lengsdorf neighborhood 's youth center on a recent cold spring evening .
some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .
the center , in a middle class neighborhood in the western german city of bonn , sits just across the street from lengsdorf 's graceful st. petri church and uses a couple of basement rooms in a parish building .
but you wo n't find these teenagers in the pews come sunday morning .
like many german youth , they 're completely uninterested in organized religion .
both desiree , 17 , and laura , 15 , who did n't want to give their last names , identified themselves as protestants and said they willingly went through three years of confirmation classes , although desiree admitted she did it " only for the presents . "
while they both expressed an interest in spiritual themes , they do n't consider themselves religious .
desiree never goes to church and laura only attends at christmas .
" most of the people i know who are protestant do n't believe in god , " desiree said .
" i do n't believe in god because i think it makes for lazy thinking .
i think religion is something people made up . "
what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .
" i believe that people are reincarnated .
i 've seen reports where people talked about their experiences in past lives and it seemed very believable , " desiree said .
" but you 're heart does n't keep beating after you die .
i ca n't imagine it , " laura countered .
hierarchy and rules : very uncool while many young germans reject church , steffen hauff does n't believe that they have rejected god .
most of his 20-something peers might skip sunday morning services or frown on traditional christian views on sexuality .
but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .
teens question tradition hauff said he does n't think the goal should be filling the church pews with young people .
" it 's not important that people are only in church for two hours on sunday mornings .
the important thing is everyday parish life ; that they spend time together and help each other , " hauff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teens disagree with church doctrine on sexuality yet while it is often easy to convince teens to attend fun events like world youth day , it should also include a deeper relationship with god , religion and the church , said sigrid grabmeier .
teens usually are n't interested in more serious commitment , said grabmeier , of germany 's we are church , a group advocating reform of the roman catholic church .
most teens are turned off from church because there are " so many rules they do n't understand and do n't agree with , " grabmeier said .
few are willing to become actively involved in trying to bring about change .
yet grabmeier sees the youthful desire to question orthodox beliefs as healthy .
even her teenage sons , while religious , opted to take ethics at school because they felt it was important to expand their own understanding of the world .
" i find it interesting , " grabmeier said .
" they were quite fed up with only seeing -lsb- religion -rsb- from a christian perspective . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.04.2008 youthful german skeptics challenge religious convention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'd rather be dancing than praying a generation of young germans has turned its back on organized religion , finding the church outdated and irrelevant .
yet a new study shows that focusing on spirituality could win them back . a dozen teenagers hung out at the lengsdorf neighborhood 's youth center on a recent cold spring evening .
some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .
the center , in a middle class neighborhood in the western german city of bonn , sits just across the street from lengsdorf 's graceful st. petri church and uses a couple of basement rooms in a parish building .
but you wo n't find these teenagers in the pews come sunday morning .
like many german youth , they 're completely uninterested in organized religion .
both desiree , 17 , and laura , 15 , who did n't want to give their last names , identified themselves as protestants and said they willingly went through three years of confirmation classes , although desiree admitted she did it " only for the presents . "
while they both expressed an interest in spiritual themes , they do n't consider themselves religious .
desiree never goes to church and laura only attends at christmas .
" most of the people i know who are protestant do n't believe in god , " desiree said .
" i do n't believe in god because i think it makes for lazy thinking .
i think religion is something people made up . "
what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .
" i believe that people are reincarnated .
i 've seen reports where people talked about their experiences in past lives and it seemed very believable , " desiree said .
" but you 're heart does n't keep beating after you die .
i ca n't imagine it , " laura countered .
hierarchy and rules : very uncool while many young germans reject church , steffen hauff does n't believe that they have rejected god .
most of his 20-something peers might skip sunday morning services or frown on traditional christian views on sexuality .
but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .
teens question tradition hauff said he does n't think the goal should be filling the church pews with young people .
" it 's not important that people are only in church for two hours on sunday mornings .
the important thing is everyday parish life ; that they spend time together and help each other , " hauff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teens disagree with church doctrine on sexuality yet while it is often easy to convince teens to attend fun events like world youth day , it should also include a deeper relationship with god , religion and the church , said sigrid grabmeier .
teens usually are n't interested in more serious commitment , said grabmeier , of germany 's we are church , a group advocating reform of the roman catholic church .
most teens are turned off from church because there are " so many rules they do n't understand and do n't agree with , " grabmeier said .
few are willing to become actively involved in trying to bring about change .
yet grabmeier sees the youthful desire to question orthodox beliefs as healthy .
even her teenage sons , while religious , opted to take ethics at school because they felt it was important to expand their own understanding of the world .
" i find it interesting , " grabmeier said .
" they were quite fed up with only seeing -lsb- religion -rsb- from a christian perspective . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .

we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently . " midfielder jermaine jones , who joined schalke at the beginning of the season , also told dpa : " since my first day of training in the summer , slomka has been criticized .
it 's something i never really understood .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .
" but during the course of this season we got the impression the team was n't developing further .
we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently . " midfielder jermaine jones , who joined schalke at the beginning of the season , also told dpa : " since my first day of training in the summer , slomka has been criticized .
it 's something i never really understood .

yet a new study shows that focusing on spirituality could win them back . a dozen teenagers hung out at the lengsdorf neighborhood 's youth center on a recent cold spring evening .
some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .
the center , in a middle class neighborhood in the western german city of bonn , sits just across the street from lengsdorf 's graceful st. petri church and uses a couple of basement rooms in a parish building .
but you wo n't find these teenagers in the pews come sunday morning .
like many german youth , they 're completely uninterested in organized religion .
both desiree , 17 , and laura , 15 , who did n't want to give their last names , identified themselves as protestants and said they willingly went through three years of confirmation classes , although desiree admitted she did it " only for the presents . "
while they both expressed an interest in spiritual themes , they do n't consider themselves religious .
desiree never goes to church and laura only attends at christmas .
" most of the people i know who are protestant do n't believe in god , " desiree said .
" i do n't believe in god because i think it makes for lazy thinking .

what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .
" i believe that people are reincarnated .
i 've seen reports where people talked about their experiences in past lives and it seemed very believable , " desiree said .
" but you 're heart does n't keep beating after you die .

hierarchy and rules : very uncool while many young germans reject church , steffen hauff does n't believe that they have rejected god .
most of his 20-something peers might skip sunday morning services or frown on traditional christian views on sexuality .
but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .
teens question tradition hauff said he does n't think the goal should be filling the church pews with young people .
" it 's not important that people are only in church for two hours on sunday mornings .
the important thing is everyday parish life ; that they spend time together and help each other , " hauff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teens disagree with church doctrine on sexuality yet while it is often easy to convince teens to attend fun events like world youth day , it should also include a deeper relationship with god , religion and the church , said sigrid grabmeier .

most teens are turned off from church because there are " so many rules they do n't understand and do n't agree with , " grabmeier said .
few are willing to become actively involved in trying to bring about change .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .

" the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently .

the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely . in the end , the stir caused by the social democratic party 's move to illegalize the far-right national democratic party only helps the npd , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told the newspaper schleswig-holstein am sonntag in its sunday , april 13 , edition . he said the party is " clearly unconstitutional " but that germany 's basic law was very cautious about outlawing political parties . " the worst thing would be another failed ban proposal , " said schaeuble , who will discuss the matter later this week at a conference with germany 's 16 state interior ministers . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out due to problems with undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet . the spd , which is a partner in chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition , has n't garnered support for the ban from other parties but has nevertheless continued to press for one . merkel speaks out against extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first ban proposal was stopped when some party leaders were found to be undercover agents in a separate interview published sunday by the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , merkel expressed doubts over the success of a second ban effort .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said .

" slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- .

" the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently .

it 's something i never really understood .

" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington . skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti . some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .

" the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " eu leaders agreed last year to obtain a tenth of all transport fuel from biofuels by the year 2020 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting climate change . biofuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which are refined into ethanol or oil .
they are used as an environmental friendly alternative to gasoline and diesel as they release lower quantities of co2 when burned .

" the big competition is not between the use of biomass for energy and food but between feed and food , " said gabriel .
" the consequences of the growing demand for meat and milk are that more land is used for fodder , and this development is just made worse by the biofuels . " according to the food and agriculture organization , 37 countries currently face food crises .
the world bank , an institution tasked with fighting poverty , is to continue food shortage discussions at a meeting in washington on sunday . world bank president robert zoellick has urged countries to immediately provide the minimum $ 500 million sought to allay the shortage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german cabinet ministers are not in complete agreement over how much biofuels are to blame for food problems . dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund , warned of dire consequences for people in developing countries should food prices remain high . " thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington . skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti . some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits . call for reconsideration of biofuel goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants biofuels to cover 10 percent of its transportation needs by 2020 it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said saturday in a statement prior to the imf meeting . " the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " eu leaders agreed last year to obtain a tenth of all transport fuel from biofuels by the year 2020 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting climate change . biofuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which are refined into ethanol or oil .
they are used as an environmental friendly alternative to gasoline and diesel as they release lower quantities of co2 when burned .
both europe and the us subsidize biofuel production . food or fodder ? but also on saturday , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel downplayed the effect biofuels have had on global food prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said fodder prices have also been rising " we can meet the 10 percent target through biofuel production in the european union -lsb- and imports of -rsb- raw materials , which do not lead to a conflict with food or rainforests , " gabriel told reporters saturday on the sidelines of an eu environment meeting in slovenia . " the big competition is not between the use of biomass for energy and food but between feed and food , " said gabriel .
" the consequences of the growing demand for meat and milk are that more land is used for fodder , and this development is just made worse by the biofuels . " according to the food and agriculture organization , 37 countries currently face food crises .
the world bank , an institution tasked with fighting poverty , is to continue food shortage discussions at a meeting in washington on sunday . world bank president robert zoellick has urged countries to immediately provide the minimum $ 500 million sought to allay the shortage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet a new study shows that focusing on spirituality could win them back . a dozen teenagers hung out at the lengsdorf neighborhood 's youth center on a recent cold spring evening .
some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .
the center , in a middle class neighborhood in the western german city of bonn , sits just across the street from lengsdorf 's graceful st. petri church and uses a couple of basement rooms in a parish building .
but you wo n't find these teenagers in the pews come sunday morning .
like many german youth , they 're completely uninterested in organized religion .
both desiree , 17 , and laura , 15 , who did n't want to give their last names , identified themselves as protestants and said they willingly went through three years of confirmation classes , although desiree admitted she did it " only for the presents . "
while they both expressed an interest in spiritual themes , they do n't consider themselves religious .
desiree never goes to church and laura only attends at christmas .
" most of the people i know who are protestant do n't believe in god , " desiree said .
" i do n't believe in god because i think it makes for lazy thinking .
i think religion is something people made up . "
what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .
" i believe that people are reincarnated .
i 've seen reports where people talked about their experiences in past lives and it seemed very believable , " desiree said .
" but you 're heart does n't keep beating after you die .
i ca n't imagine it , " laura countered .
hierarchy and rules : very uncool while many young germans reject church , steffen hauff does n't believe that they have rejected god .
most of his 20-something peers might skip sunday morning services or frown on traditional christian views on sexuality .
but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .
teens question tradition hauff said he does n't think the goal should be filling the church pews with young people .
" it 's not important that people are only in church for two hours on sunday mornings .
the important thing is everyday parish life ; that they spend time together and help each other , " hauff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teens disagree with church doctrine on sexuality yet while it is often easy to convince teens to attend fun events like world youth day , it should also include a deeper relationship with god , religion and the church , said sigrid grabmeier .
teens usually are n't interested in more serious commitment , said grabmeier , of germany 's we are church , a group advocating reform of the roman catholic church .
most teens are turned off from church because there are " so many rules they do n't understand and do n't agree with , " grabmeier said .
few are willing to become actively involved in trying to bring about change .
yet grabmeier sees the youthful desire to question orthodox beliefs as healthy .
even her teenage sons , while religious , opted to take ethics at school because they felt it was important to expand their own understanding of the world .

" truancy can be the beginning of a criminal career and that 's why we have to intervene , " said nagel .
" not every truant becomes criminal , but criminals skipped school at one time or another . " youths who can not afford their own games play with consoles set up for demonstration purposes in city department stores and marts when they should be in school or at training courses . police suggested the consoles stay switched off every weekday until 3:00 pm , according to the report released saturday . the interior ministers of germany 's 16 states will discuss the proposal and other measures to fight youth crime at their spring conference in brandenburg on april 16-18 . dw staff with dpa news reports -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor said right-wing extremism should be " nipped in the bud " but a ban was unlikely . in the end , the stir caused by the social democratic party 's move to illegalize the far-right national democratic party only helps the npd , interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told the newspaper schleswig-holstein am sonntag in its sunday , april 13 , edition . he said the party is " clearly unconstitutional " but that germany 's basic law was very cautious about outlawing political parties . " the worst thing would be another failed ban proposal , " said schaeuble , who will discuss the matter later this week at a conference with germany 's 16 state interior ministers . the spd first attempted to push through an npd ban in 2003 , but germany 's high court threw the case out due to problems with undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet . the spd , which is a partner in chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition , has n't garnered support for the ban from other parties but has nevertheless continued to press for one . merkel speaks out against extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first ban proposal was stopped when some party leaders were found to be undercover agents in a separate interview published sunday by the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , merkel expressed doubts over the success of a second ban effort . " i 'm waiting for the opinion of the interior ministers , whose experts have been very skeptical so far , " said the chancellor , who did n't mince words when it came to right-wing extremism in general . " this party and the entire right-wing extremist movement have to be confronted resolutely , " she said .
" ' nip it in the bud ' is my personal conviction . " hamburg 's state interior minister udo nagel , who does n't represent a political party , told the ap news agency that " all the ministers want the npd to be banned " but that a ban simply was n't " legally or factually possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.04.2008 youthful german skeptics challenge religious convention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'd rather be dancing than praying a generation of young germans has turned its back on organized religion , finding the church outdated and irrelevant .
yet a new study shows that focusing on spirituality could win them back . a dozen teenagers hung out at the lengsdorf neighborhood 's youth center on a recent cold spring evening .
some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .
the center , in a middle class neighborhood in the western german city of bonn , sits just across the street from lengsdorf 's graceful st. petri church and uses a couple of basement rooms in a parish building .
but you wo n't find these teenagers in the pews come sunday morning .
like many german youth , they 're completely uninterested in organized religion .
both desiree , 17 , and laura , 15 , who did n't want to give their last names , identified themselves as protestants and said they willingly went through three years of confirmation classes , although desiree admitted she did it " only for the presents . "
while they both expressed an interest in spiritual themes , they do n't consider themselves religious .
desiree never goes to church and laura only attends at christmas .
" most of the people i know who are protestant do n't believe in god , " desiree said .
" i do n't believe in god because i think it makes for lazy thinking .
i think religion is something people made up . "
what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .
" i believe that people are reincarnated .
i 've seen reports where people talked about their experiences in past lives and it seemed very believable , " desiree said .
" but you 're heart does n't keep beating after you die .
i ca n't imagine it , " laura countered .
hierarchy and rules : very uncool while many young germans reject church , steffen hauff does n't believe that they have rejected god .
most of his 20-something peers might skip sunday morning services or frown on traditional christian views on sexuality .
but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there place in church choir for punk rockers ?
hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .
teens question tradition hauff said he does n't think the goal should be filling the church pews with young people .
" it 's not important that people are only in church for two hours on sunday mornings .
the important thing is everyday parish life ; that they spend time together and help each other , " hauff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many teens disagree with church doctrine on sexuality yet while it is often easy to convince teens to attend fun events like world youth day , it should also include a deeper relationship with god , religion and the church , said sigrid grabmeier .
teens usually are n't interested in more serious commitment , said grabmeier , of germany 's we are church , a group advocating reform of the roman catholic church .
most teens are turned off from church because there are " so many rules they do n't understand and do n't agree with , " grabmeier said .
few are willing to become actively involved in trying to bring about change .
yet grabmeier sees the youthful desire to question orthodox beliefs as healthy .
even her teenage sons , while religious , opted to take ethics at school because they felt it was important to expand their own understanding of the world .
" i find it interesting , " grabmeier said .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .

we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently .

it 's something i never really understood .

some lounged on a wraparound sofa while others hammered away at a foosball table .

what makes german teens tick ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens pose a challenge to churches while about half of german young people say they 're religious , the vast majority do n't act on their faith .
about two out of every three germans identify themselves as catholic or protestant , yet many by birth only .
one study showed that a mere 4 to 6 percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally .
a newly released survey by the heidelberg-based sinus-sociovision showed that while young people search for meaning to their lives , they do n't equate the answers with religion .
sinus-sociovision identified different " milieus , " or groupings of young people with similar goals and values , such as traditionalists , post-materialists , hedonists or experimentalists .
some of these groups have little or no contact with organized religion .
yet across many different types of youth , there 's a general interest in spirituality , the survey found .
this is backed up by a bertelsmann foundation study published in december 2007 , which found that a relatively large 41 percent of germans aged 18 to 29 expressed belief in god , and life after death .
reincarnation trumps resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist beliefs are often attractive to youth desiree might reject god , but she believes in life after death .

but they believe in something spiritual , even if it 's not fashionable to call it god , hauff said .
in hauff 's experience , " young people are very open towards spirituality . "
yet they do n't want the hierarchy and rules that they see as going along with organized religion , said hauff , who was involved in catholic youth organizations and scouting while growing up .

hauff currently heads aktion west-ost , a group which organizes youth exchanges between germans and eastern europeans .
he 's seen plenty of teenagers get excited about a spontaneous prayer session or sing along .
yet these more relaxed forms of religious expression remain very distant from the sunday morning experiences found in most catholic or protestant churches in germany .
hauff agrees with the sinus-sociovision conclusions that in order to reach teens , catholic youth organizations need to target their message to the different youth subcultures which often have very little contact with church .
furthermore , they need to take the dive into the internet-based social networking world in which many teens are immersed .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy agriculture -pipe- 13.04.2008 biofuels linked to soaring food prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high food prices have led to riots in the developing world debate continues to rage over food shortages , rising costs and the link to biofuel production .
german cabinet ministers are not in complete agreement over how much biofuels are to blame for food problems . dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund , warned of dire consequences for people in developing countries should food prices remain high . " thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington . skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti . some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits . call for reconsideration of biofuel goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants biofuels to cover 10 percent of its transportation needs by 2020 it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said saturday in a statement prior to the imf meeting . " the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " eu leaders agreed last year to obtain a tenth of all transport fuel from biofuels by the year 2020 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting climate change . biofuels are made from crops like corn , wheat , sugar and palm oil , which are refined into ethanol or oil .
they are used as an environmental friendly alternative to gasoline and diesel as they release lower quantities of co2 when burned .
both europe and the us subsidize biofuel production . food or fodder ? but also on saturday , germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel downplayed the effect biofuels have had on global food prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said fodder prices have also been rising " we can meet the 10 percent target through biofuel production in the european union -lsb- and imports of -rsb- raw materials , which do not lead to a conflict with food or rainforests , " gabriel told reporters saturday on the sidelines of an eu environment meeting in slovenia . " the big competition is not between the use of biomass for energy and food but between feed and food , " said gabriel .

the team had slipped from second to third in the bundesliga . the decision ends months of speculation that he would be replaced after a disappointing first half of the season , despite an overall successful record with the team . the two final blows for slomka , 40 , were elimination from the champions league by barcelona and humiliation by league rivals werder bremen in a 5-1 loss on saturday .
slomka left the club with immediate effect after leading a training session sunday morning . general manager andreas mueller informed slomka that the directors of the gelsenkirchen club had voted unanimously in favor of the dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen celebrates a goal in the game that sealed slomka 's fate " i had tended recently towards ending the cooperation with mirko at the end of the season , " mueller said . " after the game against bremen i came to the conclusion it would be better to bring the decision forward . " slomka , who has reacted angrily recently to speculation about his dismissal , is not alone among coaches finding themselves out of work .
he is the fourth bundesliga trainer to be dismissed this season following petrik sander -lrb- energie cottbus -rrb- , ernst middendorp -lrb- arminia bielefeld -rrb- and hans meyer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- . " mirko did a good job and that 's clearly documented by his successful record , " said mueller .
" but during the course of this season we got the impression the team was n't developing further .
we came to the conclusion a new coach could do that better . " admirable record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc schalke 04 logo slomka was appointed schalke coach on january 4 , 2006 , moving up from the position of co-trainer after the club dismissed ralf rangnick . schalke reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup that season and last year with slomka came close to claiming a first german league title for 50 years , only to be beaten by two points by surprise side vfb stuttgart . his position was weakened when he was publicly criticized in february by president josef schnusenberg , who said the club needed a coach with an international reputation . despite this the team climbed to second placed behind bayern munich in the league , before saturday 's defeat at bremen moved them back to third , nine points behind bayern who were playing later sunday . frustration set in asked about his position immediately after saturday 's defeat , slomka told premiere television he was fed up with having to defend himself . " the discussion is pretty much limited to certain groups that have something against me , " he said .
" we were in second place before the werder bremen match and made it to the top eight in europe and yet there 's still a discussion about my future .
i do n't have any desire to face this discussion every week any more . " slomka leaves along with his assistant , nestor el maestro .
former players mike bueskens and youri mulder will be joint caretaker coaches for the remaining six matches of the season . both were members of the schalke team which won the 1997 uefa cup .
bueskens is currently amateur team coach , while dutchman mulder has been working as a television commentator for the dutch broadcaster nos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi schalke strike kevin kuranyi told the dpa news agency : " we are losing a very good coach , but schalke have had a difficult phase recently . " midfielder jermaine jones , who joined schalke at the beginning of the season , also told dpa : " since my first day of training in the summer , slomka has been criticized .

but things can change . wagner 's spokesman peter emmerich , however , confirmed that the director-for-life had this week submitted a letter expressing his intention to retire to the board of the bayreuth festival . emmerich also said that wagner could now imagine a co-directorship involving both daughters .
previously , he had categorically rejected appointing eva wagner-pasquier , 63 , his daughter with his first wife . sisters make up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier the half-sisters have been called on by both the festival board and thomas goppel , bavaria 's minister for science , research and the arts , to devise a joint proposal for the future of the festival as soon as possible . it 's well known that the two have not been on good terms , but emmerich said the two have become closer since katharina 's mother gudrun wagner passed away last fall , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner founded in 1876 by richard wagner , the festival has become an opera spectacle of legendary proportions and the performances are sold out years in advance . wolfgang wagner has directed the event since 1951 .

the union of welsh independent churches said it was " disappointed " and wants all the money raised donated to christian charities .
the eisteddfod has already agreed a portion will be donated .
it cited health and safety grounds for the decision and said the charge was to enter the field not the service itself .
its board has also agreed to hold further talks with objectors .
hugh thomas , chairman of the eisteddfod 's governing board said : " the board made the decision based on our responsibility under health and safety regulations .
" we 're not charging to go to a religious service , we 're charging to go on to the eisteddfod field .
" therefore that is why we are sticking by our policy of charging so that we have control of those who visit the national eisteddfod site , " mr thomas added .
dr geraint tudur , general secretary of the union of welsh independent churches said hundreds of church members and chapel-goers in the cardiff area would be attending because their usual places of worship had agreed not to open .
" it is not right that the eisteddfod should pocket thousands of pounds profit from worshippers who leave the maes -lrb- eisteddfod field -rrb- immediately after the service , " he said .
" the number of people present at the service should be counted , and a sum corresponding to their total entrance fee paid to a christian charity , such as christian aid . "
speaking before the council meeting in aberystwyth on saturday , cytun 's chief executive , rev aled edwards said he wanted to see the eisteddfod reconsider its position .
' misconduct ' " it is an ageless principle , indeed one that is at the core of the christian faith , that worship is free for all , " said rev edwards .
" whatever reasons the eisteddfod has for this change of policy , we do not believe that any one of them is sufficient to undermine the right to attend an act of worship free of charge , " he added .
elfed roberts , chief executive of the national eisteddfod said last month they had agreed a policy of charging everyone going to the eisteddfod every day , including the sunday .
the admission price for adults will be £ 9 .
management said there was a problem of people taking advantage of the free entry on sundays .
" in the past people have been going to the maes -lrb- the eisteddfod field -rrb- at times when we were n't charging and that has led to misconduct , " mr roberts said .
" on sunday mornings , there are hundreds coming to the maes to come in free of charge and most of these do n't go to the service . "

london-based law firm simons muirhead & burton said it was representing robert murat against sky , the sun and others .
the 34-year-old briton , who lives near the algarve holiday apartment from which madeleine went missing , denies any involvement in her disappearance .
reports suggest the action could lead to a record payout of more than £ 2m .
villa searched in a statement , the solicitors , who are specialists in media litigation , said they were taking action against sky , the sun , the daily express , the sunday express , the daily star and the daily mail .
they also listed the evening standard , the metro , the daily mirror , the sunday mirror , the news of the world and the scotsman .
libel actions sun daily express sunday express daily star daily mail evening standard metro daily mirror sunday mirror news of the world the scotsman sky media lawyer caroline kean of media law specialists wiggin told the observer newspaper that if mr murat successfully argued the papers implied he was involved in madeleine 's abduction or murder , he could win a record payout .
" you could expect £ 200,000 per paper , per claim , and that would clear £ 2m , " she told the paper .
joshua rozenberg , legal editor of the daily telegraph , which is not being sued , told the bbc the papers will try to prove that what they printed was true .
" the newspapers will now be making their own investigations to see if they can find more information about mr murat in order to justify the allegations they printed , " he said .
" so they may well be digging around in portugal to see what they can find out . "
mr murat was questioned by police 11 days after madeleine went missing from the praia da luz resort on 3 may last year , before being made a formal suspect - or arguido .
police searched the villa where he lived with his mother after sunday mirror journalist lori campbell spoke to the british embassy and the police about mr murat .
the british expatriate , who described himself as half-portuguese , had become known to journalists and told them he had been helping police with translation work during the search .
damages later , madeleine 's parents , kate and gerry mccann , were also named as official suspects in the case .
under portuguese law someone can remain an official suspect without charge for as long as the investigation is continuing .
last month , mr murat said he hoped the return of his computers signalled police were to drop his status as a formal suspect soon .
his mother , jenny murat , has always maintained she was with her son on the night of madeleine 's disappearance .
last month kate and gerry mccann won a libel settlement and apology from express newspapers for suggesting they were involved in their daughter 's disappearance .
the newspaper group paid the couple £ 550,000 in damages .

london-based law firm simons muirhead & burton said it was representing robert murat against sky , the sun and others .
the 34-year-old briton , who lives near the algarve holiday apartment from which madeleine went missing , denies any involvement in her disappearance .
reports suggest the action could lead to a record payout of more than £ 2m .
villa searched in a statement , the solicitors , who are specialists in media litigation , said they were taking action against sky , the sun , the daily express , the sunday express , the daily star and the daily mail .
they also listed the evening standard , the metro , the daily mirror , the sunday mirror , the news of the world and the scotsman .
libel actions sun daily express sunday express daily star daily mail evening standard metro daily mirror sunday mirror news of the world the scotsman sky media lawyer caroline kean of media law specialists wiggin told the observer newspaper that if mr murat successfully argued the papers implied he was involved in madeleine 's abduction or murder , he could win a record payout .
" you could expect £ 200,000 per paper , per claim , and that would clear £ 2m , " she told the paper .
joshua rozenberg , legal editor of the daily telegraph , which is not being sued , told the bbc the papers will try to prove that what they printed was true .
" the newspapers will now be making their own investigations to see if they can find more information about mr murat in order to justify the allegations they printed , " he said .
" so they may well be digging around in portugal to see what they can find out . "
mr murat was questioned by police 11 days after madeleine went missing from the praia da luz resort on 3 may last year , before being made a formal suspect - or arguido .
police searched the villa where he lived with his mother after sunday mirror journalist lori campbell spoke to the british embassy and the police about mr murat .
the british expatriate , who described himself as half-portuguese , had become known to journalists and told them he had been helping police with translation work during the search .

under portuguese law someone can remain an official suspect without charge for as long as the investigation is continuing .
last month , mr murat said he hoped the return of his computers signalled police were to drop his status as a formal suspect soon .

the prime minister , the leader of the opposition and other senior figures in public life regularly appear on the agenda-setting interview programme .
memorable moments - which still resonate - include gordon brown announcing he would not hold an early election within months of taking office , and the archbishop of york cutting up his dog collar in protest at the regime in zimbabwe .
and there have been many other unforgettable appearances from stars such as dame helen mirren , annie lennox , robert redford , woody allen , kate winslet and art garfunkel .
nearly two million viewers watch the show every week ; its success has been recognised with awards from the media professionals of the broadcasting press guild -lrb- best presenter -rrb- , and the plain english campaign - which chose ' the andrew marr show ' as the best national tv programme .
andrew also hosts bbc radio 4 's ' start the week ' every monday and wrote and presented his own ' history of modern britain ' for bbc2 , which was hugely popular with viewers and won prestigious awards from the royal television society and the broadcasting press guild , and has been nominated at this year 's baftas .
andrew is currently working on a second history series and various other documentary projects for bbc television .
andrew was born in glasgow , went to school in scotland and gained a first-class degree in english from cambridge university .
he began his career in journalism on the scotsman newspaper in 1981 , later moving to london to become its political correspondent .
he was part of the team which launched the independent in 1986 and returned as its editor , after a stint at the economist magazine .
he was then a columnist for the express and the observer before making the move into television , as the bbc 's political editor , in may 2000 .
with his insight and unique style , andrew quickly made his mark , winning awards from the rts and bafta for this reporting , principally on the ten o 'clock news .
he has written several books on politics and history but is modest about his achievements .
in his autobiography ' my trade : a history of british journalism ' -lrb- macmillan , 2004 -rrb- he explained how he " stumbled " into his career : " i could n't sing , act , tell jokes , play any musical instrument , hit kick or catch a ball , run for more than a few yards without panting , speak another language , or assemble things without them falling apart immediately .
" i was a scientifically illiterate innocent with the entrepreneurial instincts of a thirteenth-century peasant and the iron determination of a butterfly .
" journalism seemed the only option . "
andrew lists his hobbies as reading , cooking and painting .
he is married to the political journalist jackie ashley and they have three children .
