participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .
" people really like my declarations , " he told telenews . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .

but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "

take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .
" my neighbor was 93 , " one unnamed resident said .
" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "
expensive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to drive in sicily ?
take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .

media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .

media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "

but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .

" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .

post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .

the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .

" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .

but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "
he said that external experts had worked on individual cases as part of the company 's strict anti-corruption program . details remain sketchy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db says network deutschland 's work was entirely legal but the db spokesman refused to say why the company had chosen the berlin-based firm , nor did he give further information about the duration , scale or nature of the contract .
according to one of kuehn 's subcontractors , the work carried out for the telecommunications giant telekom and the state-owned railroad company was almost identical .
" it centered around tracking telephone data , bank data and the complete screening of the people in question , " the computer expert told handelsblatt .
he said that personal tax returns had also been acquired .
the targets were railway staff and people with links to the company , according to the source .
this is not the first time this year that company ethics have been called into question in germany .
germans were shocked earlier this year when discount supermarket chain lidl admitted that it had used surveillance cameras to monitor its staff - even to the point of checking how often they went to the bathroom and whether workers had personal relationships .

last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but in one of the continent 's most popular holiday destinations , italy , the number of banned beaches rose to 300 , up from 262 in 2006 and from just 125 in 2002 . however , officials in brussels noted that this increase showed that italy was serious about tackling its dirty bathing waters . german beaches getting dirtier at the same time , the percentage of dirty coastal bathing areas was stable in italy but on the rise in other countries , with beaches in germany , britain and portugal slipping the most . in germany , 93.7 percent of the beaches met the eu hygiene standards , down 4 percent from last year 's ranking .
britain 's rating dropped by 3 points , to 96.5 percent .
a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .

that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .

west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 03.06.2008 europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many europeans - as well as obama - are relieved it 's nearly over european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "
pyrrhic victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who needs politics , when you can go to the beach ?
but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "
but most german newspapers were content merely to reprint wire reports dealing with one of the longest american primary contests in memory . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europeans favor obama to mccain voters in five major european countries showed a strong preference for barack obama as their favourite candidate to win the united states presidential elections , according to a poll published on friday .

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "

but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .
" people really like my declarations , " he told telenews . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .

" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "

during the discussion , the radio director went on to talk about the role of “ hate media ” in african regions with conflict : “ hate develops from the unknown and ignorance .
the media has a key role in the fight against stereotypes .
journalists have to realize this responsibility .
they are always part of society and therefore in danger when they side with a party in a conflict situation .

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .

young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.06.2008 economy grows more than expected despite inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are up , but private consumption is down despite signs of slowing global economic growth and resurgent inflation , the european economy grew more than expected during the first quarter , according to data released tuesday , june 3 . the 15-member euro zone economy grew by 0.8 percent quarter-on-quarter during the first three months of the year , the european union 's statistics office said , with rising investment and inventories resulting in an annual 2.2-percent growth rate in the first quarter . this added to signs that the economy built around the euro has so far managed to withstand the fallout from the world financial market and credit crisis . despite the strong euro , euro zone exports rose 1.9 percent during the first quarter , with investments growing by 1.6 percent .
however , private consumption edged up only a marginal 0.2 percent , the statistics office said . the euro zone grew by 2.6 percent last year .
economists had expected the data would show the euro zone economy growing by 0.7 percent during the first quarter . growth could be short-lived however , economists expect the ripples from the financial crisis unleashed by the us mortgage market crisis and growing inflation fears to result in euro zone growth slipping back a gear as the year unfolds . indeed , the release of the latest growth figures was accompanied by further evidence of a pickup in inflation with industrial producer prices in the euro zone bounding ahead by an annual 6.1 percent in april . this came in the wake of a 2.0-percent monthly jump in energy costs , which resulted in a 14.3-percent leap year-on-year .
euro zone factory-gate prices grew by an annual 5.8 percent in march . the release of the latest data also came ahead of thursday 's european central bank meeting with analysts expecting ecb chief jean-claude trichet to talk tough at his regular press conference about the threat posed by renewed inflationary pressures . euro zone inflation hit a 16-year high of 3.6 percent in may , the eu statistics office said last week . ecb not likely to cut interest rates as a result , this is again likely to rule out any early moves by the hawkish ecb to follow the world 's other leading central banks and trim the cost of money to help spur economic growth . while tuesday 's data showed industrial producer prices creeping up month on month in april by 0.8 percent , the solid first-quarter growth rate will help the ecb to argue that euro zone growth remains on a sound footing . also driving euro zone growth during the first three months of the year was a perky 2.6-percent annual growth rate in germany , europe 's biggest economy . the broader based 27-member eu also recorded a 0.8-percent first quarter growth rate with a strong economic performance by the eu 's new member states in central and eastern europe helping to underpin the brussels-based bloc 's economic expansion . tuesday 's figures showed poland growing at 6.4 percent during the first quarter with both romania and slovakia reporting expansion rates of at least 8.0 percent in the first three months of the year . this resulted in an annual 2.5-percent eu growth rate during the first quarter . earlier this week the international monetary fund revised up its 2008 euro zone growth forecast to 1.75 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .
" my neighbor was 93 , " one unnamed resident said .
" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "
expensive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to drive in sicily ?
take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : press freedom around the world media used to incite genocide can also bring peace , forum told european journalists sound the alarm on press freedom media forum looks at journalists ' role in peacebuilding media in china - between censorship and commerce media -pipe- 03.06.2008 global media forum : new media in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new media are booming in asia in the latest report as part of dw 's global media forum , we look at how technological developments are changing society in asia - for the better , say some , while others disagree . asia , which has more than half of the world 's population , does n't have a single , homogeneous media landscape .
but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 03.06.2008 europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many europeans - as well as obama - are relieved it 's nearly over european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "
pyrrhic victory ?

but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "
he said that external experts had worked on individual cases as part of the company 's strict anti-corruption program . details remain sketchy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db says network deutschland 's work was entirely legal but the db spokesman refused to say why the company had chosen the berlin-based firm , nor did he give further information about the duration , scale or nature of the contract .
according to one of kuehn 's subcontractors , the work carried out for the telecommunications giant telekom and the state-owned railroad company was almost identical .
" it centered around tracking telephone data , bank data and the complete screening of the people in question , " the computer expert told handelsblatt .
he said that personal tax returns had also been acquired .
the targets were railway staff and people with links to the company , according to the source .
this is not the first time this year that company ethics have been called into question in germany .
germans were shocked earlier this year when discount supermarket chain lidl admitted that it had used surveillance cameras to monitor its staff - even to the point of checking how often they went to the bathroom and whether workers had personal relationships .
germany is particularly sensitive about such infringements on civil liberties due to its past . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the team soon disappeared behind specially erected barriers to start plotting their tournament campaign . only a handful of fans and media were on hand when coach joachim loew , captain michael ballack and the other players and officials checked into their five-star hotel on the lago maggiore .
locals and euro fans are not likely to see more of the team as training sessions are behind closed doors and the hotel complex is " guarded tighter than a fortress , " according to one local policeman .
after all , the germans did not arrive in switzerland on tuesday to please the fans but rather to put the finishing touches on the preparations for the june 7-29 euro tournament in austria and switzerland which is to bring a fourth continental title .
a first training session was held later tuesday as loew is wasting no time with just five days left before the team 's group b opener with poland .
croatia and austria are the other group teams .
" we have to work concentrated and focused every day , " said loew .
germany displaying typical focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew 's players will be well drilled before euro 2008 begins true to the motto of the team bus - " germany - one team - one aim , " loew has eight training sessions left to get his team in shape .
all players had two days off after a 2-1 win against serbia on saturday in gelsenkirchen which came after a first training phase of two weeks on the spanish holiday island of majorca .
" all players should be well rested after the two-day break , " said loew .
the main focus is the poland match with loew ready to rely on the team 's swiss scout urs siegenthaler .
" we will gather the latest information about siegenthaler on wednesday and thursday .
then we will pass the most important issues to the team , " said loew .
loew still to decide on attacking options bildunterschrift : while loew appears to know most members of his starting lineup he must still make up his mind whether to field lukas podolski as forward along with bayern munich team-mate miroslav klose or on the left wing where he has also done well in recent games .
but loew refused to discuss the issue : " we wo n't reveal anything .
we will try out a few options . "
german training takes place at a sports school in tenero behind a specially erected barrier to deter spies .
as a result , the german presence in this southern swiss is only visible through giant posters of loew and the players , german flags and a plastic cow painted in germany 's black , red and gold . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .
" people really like my declarations , " he told telenews . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .

that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .

but the team soon disappeared behind specially erected barriers to start plotting their tournament campaign . only a handful of fans and media were on hand when coach joachim loew , captain michael ballack and the other players and officials checked into their five-star hotel on the lago maggiore .
locals and euro fans are not likely to see more of the team as training sessions are behind closed doors and the hotel complex is " guarded tighter than a fortress , " according to one local policeman .
after all , the germans did not arrive in switzerland on tuesday to please the fans but rather to put the finishing touches on the preparations for the june 7-29 euro tournament in austria and switzerland which is to bring a fourth continental title .
a first training session was held later tuesday as loew is wasting no time with just five days left before the team 's group b opener with poland .

germany displaying typical focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew 's players will be well drilled before euro 2008 begins true to the motto of the team bus - " germany - one team - one aim , " loew has eight training sessions left to get his team in shape .
all players had two days off after a 2-1 win against serbia on saturday in gelsenkirchen which came after a first training phase of two weeks on the spanish holiday island of majorca .
" all players should be well rested after the two-day break , " said loew .
the main focus is the poland match with loew ready to rely on the team 's swiss scout urs siegenthaler .
" we will gather the latest information about siegenthaler on wednesday and thursday .
then we will pass the most important issues to the team , " said loew .
loew still to decide on attacking options bildunterschrift : while loew appears to know most members of his starting lineup he must still make up his mind whether to field lukas podolski as forward along with bayern munich team-mate miroslav klose or on the left wing where he has also done well in recent games .
but loew refused to discuss the issue : " we wo n't reveal anything .
we will try out a few options . "
german training takes place at a sports school in tenero behind a specially erected barrier to deter spies .
as a result , the german presence in this southern swiss is only visible through giant posters of loew and the players , german flags and a plastic cow painted in germany 's black , red and gold . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

director of the largest private broadcaster in kenya participates in a panel discussion during the deutsche welle global media forum. in bonn “ international media determine the agenda for development in africa , ” said rose kimotho , director of the private radio station kameme 101.1 fm , at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn .
she said that it was important that broadcasters not to try to simplify conflicts or exaggerate them .
“ the international media can ’ t let us down , ” said kimotho .
during the discussion , the radio director went on to talk about the role of “ hate media ” in african regions with conflict : “ hate develops from the unknown and ignorance .
the media has a key role in the fight against stereotypes .
journalists have to realize this responsibility .
they are always part of society and therefore in danger when they side with a party in a conflict situation .
minorities orient themselves on the media that represent their interests . ” “ many people feel cut off from the important processes and events in their society .
this is often the cause for conflicts and misunderstandings , ” said claudia anthony , un radio , sierra leone .
“ the media has to offer people access . ”
all of the panel participants agreed that there should be more of a commitment towards offering journalists in africa professional training .
the dw-akademie is already cooperating in this area with several partners in africa and offers courses in journalism , management and broadcasting technology .
“ journalists need forums where they can speak with each other , ” said anthony .
this is especially important for providing balanced reporting about an election .
apollinaire malumalu , chairperson of the independent electoral commission , democratic republic of the congo said that the government sees journalists as a “ threat to silencing war crimes and corruption . ”
he continued to state that government officials are therefore interested in appropriating journalists .
“ that ’ s why the media has to be independent from the government , ” malumalu said .
“ journalists are important to the fights against fear and intimidation , as well as the government ’ s control . ”

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "
pyrrhic victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who needs politics , when you can go to the beach ?
but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : press freedom around the world media used to incite genocide can also bring peace , forum told european journalists sound the alarm on press freedom media forum looks at journalists ' role in peacebuilding media in china - between censorship and commerce media -pipe- 03.06.2008 global media forum : new media in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new media are booming in asia in the latest report as part of dw 's global media forum , we look at how technological developments are changing society in asia - for the better , say some , while others disagree . asia , which has more than half of the world 's population , does n't have a single , homogeneous media landscape .
but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .

" but in one of the continent 's most popular holiday destinations , italy , the number of banned beaches rose to 300 , up from 262 in 2006 and from just 125 in 2002 . however , officials in brussels noted that this increase showed that italy was serious about tackling its dirty bathing waters . german beaches getting dirtier at the same time , the percentage of dirty coastal bathing areas was stable in italy but on the rise in other countries , with beaches in germany , britain and portugal slipping the most . in germany , 93.7 percent of the beaches met the eu hygiene standards , down 4 percent from last year 's ranking .
britain 's rating dropped by 3 points , to 96.5 percent .
a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 03.06.2008 europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many europeans - as well as obama - are relieved it 's nearly over european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "

a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .

some 3,500 german soldiers are already involved in the nato peacekeeping mission in the country 's north . norway will hand over command of the unit at the beginning of next month . the qrf will be responsible for helping local afghan authorities reconstruct the country and providing security .
in conflict situations , the soldiers are prepared to act as brokers and engage in combat if necessary .
though the troops will be based in the north , they may assist allies in other regions as well . germany has traditionally been hesitant to engage in combat missions and chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has firmly opposed sending troops to the more volatile south , where fighting has been intense . at an official send-off ceremony on tuesday , june 3 , jung will honor the 250,000th bundeswehr soldier to be sent on a foreign mission . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "
he said that external experts had worked on individual cases as part of the company 's strict anti-corruption program . details remain sketchy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db says network deutschland 's work was entirely legal but the db spokesman refused to say why the company had chosen the berlin-based firm , nor did he give further information about the duration , scale or nature of the contract .
according to one of kuehn 's subcontractors , the work carried out for the telecommunications giant telekom and the state-owned railroad company was almost identical .
" it centered around tracking telephone data , bank data and the complete screening of the people in question , " the computer expert told handelsblatt .
he said that personal tax returns had also been acquired .
the targets were railway staff and people with links to the company , according to the source .
this is not the first time this year that company ethics have been called into question in germany .
germans were shocked earlier this year when discount supermarket chain lidl admitted that it had used surveillance cameras to monitor its staff - even to the point of checking how often they went to the bathroom and whether workers had personal relationships .

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .
" my neighbor was 93 , " one unnamed resident said .
" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "
expensive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to drive in sicily ?
take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .

they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .

in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .

it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , private consumption edged up only a marginal 0.2 percent , the statistics office said . the euro zone grew by 2.6 percent last year .
economists had expected the data would show the euro zone economy growing by 0.7 percent during the first quarter . growth could be short-lived however , economists expect the ripples from the financial crisis unleashed by the us mortgage market crisis and growing inflation fears to result in euro zone growth slipping back a gear as the year unfolds . indeed , the release of the latest growth figures was accompanied by further evidence of a pickup in inflation with industrial producer prices in the euro zone bounding ahead by an annual 6.1 percent in april . this came in the wake of a 2.0-percent monthly jump in energy costs , which resulted in a 14.3-percent leap year-on-year .
euro zone factory-gate prices grew by an annual 5.8 percent in march . the release of the latest data also came ahead of thursday 's european central bank meeting with analysts expecting ecb chief jean-claude trichet to talk tough at his regular press conference about the threat posed by renewed inflationary pressures . euro zone inflation hit a 16-year high of 3.6 percent in may , the eu statistics office said last week . ecb not likely to cut interest rates as a result , this is again likely to rule out any early moves by the hawkish ecb to follow the world 's other leading central banks and trim the cost of money to help spur economic growth . while tuesday 's data showed industrial producer prices creeping up month on month in april by 0.8 percent , the solid first-quarter growth rate will help the ecb to argue that euro zone growth remains on a sound footing . also driving euro zone growth during the first three months of the year was a perky 2.6-percent annual growth rate in germany , europe 's biggest economy . the broader based 27-member eu also recorded a 0.8-percent first quarter growth rate with a strong economic performance by the eu 's new member states in central and eastern europe helping to underpin the brussels-based bloc 's economic expansion . tuesday 's figures showed poland growing at 6.4 percent during the first quarter with both romania and slovakia reporting expansion rates of at least 8.0 percent in the first three months of the year . this resulted in an annual 2.5-percent eu growth rate during the first quarter . earlier this week the international monetary fund revised up its 2008 euro zone growth forecast to 1.75 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 03.06.2008 europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many europeans - as well as obama - are relieved it 's nearly over european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .

some 3,500 german soldiers are already involved in the nato peacekeeping mission in the country 's north . norway will hand over command of the unit at the beginning of next month . the qrf will be responsible for helping local afghan authorities reconstruct the country and providing security .
in conflict situations , the soldiers are prepared to act as brokers and engage in combat if necessary .
though the troops will be based in the north , they may assist allies in other regions as well . germany has traditionally been hesitant to engage in combat missions and chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has firmly opposed sending troops to the more volatile south , where fighting has been intense . at an official send-off ceremony on tuesday , june 3 , jung will honor the 250,000th bundeswehr soldier to be sent on a foreign mission . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .
" people really like my declarations , " he told telenews . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .

" but in one of the continent 's most popular holiday destinations , italy , the number of banned beaches rose to 300 , up from 262 in 2006 and from just 125 in 2002 . however , officials in brussels noted that this increase showed that italy was serious about tackling its dirty bathing waters . german beaches getting dirtier at the same time , the percentage of dirty coastal bathing areas was stable in italy but on the rise in other countries , with beaches in germany , britain and portugal slipping the most . in germany , 93.7 percent of the beaches met the eu hygiene standards , down 4 percent from last year 's ranking .
britain 's rating dropped by 3 points , to 96.5 percent .
a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 03.06.2008 europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many europeans - as well as obama - are relieved it 's nearly over european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "
pyrrhic victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who needs politics , when you can go to the beach ?
but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the discussion , the radio director went on to talk about the role of “ hate media ” in african regions with conflict : “ hate develops from the unknown and ignorance .
the media has a key role in the fight against stereotypes .
journalists have to realize this responsibility .
they are always part of society and therefore in danger when they side with a party in a conflict situation .
minorities orient themselves on the media that represent their interests . ” “ many people feel cut off from the important processes and events in their society .
this is often the cause for conflicts and misunderstandings , ” said claudia anthony , un radio , sierra leone .
“ the media has to offer people access . ”
all of the panel participants agreed that there should be more of a commitment towards offering journalists in africa professional training .
the dw-akademie is already cooperating in this area with several partners in africa and offers courses in journalism , management and broadcasting technology .
“ journalists need forums where they can speak with each other , ” said anthony .
this is especially important for providing balanced reporting about an election .
apollinaire malumalu , chairperson of the independent electoral commission , democratic republic of the congo said that the government sees journalists as a “ threat to silencing war crimes and corruption . ”
he continued to state that government officials are therefore interested in appropriating journalists .
“ that ’ s why the media has to be independent from the government , ” malumalu said .
“ journalists are important to the fights against fear and intimidation , as well as the government ’ s control . ”

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .
" my neighbor was 93 , " one unnamed resident said .
" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "
expensive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to drive in sicily ?
take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but in one of the continent 's most popular holiday destinations , italy , the number of banned beaches rose to 300 , up from 262 in 2006 and from just 125 in 2002 . however , officials in brussels noted that this increase showed that italy was serious about tackling its dirty bathing waters . german beaches getting dirtier at the same time , the percentage of dirty coastal bathing areas was stable in italy but on the rise in other countries , with beaches in germany , britain and portugal slipping the most . in germany , 93.7 percent of the beaches met the eu hygiene standards , down 4 percent from last year 's ranking .
britain 's rating dropped by 3 points , to 96.5 percent .
a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .

" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "

take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : press freedom around the world media used to incite genocide can also bring peace , forum told european journalists sound the alarm on press freedom media forum looks at journalists ' role in peacebuilding media in china - between censorship and commerce media -pipe- 03.06.2008 global media forum : new media in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new media are booming in asia in the latest report as part of dw 's global media forum , we look at how technological developments are changing society in asia - for the better , say some , while others disagree . asia , which has more than half of the world 's population , does n't have a single , homogeneous media landscape .
but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 03.06.2008 berlusconi 's bridge to sicily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden gate bridge would look puny next to this italian prime minister silvio berlusconi plans to build a gigantic bridge over the strait of messina .
the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .
" my neighbor was 93 , " one unnamed resident said .
" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "
expensive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to drive in sicily ?
take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but in one of the continent 's most popular holiday destinations , italy , the number of banned beaches rose to 300 , up from 262 in 2006 and from just 125 in 2002 . however , officials in brussels noted that this increase showed that italy was serious about tackling its dirty bathing waters . german beaches getting dirtier at the same time , the percentage of dirty coastal bathing areas was stable in italy but on the rise in other countries , with beaches in germany , britain and portugal slipping the most . in germany , 93.7 percent of the beaches met the eu hygiene standards , down 4 percent from last year 's ranking .
britain 's rating dropped by 3 points , to 96.5 percent .
a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 03.06.2008 berlusconi 's bridge to sicily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden gate bridge would look puny next to this italian prime minister silvio berlusconi plans to build a gigantic bridge over the strait of messina .
the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .
" my neighbor was 93 , " one unnamed resident said .
" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "
expensive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to drive in sicily ?
take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?

" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .

director of the largest private broadcaster in kenya participates in a panel discussion during the deutsche welle global media forum. in bonn “ international media determine the agenda for development in africa , ” said rose kimotho , director of the private radio station kameme 101.1 fm , at the deutsche welle global media forum in bonn .
she said that it was important that broadcasters not to try to simplify conflicts or exaggerate them .
“ the international media can ’ t let us down , ” said kimotho .
during the discussion , the radio director went on to talk about the role of “ hate media ” in african regions with conflict : “ hate develops from the unknown and ignorance .
the media has a key role in the fight against stereotypes .
journalists have to realize this responsibility .
they are always part of society and therefore in danger when they side with a party in a conflict situation .
minorities orient themselves on the media that represent their interests . ” “ many people feel cut off from the important processes and events in their society .
this is often the cause for conflicts and misunderstandings , ” said claudia anthony , un radio , sierra leone .
“ the media has to offer people access . ”
all of the panel participants agreed that there should be more of a commitment towards offering journalists in africa professional training .
the dw-akademie is already cooperating in this area with several partners in africa and offers courses in journalism , management and broadcasting technology .
“ journalists need forums where they can speak with each other , ” said anthony .
this is especially important for providing balanced reporting about an election .
apollinaire malumalu , chairperson of the independent electoral commission , democratic republic of the congo said that the government sees journalists as a “ threat to silencing war crimes and corruption . ”
he continued to state that government officials are therefore interested in appropriating journalists .
“ that ’ s why the media has to be independent from the government , ” malumalu said .
“ journalists are important to the fights against fear and intimidation , as well as the government ’ s control . ”

however , private consumption edged up only a marginal 0.2 percent , the statistics office said . the euro zone grew by 2.6 percent last year .
economists had expected the data would show the euro zone economy growing by 0.7 percent during the first quarter . growth could be short-lived however , economists expect the ripples from the financial crisis unleashed by the us mortgage market crisis and growing inflation fears to result in euro zone growth slipping back a gear as the year unfolds . indeed , the release of the latest growth figures was accompanied by further evidence of a pickup in inflation with industrial producer prices in the euro zone bounding ahead by an annual 6.1 percent in april . this came in the wake of a 2.0-percent monthly jump in energy costs , which resulted in a 14.3-percent leap year-on-year .
euro zone factory-gate prices grew by an annual 5.8 percent in march . the release of the latest data also came ahead of thursday 's european central bank meeting with analysts expecting ecb chief jean-claude trichet to talk tough at his regular press conference about the threat posed by renewed inflationary pressures . euro zone inflation hit a 16-year high of 3.6 percent in may , the eu statistics office said last week . ecb not likely to cut interest rates as a result , this is again likely to rule out any early moves by the hawkish ecb to follow the world 's other leading central banks and trim the cost of money to help spur economic growth . while tuesday 's data showed industrial producer prices creeping up month on month in april by 0.8 percent , the solid first-quarter growth rate will help the ecb to argue that euro zone growth remains on a sound footing . also driving euro zone growth during the first three months of the year was a perky 2.6-percent annual growth rate in germany , europe 's biggest economy . the broader based 27-member eu also recorded a 0.8-percent first quarter growth rate with a strong economic performance by the eu 's new member states in central and eastern europe helping to underpin the brussels-based bloc 's economic expansion . tuesday 's figures showed poland growing at 6.4 percent during the first quarter with both romania and slovakia reporting expansion rates of at least 8.0 percent in the first three months of the year . this resulted in an annual 2.5-percent eu growth rate during the first quarter . earlier this week the international monetary fund revised up its 2008 euro zone growth forecast to 1.75 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .

" but in one of the continent 's most popular holiday destinations , italy , the number of banned beaches rose to 300 , up from 262 in 2006 and from just 125 in 2002 . however , officials in brussels noted that this increase showed that italy was serious about tackling its dirty bathing waters . german beaches getting dirtier at the same time , the percentage of dirty coastal bathing areas was stable in italy but on the rise in other countries , with beaches in germany , britain and portugal slipping the most . in germany , 93.7 percent of the beaches met the eu hygiene standards , down 4 percent from last year 's ranking .
britain 's rating dropped by 3 points , to 96.5 percent .
a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , private consumption edged up only a marginal 0.2 percent , the statistics office said . the euro zone grew by 2.6 percent last year .
economists had expected the data would show the euro zone economy growing by 0.7 percent during the first quarter . growth could be short-lived however , economists expect the ripples from the financial crisis unleashed by the us mortgage market crisis and growing inflation fears to result in euro zone growth slipping back a gear as the year unfolds . indeed , the release of the latest growth figures was accompanied by further evidence of a pickup in inflation with industrial producer prices in the euro zone bounding ahead by an annual 6.1 percent in april . this came in the wake of a 2.0-percent monthly jump in energy costs , which resulted in a 14.3-percent leap year-on-year .
euro zone factory-gate prices grew by an annual 5.8 percent in march . the release of the latest data also came ahead of thursday 's european central bank meeting with analysts expecting ecb chief jean-claude trichet to talk tough at his regular press conference about the threat posed by renewed inflationary pressures . euro zone inflation hit a 16-year high of 3.6 percent in may , the eu statistics office said last week . ecb not likely to cut interest rates as a result , this is again likely to rule out any early moves by the hawkish ecb to follow the world 's other leading central banks and trim the cost of money to help spur economic growth . while tuesday 's data showed industrial producer prices creeping up month on month in april by 0.8 percent , the solid first-quarter growth rate will help the ecb to argue that euro zone growth remains on a sound footing . also driving euro zone growth during the first three months of the year was a perky 2.6-percent annual growth rate in germany , europe 's biggest economy . the broader based 27-member eu also recorded a 0.8-percent first quarter growth rate with a strong economic performance by the eu 's new member states in central and eastern europe helping to underpin the brussels-based bloc 's economic expansion . tuesday 's figures showed poland growing at 6.4 percent during the first quarter with both romania and slovakia reporting expansion rates of at least 8.0 percent in the first three months of the year . this resulted in an annual 2.5-percent eu growth rate during the first quarter . earlier this week the international monetary fund revised up its 2008 euro zone growth forecast to 1.75 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .

the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "

however , private consumption edged up only a marginal 0.2 percent , the statistics office said . the euro zone grew by 2.6 percent last year .
economists had expected the data would show the euro zone economy growing by 0.7 percent during the first quarter . growth could be short-lived however , economists expect the ripples from the financial crisis unleashed by the us mortgage market crisis and growing inflation fears to result in euro zone growth slipping back a gear as the year unfolds . indeed , the release of the latest growth figures was accompanied by further evidence of a pickup in inflation with industrial producer prices in the euro zone bounding ahead by an annual 6.1 percent in april . this came in the wake of a 2.0-percent monthly jump in energy costs , which resulted in a 14.3-percent leap year-on-year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 03.06.2008 europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many europeans - as well as obama - are relieved it 's nearly over european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "
pyrrhic victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who needs politics , when you can go to the beach ?
but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 03.06.2008 europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many europeans - as well as obama - are relieved it 's nearly over european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "
pyrrhic victory ?

but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .

" but in one of the continent 's most popular holiday destinations , italy , the number of banned beaches rose to 300 , up from 262 in 2006 and from just 125 in 2002 . however , officials in brussels noted that this increase showed that italy was serious about tackling its dirty bathing waters . german beaches getting dirtier at the same time , the percentage of dirty coastal bathing areas was stable in italy but on the rise in other countries , with beaches in germany , britain and portugal slipping the most . in germany , 93.7 percent of the beaches met the eu hygiene standards , down 4 percent from last year 's ranking .
britain 's rating dropped by 3 points , to 96.5 percent .
a british diplomat in brussels attributed the slippage to the flood there , the worst in 60 years , which caused sewers to overflow into the ocean . overall , the cleanest bathing waters were found in greece , cyprus , finland and the netherlands .
the dutch made the top grade , with all of their 86 tested beaches meeting the hygiene standards for the third year running . that data refers to the eu 's annual report , meaning that more up-to-date information would have to be obtained from the local media , officials said . click on the link below to check the water quality of any eu beach , river or lake by consulting an interactive map . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "
he said that external experts had worked on individual cases as part of the company 's strict anti-corruption program . details remain sketchy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db says network deutschland 's work was entirely legal but the db spokesman refused to say why the company had chosen the berlin-based firm , nor did he give further information about the duration , scale or nature of the contract .
according to one of kuehn 's subcontractors , the work carried out for the telecommunications giant telekom and the state-owned railroad company was almost identical .
" it centered around tracking telephone data , bank data and the complete screening of the people in question , " the computer expert told handelsblatt .
he said that personal tax returns had also been acquired .
the targets were railway staff and people with links to the company , according to the source .
this is not the first time this year that company ethics have been called into question in germany .
germans were shocked earlier this year when discount supermarket chain lidl admitted that it had used surveillance cameras to monitor its staff - even to the point of checking how often they went to the bathroom and whether workers had personal relationships .

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .
" my neighbor was 93 , " one unnamed resident said .
" he had already heard about the bridge project as a 60-year-old .
but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "
expensive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : want to drive in sicily ?
take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .

but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "

take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .

but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .

they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .

in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .

it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , private consumption edged up only a marginal 0.2 percent , the statistics office said . the euro zone grew by 2.6 percent last year .
economists had expected the data would show the euro zone economy growing by 0.7 percent during the first quarter . growth could be short-lived however , economists expect the ripples from the financial crisis unleashed by the us mortgage market crisis and growing inflation fears to result in euro zone growth slipping back a gear as the year unfolds . indeed , the release of the latest growth figures was accompanied by further evidence of a pickup in inflation with industrial producer prices in the euro zone bounding ahead by an annual 6.1 percent in april . this came in the wake of a 2.0-percent monthly jump in energy costs , which resulted in a 14.3-percent leap year-on-year .
euro zone factory-gate prices grew by an annual 5.8 percent in march . the release of the latest data also came ahead of thursday 's european central bank meeting with analysts expecting ecb chief jean-claude trichet to talk tough at his regular press conference about the threat posed by renewed inflationary pressures . euro zone inflation hit a 16-year high of 3.6 percent in may , the eu statistics office said last week . ecb not likely to cut interest rates as a result , this is again likely to rule out any early moves by the hawkish ecb to follow the world 's other leading central banks and trim the cost of money to help spur economic growth . while tuesday 's data showed industrial producer prices creeping up month on month in april by 0.8 percent , the solid first-quarter growth rate will help the ecb to argue that euro zone growth remains on a sound footing . also driving euro zone growth during the first three months of the year was a perky 2.6-percent annual growth rate in germany , europe 's biggest economy . the broader based 27-member eu also recorded a 0.8-percent first quarter growth rate with a strong economic performance by the eu 's new member states in central and eastern europe helping to underpin the brussels-based bloc 's economic expansion . tuesday 's figures showed poland growing at 6.4 percent during the first quarter with both romania and slovakia reporting expansion rates of at least 8.0 percent in the first three months of the year . this resulted in an annual 2.5-percent eu growth rate during the first quarter . earlier this week the international monetary fund revised up its 2008 euro zone growth forecast to 1.75 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .
the bridge was scheduled to open in 2011 .
yet when berlusconi 's center-conservative coalition lost , his successor , romano prodi , shelved the scheme as being pointless and expensive .
but now berlusconi is back and so is the brigde project .
it is now scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
but the residents do n't believe a word .
they do n't believe it will be built in their lifetimes .

but in 93 years he has n't seen a single trace . "

take a ferry the project was projected to cost 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.8 billion -rrb- , but after the delay the estimate has been raised to 6 billion .
in the end the bridge could cost twice as much .
those opposed to the scheme feel that even that enormous sum is unjustifiable as the mafia is likely to profit handsomely from it .
the excavations required would in themselves be a massive undertaking , said antonio di natale .
the marine biologist is n't worried about the mafia , he 's concerned about the biological equilibrium of the strait of messina .
" millions of sea dwellers swim through this path , " said di natale.the new bridge could be fatal to the sea creatures living there .
for example , the bridge 's shadow could block their routes .
" we do not know exactly , but i believe that we should not incur such a risk , " the biologist said .
does italy need this bridge ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's concern that the mafia will profit from the project there are similar concerns that the bridge would pose a danger to the millions of birds that migrate past here twice a year .
but , most importantly , the construction is not needed , opponents say .
it would be the largest suspension bridge in the world and have six traffic lanes and two train tracks .
but it would connect two regions which are famous for having poor infrastructures .
in both calabria and sicily the highways and railroads which would connect to the bridge are extremely old .
for the bridge to pay off , the traffic volume would need to be around 2.5 million vehicles over the next hundred years . but a century from now , it may well be that the bridge has still not been built . karl hoffmann -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the team soon disappeared behind specially erected barriers to start plotting their tournament campaign . only a handful of fans and media were on hand when coach joachim loew , captain michael ballack and the other players and officials checked into their five-star hotel on the lago maggiore .
locals and euro fans are not likely to see more of the team as training sessions are behind closed doors and the hotel complex is " guarded tighter than a fortress , " according to one local policeman .
after all , the germans did not arrive in switzerland on tuesday to please the fans but rather to put the finishing touches on the preparations for the june 7-29 euro tournament in austria and switzerland which is to bring a fourth continental title .
a first training session was held later tuesday as loew is wasting no time with just five days left before the team 's group b opener with poland .
croatia and austria are the other group teams .
" we have to work concentrated and focused every day , " said loew .
germany displaying typical focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew 's players will be well drilled before euro 2008 begins true to the motto of the team bus - " germany - one team - one aim , " loew has eight training sessions left to get his team in shape .
all players had two days off after a 2-1 win against serbia on saturday in gelsenkirchen which came after a first training phase of two weeks on the spanish holiday island of majorca .
" all players should be well rested after the two-day break , " said loew .
the main focus is the poland match with loew ready to rely on the team 's swiss scout urs siegenthaler .
" we will gather the latest information about siegenthaler on wednesday and thursday .
then we will pass the most important issues to the team , " said loew .
loew still to decide on attacking options bildunterschrift : while loew appears to know most members of his starting lineup he must still make up his mind whether to field lukas podolski as forward along with bayern munich team-mate miroslav klose or on the left wing where he has also done well in recent games .
but loew refused to discuss the issue : " we wo n't reveal anything .
we will try out a few options . "
german training takes place at a sports school in tenero behind a specially erected barrier to deter spies .
as a result , the german presence in this southern swiss is only visible through giant posters of loew and the players , german flags and a plastic cow painted in germany 's black , red and gold . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "

but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .

new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .

media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .

india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "
he said that external experts had worked on individual cases as part of the company 's strict anti-corruption program . details remain sketchy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db says network deutschland 's work was entirely legal but the db spokesman refused to say why the company had chosen the berlin-based firm , nor did he give further information about the duration , scale or nature of the contract .
according to one of kuehn 's subcontractors , the work carried out for the telecommunications giant telekom and the state-owned railroad company was almost identical .
" it centered around tracking telephone data , bank data and the complete screening of the people in question , " the computer expert told handelsblatt .
he said that personal tax returns had also been acquired .
the targets were railway staff and people with links to the company , according to the source .
this is not the first time this year that company ethics have been called into question in germany .
germans were shocked earlier this year when discount supermarket chain lidl admitted that it had used surveillance cameras to monitor its staff - even to the point of checking how often they went to the bathroom and whether workers had personal relationships .
germany is particularly sensitive about such infringements on civil liberties due to its past . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : legislation is not the answer to the telekom scandal dw 's karl zawadzky believes the revelations of serious data abuses at deutsche telekom will dent the image of german business as a whole .
but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed .
-lrb- 02.06.2008 -rrb- german minister under fire over telekom spying scandal the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up .
-lrb- 02.06.2008 -rrb- deutsche telekom boss blames others for spying the embattled boss of deutsche telekom has distanced himself from the snooping scandal , which targeted news leaks from inside the firm to journalists , by blaming " a few bad apples " at germany 's national phone company .

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed . " gays are protected under greek anti-discrimination laws , but gay groups complain they still face widespread discrimination , both in public and at work . greece 's powerful orthodox church is staunchly opposed to granting gays legal rights and accepting common law marriages . the church 's new leader , archbishop ieronymos , enthroned earlier this year , has not raised any objections to the proposed reforms . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .

west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .

food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .

that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .

the project would finally bring direct road traffic to sicily .
but the project remains controversial . the argument for building the bridge comes down to tourism .
a bridge would allow tourists to drive over the strait instead of waiting in a long line for a ferry .
it would allow traffic to flow seamlessly , avoiding the backups created in summer when droves of tourists flock into italy and onwards to sicily .
the dream of connecting mainland italy and sicily are not exactly new .
the ancient romans already recognized the advantages of easing travel across the strait and had plans for a floating bridge made out of many small ships .
italian military and political leader giuseppe garibaldi wanted to build a bridge in the mid-19th century as a symbol of italian unity .
and in 1969 a competition resulted in the first concrete bridge project .
a political nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has thrown his support behind the project but the project did n't really get going until berlusconi won the elections in 2001 .

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "
he said that external experts had worked on individual cases as part of the company 's strict anti-corruption program . details remain sketchy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db says network deutschland 's work was entirely legal but the db spokesman refused to say why the company had chosen the berlin-based firm , nor did he give further information about the duration , scale or nature of the contract .
according to one of kuehn 's subcontractors , the work carried out for the telecommunications giant telekom and the state-owned railroad company was almost identical .
" it centered around tracking telephone data , bank data and the complete screening of the people in question , " the computer expert told handelsblatt .
he said that personal tax returns had also been acquired .
the targets were railway staff and people with links to the company , according to the source .
this is not the first time this year that company ethics have been called into question in germany .
germans were shocked earlier this year when discount supermarket chain lidl admitted that it had used surveillance cameras to monitor its staff - even to the point of checking how often they went to the bathroom and whether workers had personal relationships .

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "
pyrrhic victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who needs politics , when you can go to the beach ?
but opinions from europe about barack obama , who looked poised to seal the democratic nomination during the night of tuesday , june 3 , were n't all positive , either .
a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .
" he 's stumbling across the finish line , and there 's little left of the young hero of the party , who six months ago left the old guard in his wake . "

dw-world.de europeans favor obama to mccain voters in five major european countries showed a strong preference for barack obama as their favourite candidate to win the united states presidential elections , according to a poll published on friday .

those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser . maybe it was the summer weather , or the fact that the outcome was nearly certain , but europeans were hardly riveted by the final round of obama versus clinton in montana and south dakota .
the daily la stampa in turin , italy seemed to wistfully long for a stop to what it called the " primary carrousel . "
" from the perspective of logic and common sense , this has to be the end of the battle between barack obama and hillary clinton - the battle that has colored american politics since january and gotten harder and nastier every day , " wrote that paper 's editorialist .
the times in london took much the same tack .
" unless clinton has veered even further into an alternate reality than was already suspected , pushing on to the convention seems a wildly unlikely choice , with its potential to wreck both democratic prospects in november and her political career , " that paper opined .
the french paper la liberte de l 'est also called upon the former first lady to call it a day .
" for a while , hillary clinton 's determination could be admired , " wrote its commentator .
" but now it 's become obstinacy , and that 's counter-productive . "
post-mortems bildunterschrift : rumors swirled on tuesday , june 3 that clinton could quit polls suggest most europeans would prefer to see a president obama , and there was an unmistakable undercurrent of schadenfreude that former front-runner clinton was on her last legs .
" a lifetime 's worth of ambitions , 16 years of acquaintances in the democratic party establishment , 16 grinding months of rallies and debates , and $ 215m -lsb- 140 million euros -rsb- in campaign funds , all now are exhausted , " wrote england 's guardian .
the independent - one of the few european papers still bothering to file reports from the field - ran a rather dismal sounding portrait of clinton 's final days of primary campaigning .
" rather than pausing to ponder harsh truths , mrs clinton continued to pour her energies into battle as south dakota and montana become the last states to hold primary elections , " the independent 's correspondent wrote .
" voters who saw her yesterday were not mistaken when they heard her say more than once , ' when i am president , i will ... ' .
" the time for a reality check will be today , " the correspondent added , " as five months of stumping finally ends . "
the independent also took the opportunity in a separate article to draw aim at former president bill clinton , whose numerous gaffes and misjudgement on the campaign are widely seen to have damaged his wife 's chances .
" if political malpractice was a crime , he would surely have been indicted by now , " wrote a presumably tarantino-loving pundit in a piece entitled " kill bill . "

a number of papers , including the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich , questioned whether the would-be nominee would be able to defeat republican john mccain after taking months of battering by clinton .
" it was a long primary marathon , and it 's a bit as if , somewhere along the way , obama got winded , " that paper wrote .

" after the ceremony on tuesday , a prosecutor on the nearby island of rhodes ordered an investigation into whether grounds existed for charging aliferis with the offence of overstepping his authority . ambiguous legal wording a lesbian organization in greece said it had discovered a loophole in a 26-year-old civil marriage law that would allow gays to marry legally . the group , olke , said a 1982 law legalizing weddings and civil ceremonies refers only to participating " persons , " without specifying gender . the justice ministry recently introduced civil partnership legislation granting legal rights to unmarried couples , but gays are not included in the law . theofanou papzisi , a law professor at aristotle university in thessaloniki , said that the " civil marriage law does not specify gender , thus no one can be breaking the law if such marriage ceremonies are performed .

the squadra azzurra was welcomed by italy 's ambassador to austria , massimo spinetti , as well as friedrich stickler , the president of the austrian soccer association , the austrian press agency said . the team then headed to their base 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- away at schloss weikersdorf , a renaissance castle converted into a hotel in the spa town of baden . baden has gone to great efforts to welcome the world champions , with local businesses stocking up on italy-themed fan items , hoping for a boost in tourism . lucky pigs and high hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslav plasil and the czech team were greeted with lucky pigs the czech republic squad flew into innsbruck for their journey to seefeld , 30 kilometers away , where a reception included a guard of honor from local schoolchildren , a brass band and furry pigs - a symbol of good luck - for coach karel bruckner and the players . co-hosts switzerland in feusisberg and austria in stegersbach established their team bases , while poland arrived at graz airport for a trip to the thermal spa resort of bad waltersdorf , and the romanian squad set up their camp at the swiss mountain resort of st. gallen . speaking at the austrian base , coach josef hickersberger said the quarter-finals were the minimum for his team .
the co-hosts , seen as the weakest team in group b , are up against germany , croatia and poland . " we definitely want to reach the quarter-finals , " he said , adding that austria needed four points from the games against croatia and poland to do so . portugal and turkey , who are group a opponents , were the first teams to check into their team bases in switzerland , on sunday , and both held open training sessions monday evening . spain will be the last of the 16 finalists to arrive when they check into their tyrol headquarters on thursday .
by uefa rules , teams must arrive at their team bases five days ahead of the first games . vienna sets up fan zone meanwhile preparations for the tournament continued in vienna where city authorities closed off a long stretch of the inner city boulevard ringstrasse to serve as the main euro 2008 fan zone . traffic delays remained minimal as motorists were generally well informed about the changes in force until the end of the month . bewildered and annoyed pedestrians and cyclists however were subjected to 30-minute-treks and a myriad of detours as they tried to make their way around the city center . local businesses complained about the eerily quiet streets in the fan zone area and were hoping for customer frequency to pick up with fans arriving for the tournament 's kick-off on june 7 . vienna , one of austria 's four host cities during the tournament and location of the final on june 29 , set up the largest fan zone , which is expected to hold up to 50,000 soccer fans . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .
i think that germany will definitely be one of the top six . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?
well yes , austria will be playing at home , but there are also a lot of croatians living in austria and croatia is not so far away from austria , so i 'm sure that there will also be a lot of croatians in the stadium .
is germany one of the favorites to win the championship ?
germany is always one of the favorites - they proved that again at the world cup , although they did have a home advantage there .

his country is one of the insider favorites . twenty-seven-year-old mladen petric came to the bundesliga in january 2007 .
previously , he played for basle , becoming leading goalscorer in the swiss super league with 19 goals in during 2006/7 season .
last season , he was one of borussia dortmund 's mainstays , scoring 13 goals .
dw-world.de : mladen petric , you are one of the most important players in the croatian squad .
many experts rate your national team as having a good chance of winning the championship .
are croatia 's chances really that good ?
mladen petric : i think that we do have a good chance because we are a good team .
of course , it wo n't be easy .
everyone says that we are not in a difficult group , but i think it is an extremely tough one .
germany is another favorite to take the title .
poland was at the top of the qualification group in front of portugal and austria has the home advantage .
so it is going to be tough .
how much pressure does it put you under by being treated as the insiders ' favorite ?
we are not under any pressure .
the croatian soccer association has already said that it is very happy that we have even qualified .
many did n't think we would make it this far .
that 's why we are not under any pressure even if a lot of people say that we are the insider favorites .
we have our goals and we know what we want to achieve .
that is the way it should be .
what are those goals ?
first of all , it 's our aim to get through the group stage .
then we will see how things develop .
there 's no point in saying that we want to get through to the last sixteen .
one you have reached that goal , what then ?
but you must be thinking about getting to the final ?
i ca n't really think that far ahead .
it always depends on the shape that we 're in on the day and our opponents .
you have to have a bit of luck , too .
a lot can happen .
i think it is important that we get through the group stage .
the croatian squad had a disappointing time at the euro 2004 in portugal and the world cup in germany .
things just did n't turn out as well as the fans expected .
is euro 2008 an opportunity to make amends ?
the way that i look at it is that the pas is past and there is no point thinking about it any longer .
we put on a great performance to qualify and that won the hearts of the spectators and our fans .
the european championship is not a way of making amends for something that went wrong in the past .
but it is very important .
and that in itself is enough .
we just want to be successful .
what are the strengths and weaknesses of the current croatia squad ?
that will be revealed during the european championship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some insiders have got their money on croatia to take the tournament people can get some idea if they watch the last qualifying game between croatia and england in london .
that was a humiliation that cost the english their place in the championship .
it was not a humiliation .
we had to win the game because it meant such a lot to a small country like ours to win against england in london .
we went there to write history .
that was sufficient motivation for us .
can we expect more surprises like that ?
will the spectators continue to see croatia playing attractive , sound soccer ?
i hope so because we played some great games in the qualifiers .
i also hope that we can repeat this success during the tournament .
croatia is now being represented by a new generation .
is euro 2008 a test of their maturity ?
there has definitely been a very positive development .
not many of us were confident that we would make such a strong showing in the qualifiers because coach slaven bilic started off with a young squad .
but he has found a good mix between young and experienced players .
i believe in the future even if the kovac brothers decide to retire after the championships .
after the tournament we will have a lot of good young players who will move up to take their place .
the input of the bundesliga on the croatian national squad is visible .
there are a lot of players who currently play in germany or have done in the past .
has germany played a central role in the development of the croatian side ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladen petric has also put on some fine acrobatics for borussia dortmund i do n't think that our development as bundesliga players has that much to do with croatian soccer because we have no influence on the croatian league .
it 's a bit of an advantage for us because a lot of our players play in germany and we know the german squad pretty well , including its strengths and its weaknesses .
germany are set to meet croatia on june 12 .
will the game be a pivotal one for croatia on the way to hoisting the trophy ?
it 's not possible to say that yet .
it depends what happens in the other games .
i do n't think that we need to be afraid of any of our opponents . but i think that our most important game will be the first one , the opening match against austria .
is it going to be a difficult game because austria is one of the host nations of euro 2008 ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .
" people really like my declarations , " he told telenews . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , private consumption edged up only a marginal 0.2 percent , the statistics office said . the euro zone grew by 2.6 percent last year .
economists had expected the data would show the euro zone economy growing by 0.7 percent during the first quarter . growth could be short-lived however , economists expect the ripples from the financial crisis unleashed by the us mortgage market crisis and growing inflation fears to result in euro zone growth slipping back a gear as the year unfolds . indeed , the release of the latest growth figures was accompanied by further evidence of a pickup in inflation with industrial producer prices in the euro zone bounding ahead by an annual 6.1 percent in april . this came in the wake of a 2.0-percent monthly jump in energy costs , which resulted in a 14.3-percent leap year-on-year .
euro zone factory-gate prices grew by an annual 5.8 percent in march . the release of the latest data also came ahead of thursday 's european central bank meeting with analysts expecting ecb chief jean-claude trichet to talk tough at his regular press conference about the threat posed by renewed inflationary pressures . euro zone inflation hit a 16-year high of 3.6 percent in may , the eu statistics office said last week . ecb not likely to cut interest rates as a result , this is again likely to rule out any early moves by the hawkish ecb to follow the world 's other leading central banks and trim the cost of money to help spur economic growth . while tuesday 's data showed industrial producer prices creeping up month on month in april by 0.8 percent , the solid first-quarter growth rate will help the ecb to argue that euro zone growth remains on a sound footing . also driving euro zone growth during the first three months of the year was a perky 2.6-percent annual growth rate in germany , europe 's biggest economy . the broader based 27-member eu also recorded a 0.8-percent first quarter growth rate with a strong economic performance by the eu 's new member states in central and eastern europe helping to underpin the brussels-based bloc 's economic expansion . tuesday 's figures showed poland growing at 6.4 percent during the first quarter with both romania and slovakia reporting expansion rates of at least 8.0 percent in the first three months of the year . this resulted in an annual 2.5-percent eu growth rate during the first quarter . earlier this week the international monetary fund revised up its 2008 euro zone growth forecast to 1.75 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

participants attacked the obese , protectionism , biofuels and two leaders many felt should n't attend . the summit , which kicked off in the italian capital on monday , june 2 , was called to address fears that rising food prices could leave up to one billion people in danger of malnutrition or starvation .
un secretary general ban ki-moon attacked trade barriers imposed by india and china to protect their own citizens against the higher costs of rice and other foodstuffs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said nothing was more " degrading " than hunger " some countries have taken action by limiting exports or by imposing draft controls , " he told world leaders .
" beggar thy neighbor food policies can not work - they distort world markets and force prices even higher .
i call on nations to resist such measures and to immediately release exports designated for humanitarian purposes . "
west to blame ?
but brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said that farmers from poor countries needed to be able to make a living and blamed the " intolerable protectionism " of rich western countries for the fact that many food costs have doubled in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but bad news for consumers is often good news for producers " subsidies create dependency , break down entire production systems and provoke hunger and poverty where there could be prosperity , " da silva said .
meanwhile , the head of the un 's food and agricultural organization jacques diouf said many people in the west simply ate too much .
" no one understands … how overconsumption by obese people in the world costs $ 20 billion -lsb- 13 billion euros -rsb- each year , " diouf told the summit .
the fao is calling for $ 1.7 billion -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- in emergency aid to tackle the crisis .
food or fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors at the summit blames biofuels for driving up prices the summit also addressed the possibility that growing demands for biofuels , driven by skyrocketing oil prices , was driving the costs of rice , corn and wheat up .
many experts think that is the case - the us , for example , plans to channel around a quarter of its corn production into producing ethanol by 2022 .
but representatives from nations with an interest in biofuel production denied that it was driving the price rises .
" biofuels are not bandits , " brazilian president da silva said .
" to the contrary , if they are produced in a serious way they become an important tool to lift the poorest countries out of food insecurity .
unwelcome guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe has serious food security issues but the serious issues on the agenda in rome were somewhat overshadowed by squabbling about two of the attendees .
many countries , including germany , felt that zimbabwean president robert mugabe should not have been present .
" i find it very cynical that someone who has driven people … into hunger and -lsb- his -rsb- country into ruin dares to turn up at such a conference , " german development minister heidmarie wieczorek-zeul told the german television channel zdf .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad also caused controversy by linking the food-price crisis with israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many felt ahmadinejad should have stayed away " europeans have suffered the biggest damage from the zionists , and today the weight of this artificial regime , both political and economic , is on europe 's shoulders , " ahmadinejad reportedly told the telenews news agency .
that drew an official complaint from ronald s. lauder , the president of the world jewish congress , to the united nations and the italian government .
" it is deplorable that a leader like him , who is failing both his own people and the international community , is allowed to hijack the agenda of this important fao conference , " lauder said .
but ahmadinejad dismissed the idea that his statements harmed the summit .
" people really like my declarations , " he told telenews . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 3,500 german soldiers are already involved in the nato peacekeeping mission in the country 's north . norway will hand over command of the unit at the beginning of next month . the qrf will be responsible for helping local afghan authorities reconstruct the country and providing security .
in conflict situations , the soldiers are prepared to act as brokers and engage in combat if necessary .
though the troops will be based in the north , they may assist allies in other regions as well . germany has traditionally been hesitant to engage in combat missions and chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has firmly opposed sending troops to the more volatile south , where fighting has been intense . at an official send-off ceremony on tuesday , june 3 , jung will honor the 250,000th bundeswehr soldier to be sent on a foreign mission . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

railway company deutsche bahn reportedly employed the same firm that spied on journalists and executives for telekom . a spokesman for deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- confirmed that the firm had used the services of security consultants network deutschland , business daily handelsblatt reported .
the managing director of network deutschland , ralph kuehn , last week admitted analyzing illegally acquired telephone data on behalf of deutsche telekom .
the telecommunications giant has conceded spying on communications between executives and journalists in 2005 and possibly in 2006 .
company ceo rene obermann , who denies any knowledge of the activities , has called in prosecutors to investigate the case .
despite acknowledging the engagement of network deutschland by deutsche bahn , the db spokesman stressed that there had been " no illicit surveillance of staff or non-staff . "
he said that external experts had worked on individual cases as part of the company 's strict anti-corruption program . details remain sketchy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : db says network deutschland 's work was entirely legal but the db spokesman refused to say why the company had chosen the berlin-based firm , nor did he give further information about the duration , scale or nature of the contract .
according to one of kuehn 's subcontractors , the work carried out for the telecommunications giant telekom and the state-owned railroad company was almost identical .
" it centered around tracking telephone data , bank data and the complete screening of the people in question , " the computer expert told handelsblatt .
he said that personal tax returns had also been acquired .
the targets were railway staff and people with links to the company , according to the source .
this is not the first time this year that company ethics have been called into question in germany .
germans were shocked earlier this year when discount supermarket chain lidl admitted that it had used surveillance cameras to monitor its staff - even to the point of checking how often they went to the bathroom and whether workers had personal relationships .
germany is particularly sensitive about such infringements on civil liberties due to its past . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are trends that stretch across the economically booming continent .
the media are part of that boom .
media expert indrajit banerjee from singapore has some numbers .
" last month , china - with 220 million users , overtook the us as the world 's number-one internet nation , " banerjee told dw .
india has more than 9 million new cell phone customers every month , and the indian film industry , drawing on three billion visits to cinemas every year , produces the most films .
significantly , the indian film industry has established itself abroad .
14 of the top 20 grossing foreign films in britain last year were indian . "
new media are developing at a particularly fast rate .
but that means that mechanisms of monitoring and control no longer function as well as they used to .
media analyst drew mcdaniel , who specializes in south east asia , discussed how the state-controlled media in indonesia and malaysia were charged with overcoming ethnic conflicts - such as those in malaysia in the 1960s - and encouraging national reconciliation .
" the media were given the main role and responsibility for bring the country and society back together , " mcdaniel said .
but in the age of satellite transmissions and the internet , it 's no longer so easy to regulate the media , and private media sources are flourishing .
could freer forms of media escalate social and ethnic countries in rapidly changing societies ?
that 's mcdaniel 's provocative question .
india 's sucharita eashwar says freedom of the press should take precedence , arguing that conflicts only happen once and must be worked through .
" i do n't think discussions and reports about topics like this necessarily create conflict , " eashwar said .
" i think it 's the responsibility of the media to create a platform for discussion , where various interest groups can present their points of view .
the authorities can only register a problem and react appropriately , if it 's made public . "
one central issue is whether new media succeed in giving a voice to the entire population .
studies from afghanistan show , for example , that resistance to the government is strongest in those areas where the media are the weakest .
modern technology has made it possible for the media in most parts of asia to integrate their audience .
" 56 percent of our population of 91 million have cell phones , " said chiche lazaro .
" during the last election we were able to use citizens as journalists .
young people took pictures of election fraud with their cell phones and sent those images to television stations . "
today , even in communist china and vietnam , the asian media help to uncover corruption and misuse of power .
but sceptics saw other trends - for example commercialization - outweigh that of citizen journalism .
it will remain exciting to follow how the media in asia continue to develop . helle jeppesen -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those fighting is the family of charles o 'farrell , from merseyside .
the effects of asbestos exposure took three decades to emerge in charles o 'farrell , but then swiftly claimed his life .
he died , aged 81 , in october 2003 , just two months after the diagnosis of mesothelioma was made .
charles spent just three years at the linacre gas works in bootle working as a steel erector between 1964 and 1967 , and coming into contact with asbestos on a daily basis .
my dad has been dead five years in october and we still feel like the stuffing has been knocked out of us maureen edwards he later said that he was never warned of the dangers of breathing asbestos fibres .
mesothelioma is a particularly aggressive form of cancer and there is no cure .
when his family was awarded £ 152,000 in compensation against his former employer in the county court , humphreys and glasgow limited , they thought that this would mean someone would accept financial responsibility for his death .
out of business however , charles had outlived his former employer by some distance - humphreys and glasgow had ceased trading in 1986 and remains in liquidation .
so the family turned instead to the company which had provided public liability insurance to the firm back in the 1960s , excess insurance company .
they refused to cover the award , saying that the public liability was only triggered at the point his symptoms emerged , at which point they were no longer insuring the company .
his daughter maureen edwards , 52 , is now one of those leading the test-cases into the high court in an effort to force them to pay .
" he was exposed to asbestos while doing a hard day 's work , yet here we are all these years on , fighting for justice for him .
" it is no longer about the money .
it is about the insurers accepting responsibility for what he went through . "
our grief and sorrow is being dragged out and made worse by the insurers who we feel are doing all they can to get away without accepting any responsibility maureen edwards his old union , now called unite , is supporting the case on behalf of thousands of asbestos victims and their families in a similar position .
but for maureen , it is much more personal : " my dad has been dead five years in october and we still feel like the stuffing has been knocked out of us .
" mesothelioma is such a dreadful disease and it is agonising watching a family member suffer in the way my dad did .
" but now our grief and sorrow is being dragged out and made worse by the insurers who we feel are doing all they can to get away without accepting any responsibility . "

one of those fighting is the family of charles o 'farrell , from merseyside .
the effects of asbestos exposure took three decades to emerge in charles o 'farrell , but then swiftly claimed his life .
he died , aged 81 , in october 2003 , just two months after the diagnosis of mesothelioma was made .
charles spent just three years at the linacre gas works in bootle working as a steel erector between 1964 and 1967 , and coming into contact with asbestos on a daily basis .
my dad has been dead five years in october and we still feel like the stuffing has been knocked out of us maureen edwards he later said that he was never warned of the dangers of breathing asbestos fibres .
mesothelioma is a particularly aggressive form of cancer and there is no cure .
when his family was awarded £ 152,000 in compensation against his former employer in the county court , humphreys and glasgow limited , they thought that this would mean someone would accept financial responsibility for his death .
out of business however , charles had outlived his former employer by some distance - humphreys and glasgow had ceased trading in 1986 and remains in liquidation .
so the family turned instead to the company which had provided public liability insurance to the firm back in the 1960s , excess insurance company .
they refused to cover the award , saying that the public liability was only triggered at the point his symptoms emerged , at which point they were no longer insuring the company .
his daughter maureen edwards , 52 , is now one of those leading the test-cases into the high court in an effort to force them to pay .
" he was exposed to asbestos while doing a hard day 's work , yet here we are all these years on , fighting for justice for him .
" it is no longer about the money .
it is about the insurers accepting responsibility for what he went through . "
our grief and sorrow is being dragged out and made worse by the insurers who we feel are doing all they can to get away without accepting any responsibility maureen edwards his old union , now called unite , is supporting the case on behalf of thousands of asbestos victims and their families in a similar position .
but for maureen , it is much more personal : " my dad has been dead five years in october and we still feel like the stuffing has been knocked out of us .
" mesothelioma is such a dreadful disease and it is agonising watching a family member suffer in the way my dad did .
" but now our grief and sorrow is being dragged out and made worse by the insurers who we feel are doing all they can to get away without accepting any responsibility . "
" it 's important to us that we win this test case , not just for our family , but for all the other families now and in the future who will be devastated by this awful disease . "

a group from the fishing port of newlyn in cornwall set off in the early hours .
fishermen there claim the cost of diesel has doubled , eating away at profits .
they say the situation is " beyond critical " .
fishing boats use red diesel , which has risen from around 30p a litre to 60p a litre in the last 12 months .
sam lambourne , who fishes out of newlyn , said fuel costs used to represent 20 % to 25 % of the gross value of the catch , but now represent 65 % to 70 % of the gross value .
the price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment tom mcclure , skipper fishermen said they were unable to raise the price of fish to cover the rising fuel costs because what they catch is sold at auction .
tom mcclure , skipper of the trawler harvest reaper , said : " the price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment .
it 's not just the initial running costs , fuel prices are so high they are eating into profits , which is eating into the maintenance of the boat .
" a boat is a tool for earning money , you 've got to maintain that tool . "
elizabeth stevenson , president of the national federation of fishermen 's organisations , said : " we are looking for some sort of aid which will allow businesses to get back on their feet , to put together a plan of how to change their fishing patterns , to make them profitable or even break even . "
the fishermen from newlyn joined others from around the uk and some from france , in the demonstration outside the department for environment , food and rural affairs in london .
the protest was timed to coincide with a meeting between fishing industry leaders and the fisheries minister jonathan shaw to discuss the issue .
last month a similar protest at fuel prices was held by lorry drivers .

a group from the fishing port of newlyn in cornwall set off in the early hours .
fishermen there claim the cost of diesel has doubled , eating away at profits .
they say the situation is " beyond critical " .
fishing boats use red diesel , which has risen from around 30p a litre to 60p a litre in the last 12 months .
sam lambourne , who fishes out of newlyn , said fuel costs used to represent 20 % to 25 % of the gross value of the catch , but now represent 65 % to 70 % of the gross value .
the price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment tom mcclure , skipper fishermen said they were unable to raise the price of fish to cover the rising fuel costs because what they catch is sold at auction .
tom mcclure , skipper of the trawler harvest reaper , said : " the price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment .
it 's not just the initial running costs , fuel prices are so high they are eating into profits , which is eating into the maintenance of the boat .
" a boat is a tool for earning money , you 've got to maintain that tool . "
elizabeth stevenson , president of the national federation of fishermen 's organisations , said : " we are looking for some sort of aid which will allow businesses to get back on their feet , to put together a plan of how to change their fishing patterns , to make them profitable or even break even . "
the fishermen from newlyn joined others from around the uk and some from france , in the demonstration outside the department for environment , food and rural affairs in london .
the protest was timed to coincide with a meeting between fishing industry leaders and the fisheries minister jonathan shaw to discuss the issue .
last month a similar protest at fuel prices was held by lorry drivers .

a group from the fishing port of newlyn in cornwall set off in the early hours .
fishermen there claim the cost of diesel has doubled , eating away at profits .
they say the situation is " beyond critical " .
fishing boats use red diesel , which has risen from around 30p a litre to 60p a litre in the last 12 months .
sam lambourne , who fishes out of newlyn , said fuel costs used to represent 20 % to 25 % of the gross value of the catch , but now represent 65 % to 70 % of the gross value . "
the price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment " tom mcclure , skipper fishermen said they were unable to raise the price of fish to cover the rising fuel costs because what they catch is sold at auction .
tom mcclure , skipper of the trawler harvest reaper , said : " the price of fuel is crucifying us at the moment .
it 's not just the initial running costs , fuel prices are so high they are eating into profits , which is eating into the maintenance of the boat .
" a boat is a tool for earning money , you 've got to maintain that tool . "
elizabeth stevenson , president of the national federation of fishermen 's organisations , said : " we are looking for some sort of aid which will allow businesses to get back on their feet , to put together a plan of how to change their fishing patterns , to make them profitable or even break even . "
the fishermen from newlyn joined others from around the uk and some from france , in the demonstration outside the department for environment , food and rural affairs in london .
the protest was timed to coincide with a meeting between fishing industry leaders and the fisheries minister jonathan shaw to discuss the issue .
last month a similar protest at fuel prices was held by lorry drivers .

intel is the biggest supporter of wimax , which offers high-speed , long-range wireless connections designed for the mobile net .
" in our view they ought to be harmonised , " said sean maloney , head of sales and marketing at intel .
lte is a technology based on existing mobile networks and has broad support from many mobile bodies .
fast start mr maloney 's comments are likely to be welcomed by the mobile industry , which fears the impact two rival standards could have on the market .
earlier this year , vodafone chief executive arun sarin said he believed the two standards could be brought together .
lte supporters nokia alcatel-lucent lg electronics francetelecom / orange t-mobile china mobile huawei ntt samsung telecom italia zte motorola lte is proving popular with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers because it is seen as an evolution to existing 3g networks .
by contrast , wimax has won favour in the computer industry because its roots lie with wi-fi .
both technologies have supporters who are in the two camps .
for instance vodafone is currently trialling wimax in greece and malta and its us subsidiary verizon is trying out lte .
the two systems are non-line of sight , and offer " optimal " broadband performance in a cell network between three and five kilometres in size .
lte is also expected to offer higher speeds than wimax , peaking at 100 mbps download and 50 mbps uploads .
mr maloney said the two technologies were " broadly similar ... about 80 % similar " .
" the main difference is that wimax is a couple of years ahead , " he said .
motorola has already said that 85 % of the work and technology for wimax equipment will be re-used in its designs for lte equipment .
mr maloney said that customers would be " confused " by two competing 4g technologies .
" we would much prefer to see over a period of time that it looked to a global consumer that simply high-speed bandwidth was available . "
he said intel was " actively looking " at harmonisation .
" lte is still a little way away ; as it starts to show up we will be looking to see how we can harmonise with it , " he added .
it was technically possible that the chipset intel is introducing later this year to cover wi-fi and wimax , could also be used for lte , he said .
" we do n't have any plans to do that yet , " added mr maloney .
" it would certainly be a nice long term goal . "
falling behind ben wood , head of research at ccs insight , said harmonisation was a laudable goal .
" we can not keep having this situation where different parts of the world have different technologies , " he said .
" wide area broadband networks are critical , " said mr wood .
" we know there 's an insatiable appetite for those speeds . "
while data speeds on mobile networks were accelerating there was a danger they could fall behind again , said mr wood .
" the gap will open up again with fixed line networks , " he said , " though some of that can be made up with hsdpa and hsupa . "
lte is not expected to reach mass adoption until 2012 while the first wimax networks have already been rolled out in the us and japan .
paul otellini , chief executive of intel , said 10 million people would be using wimax by the end of 2008 , rising to " hundreds of millions two years after that " .

" the gap will open up again with fixed line networks , " he said , " though some of that can be made up with hsdpa and hsupa . "
lte is not expected to reach mass adoption until 2012 while the first wimax networks have already been rolled out in the us and japan .
paul otellini , chief executive of intel , said 10 million people would be using wimax by the end of 2008 , rising to " hundreds of millions two years after that " .

intel is the biggest supporter of wimax , which offers high-speed , long-range wireless connections designed for the mobile net .
" in our view they ought to be harmonised , " said sean maloney , head of sales and marketing at intel .
lte is a technology based on existing mobile networks and has broad support from many mobile bodies .
fast start mr maloney 's comments are likely to be welcomed by the mobile industry , which fears the impact two rival standards could have on the market .
earlier this year , vodafone chief executive arun sarin said he believed the two standards could be brought together .
lte supporters nokia alcatel-lucent lg electronics francetelecom / orange t-mobile china mobile huawei ntt samsung telecom italia zte motorola lte is proving popular with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers because it is seen as an evolution to existing 3g networks .
by contrast , wimax has won favour in the computer industry because its roots lie with wi-fi .
both technologies have supporters who are in the two camps .
for instance vodafone is currently trialling wimax in greece and malta and its us subsidiary verizon is trying out lte .
the two systems are non-line of sight , and offer " optimal " broadband performance in a cell network between three and five kilometres in size .
lte is also expected to offer higher speeds than wimax , peaking at 100 mbps download and 50 mbps uploads .
mr maloney said the two technologies were " broadly similar ... about 80 % similar " .
" the main difference is that wimax is a couple of years ahead , " he said .
motorola has already said that 85 % of the work and technology for wimax equipment will be re-used in its designs for lte equipment .
mr maloney said that customers would be " confused " by two competing 4g technologies .
nokia is backing both the wimax and lte technologies " we would much prefer to see over a period of time that it looked to a global consumer that simply high-speed bandwidth was available . "
he said intel was " actively looking " at harmonisation .
" lte is still a little way away ; as it starts to show up we will be looking to see how we can harmonise with it , " he added .
it was technically possible that the chipset intel is introducing later this year to cover wi-fi and wimax , could also be used for lte , he said .
" we do n't have any plans to do that yet , " added mr maloney .
" it would certainly be a nice long term goal . "
falling behind ben wood , head of research at ccs insight , said harmonisation was a laudable goal .
" we can not keep having this situation where different parts of the world have different technologies , " he said .
" wide area broadband networks are critical , " said mr wood .
" we know there 's an insatiable appetite for those speeds . "
while data speeds on mobile networks were accelerating there was a danger they could fall behind again , said mr wood .
" the gap will open up again with fixed line networks , " he said , " though some of that can be made up with hsdpa and hsupa . "

" the main difference is that wimax is a couple of years ahead , " he said .
motorola has already said that 85 % of the work and technology for wimax equipment will be re-used in its designs for lte equipment .
mr maloney said that customers would be " confused " by two competing 4g technologies .
nokia is backing both the wimax and lte technologies " we would much prefer to see over a period of time that it looked to a global consumer that simply high-speed bandwidth was available . "
he said intel was " actively looking " at harmonisation .
" lte is still a little way away ; as it starts to show up we will be looking to see how we can harmonise with it , " he added .
it was technically possible that the chipset intel is introducing later this year to cover wi-fi and wimax , could also be used for lte , he said .
" we do n't have any plans to do that yet , " added mr maloney .
" it would certainly be a nice long term goal . "
falling behind ben wood , head of research at ccs insight , said harmonisation was a laudable goal .
" we can not keep having this situation where different parts of the world have different technologies , " he said .
" wide area broadband networks are critical , " said mr wood .
" we know there 's an insatiable appetite for those speeds . "
while data speeds on mobile networks were accelerating there was a danger they could fall behind again , said mr wood .
" the gap will open up again with fixed line networks , " he said , " though some of that can be made up with hsdpa and hsupa . "
lte is not expected to reach mass adoption until 2012 while the first wimax networks have already been rolled out in the us and japan .
paul otellini , chief executive of intel , said 10 million people would be using wimax by the end of 2008 , rising to " hundreds of millions two years after that " .

i am old , nearly 88 .
i live alone .
while i am not seriously ill , i am not well .
i am trying to get up enough courage to walk outside - a place i have n't been for over a month .
i feel doctors consider me expendable .

they do n't know what is wrong with me , but they wo n't say so .
murray wren in my first job , i rushed to answer bells as soon as they rang - i was ridiculed by the other staff , and told : " sit down , she can wait . "
i found this appalling , and went anyway .
at the home where i was working this evening , a lady , nearly blind , and immobile in her room , asked if she could have a cup of coffee .
i surreptitiously whizzed to the kitchen and made her one - she was so grateful .
it took all of two to three minutes .
anonymous agency care worker as an art student i worked weekend shifts in a nursing home ; it was horrific how one is thrown into the deep end from the outset .
anyone can get a job as an auxiliary nurse in a care home , and usually it 's the unqualified , less competent members of society that do so as the work is unrewarding , underpaid and largely very unpleasant .
james dwelly why is it that others who have never worked and claimed benefits / unemployment benefit should have the same for free ?
my parents have been taxpayers all their life .
is it fair , then , that they and many others in the same situation should have to fund benefit claimants all over again ?
jenny goss for my husband and i , trying to find our way through the social services system as two reasonably articulate , compos mentis people nearly drove us to despair .
i dread to think what coping with the system must be like for the partner of an elderly person , or people less articulate , or vulnerable in some way .
bridget buckingham i really fear for the elderly in care today as a great number of these homes are purely money-driven and many owners are only concerned with the balance sheet .
care for the elderly is a concept that has become meaningless and , to be honest , i have found more sensitivity , nursing experience and care in the kennels where i leave my dogs when necessary than i have found in some of these homes .

elderly people and their families , carers , doctors and social workers contacted the programme in their hundreds to share their experiences .
i am old , nearly 88 .
i live alone .
while i am not seriously ill , i am not well .
i am trying to get up enough courage to walk outside - a place i have n't been for over a month .
i feel doctors consider me expendable .
when they send me for hospital tests they do n't bother to tell me the results .
i have to telephone them .
they do n't know what is wrong with me , but they wo n't say so .
murray wren in my first job , i rushed to answer bells as soon as they rang - i was ridiculed by the other staff , and told : " sit down , she can wait . "
i found this appalling , and went anyway .
at the home where i was working this evening , a lady , nearly blind , and immobile in her room , asked if she could have a cup of coffee .
i surreptitiously whizzed to the kitchen and made her one - she was so grateful .
it took all of two to three minutes .
anonymous agency care worker as an art student i worked weekend shifts in a nursing home ; it was horrific how one is thrown into the deep end from the outset .
anyone can get a job as an auxiliary nurse in a care home , and usually it 's the unqualified , less competent members of society that do so as the work is unrewarding , underpaid and largely very unpleasant .
james dwelly why is it that others who have never worked and claimed benefits / unemployment benefit should have the same for free ?
my parents have been taxpayers all their life .
is it fair , then , that they and many others in the same situation should have to fund benefit claimants all over again ?
jenny goss for my husband and i , trying to find our way through the social services system as two reasonably articulate , compos mentis people nearly drove us to despair .
i dread to think what coping with the system must be like for the partner of an elderly person , or people less articulate , or vulnerable in some way .
bridget buckingham i really fear for the elderly in care today as a great number of these homes are purely money-driven and many owners are only concerned with the balance sheet .
care for the elderly is a concept that has become meaningless and , to be honest , i have found more sensitivity , nursing experience and care in the kennels where i leave my dogs when necessary than i have found in some of these homes .
jaime valles i am amazed at how hospital staff can get away with treating people so badly .
if someone did not feed or water an animal they would be prosecuted , but it seems to be acceptable for hospital staff to do it to vulnerable elderly patients .
jane roberts she -lsb- my mother -rsb- is now in a jewish care home , where she has blossomed .
the home is - homely .
the staff are very caring .
although my mother has virtually no memory , she still plays scrabble , writes and draws .
there are different activities every day , and regular entertainment .
although the fact of dementia is tragic , my sister and i feel my mother is in the best place .
we see her regularly , she has 24-hour care , is safe and stimulated .
jacki reason my 94-year-old mother is in a home in her home town , and could n't be happier or better cared for despite failing health and the onset of senility .
they try to keep the fees down and their standard of caring up .
my american relatives were amazed at the family atmosphere in that financially struggling home .
nicki quy care homes are as bad as hospitals .
my father is blind - he was left with excrement on his hands ; left alone so that he regularly fell over .
people are frightened of whistleblowing in case they lose their place in an affordable local care home .

a cocktail of factors - low stocks and a weak dollar , soaring energy prices , a hunger for richer foods and the thirst for biofuels - has , according to the world food programme , pushed some 130 million additional people over the edge and into poverty .
jacques diouf , director-general of the un food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- , which is running the summit , told the bbc that the development of international agriculture has for too long suffered from being last on the list of political priorities .
instead , he argues , agriculture needs vastly more resources to reflect its role .
" if the world is serious about spending $ 1,204bn on armaments , then i think they should also ensure than 860 million people also get access to food , " he said .
map showing impact of food price rises on trade balances " we can not spend those kind of resources and not give priority for ensuring the most fundamental human right - the right to exist .
and to exist you need to have food ! "
loud voices mr diouf says the proposal to multiply by at least 10 times the organisation 's budget , to $ 30bn , will buy poor rural farmers the seeds , fertilisers , animal feed , infrastructure and irrigation they need to feed themselves , their communities and their countries .
summit agenda price controls , trade tariffs and export bans subsidies for biofuels help for farmers in poorer countries effect of climate change on agriculture cheap food era over challenges for the summit overseas development aid for agriculture in 1980 stood at 17 % of total world governmental budgets , but present levels , he says , have shrunk to 6 % , although the world 's population continues to grow and is expected to reach nine billion by 2050 .
yet perhaps for the first time , the hungry are not a silent , invisible , inconceivable mass .
the urban poor , who feel the impact of food prices directly as they are forced to buy what they eat , have led riots and protests on the streets from port-au-prince to cairo to buenos aires .
" a government has been toppled , we have had rioters in the streets , i believe now we will address this problem as seriously as we did in the 1970s , provided we put in the kind of resources needed , " mr diouf said .
global governance joachim van braun , of the washington-based agricultural think-tank the international food policy research institute -lrb- ifpri -rrb- , agrees that the level of anger felt by the urban dwellers , whose food bills now constitute over 50 % of their income , is one of the key factors of the current food crisis .
we 'd better get our house in order so the world does n't go into an ad-hoc crisis mode over one of its most basic problems - how to feed its people joachim van braun , international food policy research institute " i think a number of world leaders have really been shaken by the outbursts of extreme frustration and aggression , " he said .
" there have been protests in 30 countries - that is what has triggered the response , not the suffering . "
he agrees that agriculture has been pitifully underfunded yet is convinced that the lack of a single , efficient mechanism to deal with the challenges of a volatile international commodities system remains an unresolved problem .
" the global governance architecture for agriculture is not what the world needs - it simply is n't producing the goods .
if you look at the un response - the un secretary general took charge and wanted to co-ordinate across over 20 un agencies .
it gives an indication that no single mechanism exists that the boss himself decides to take it on . "
although analysts may argue about the balance of influences that triggered the crisis , and how it was worsened by panicked interventions from governments eager to keep a lid on domestic prices , two key factors he says - high energy prices and climate change - will not go away .
" we 'd better get our house in order so the world does n't go into an ad-hoc crisis mode over one of its most basic problems - how to feed its people , " he said .
the ifpri 's recipe for creating resilience to future shocks includes eliminating export bans , kick-starting food production programmes , regulating market speculation and completing the latest round of world trade negotiations to dismantle an international market distorted by subsidies and trade barriers .
marginalised farmers on a patch of grass across the road from the fao building , a small group of oxfam supporters , a few dressed as ears of corn , staged a small protest .
we know that at a lot of these conferences many statements are made , but nothing gets done without a proper framework madelon meijer oxfam oxfam 's agriculture policy advisor , madelon meijer , expressed hope tinged with cynicism about the summit 's outcomes .
" agriculture definitely needs more money , " she said .
" the question is how you invest that money - it needs to be spent on marginalised farmers , it needs to target women who provide the bulk of the food .
the fact that we have 40 heads of state and the un task force present is positive but it 's about keeping promises .
" we know that at a lot of these conferences many statements are made , but nothing gets done without a proper framework . "
mr von braun , who will be addressing the conference , agrees .
" the key will be not to repeat pledges and commitments .
we 've seen that before and we do n't need to see that again , it would be frustrating , " he said .
" what 's needed is a clear focus on implementation with definitions of accountability .

a cocktail of factors - low stocks and a weak dollar , soaring energy prices , a hunger for richer foods and the thirst for biofuels - has , according to the world food programme , pushed some 130 million additional people over the edge and into poverty .
jacques diouf , director-general of the un food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- , which is running the summit , told the bbc that the development of international agriculture has for too long suffered from being last on the list of political priorities .
instead , he argues , agriculture needs vastly more resources to reflect its role .
" if the world is serious about spending $ 1,204bn on armaments , then i think they should also ensure than 860 million people also get access to food , " he said .
map showing impact of food price rises on trade balances " we can not spend those kind of resources and not give priority for ensuring the most fundamental human right - the right to exist .
and to exist you need to have food ! "
loud voices mr diouf says the proposal to multiply by at least 10 times the organisation 's budget , to $ 30bn , will buy poor rural farmers the seeds , fertilisers , animal feed , infrastructure and irrigation they need to feed themselves , their communities and their countries .
summit agenda price controls , trade tariffs and export bans subsidies for biofuels help for farmers in poorer countries effect of climate change on agriculture cheap food era over challenges for the summit overseas development aid for agriculture in 1980 stood at 17 % of total world governmental budgets , but present levels , he says , have shrunk to 6 % , although the world 's population continues to grow and is expected to reach nine billion by 2050 .
yet perhaps for the first time , the hungry are not a silent , invisible , inconceivable mass .
the urban poor , who feel the impact of food prices directly as they are forced to buy what they eat , have led riots and protests on the streets from port-au-prince to cairo to buenos aires .
" a government has been toppled , we have had rioters in the streets , i believe now we will address this problem as seriously as we did in the 1970s , provided we put in the kind of resources needed , " mr diouf said .
global governance joachim van braun , of the washington-based agricultural think-tank the international food policy research institute -lrb- ifpri -rrb- , agrees that the level of anger felt by the urban dwellers , whose food bills now constitute over 50 % of their income , is one of the key factors of the current food crisis .
we 'd better get our house in order so the world does n't go into an ad-hoc crisis mode over one of its most basic problems - how to feed its people joachim van braun , international food policy research institute " i think a number of world leaders have really been shaken by the outbursts of extreme frustration and aggression , " he said .
" there have been protests in 30 countries - that is what has triggered the response , not the suffering . "
he agrees that agriculture has been pitifully underfunded yet is convinced that the lack of a single , efficient mechanism to deal with the challenges of a volatile international commodities system remains an unresolved problem .
" the global governance architecture for agriculture is not what the world needs - it simply is n't producing the goods .
if you look at the un response - the un secretary general took charge and wanted to co-ordinate across over 20 un agencies .
it gives an indication that no single mechanism exists that the boss himself decides to take it on . "
although analysts may argue about the balance of influences that triggered the crisis , and how it was worsened by panicked interventions from governments eager to keep a lid on domestic prices , two key factors he says - high energy prices and climate change - will not go away .
" we 'd better get our house in order so the world does n't go into an ad-hoc crisis mode over one of its most basic problems - how to feed its people , " he said .
the ifpri 's recipe for creating resilience to future shocks includes eliminating export bans , kick-starting food production programmes , regulating market speculation and completing the latest round of world trade negotiations to dismantle an international market distorted by subsidies and trade barriers .
marginalised farmers on a patch of grass across the road from the fao building , a small group of oxfam supporters , a few dressed as ears of corn , staged a small protest .

" agriculture definitely needs more money , " she said .

" there have been protests in 30 countries - that is what has triggered the response , not the suffering . "
he agrees that agriculture has been pitifully underfunded yet is convinced that the lack of a single , efficient mechanism to deal with the challenges of a volatile international commodities system remains an unresolved problem .
" the global governance architecture for agriculture is not what the world needs - it simply is n't producing the goods .
if you look at the un response - the un secretary general took charge and wanted to co-ordinate across over 20 un agencies .
it gives an indication that no single mechanism exists that the boss himself decides to take it on . "
although analysts may argue about the balance of influences that triggered the crisis , and how it was worsened by panicked interventions from governments eager to keep a lid on domestic prices , two key factors he says - high energy prices and climate change - will not go away .

a cocktail of factors - low stocks and a weak dollar , soaring energy prices , a hunger for richer foods and the thirst for biofuels - has , according to the world food programme , pushed some 130 million additional people over the edge and into poverty .
jacques diouf , director-general of the un food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- , which is running the summit , told the bbc that the development of international agriculture has for too long suffered from being last on the list of political priorities .
instead , he argues , agriculture needs vastly more resources to reflect its role .

the urban poor , who feel the impact of food prices directly as they are forced to buy what they eat , have led riots and protests on the streets from port-au-prince to cairo to buenos aires .
" a government has been toppled , we have had rioters in the streets , i believe now we will address this problem as seriously as we did in the 1970s , provided we put in the kind of resources needed , " mr diouf said .

marine environmental monitoring has received several calls from coastguards and walkers along the south coast reporting turtles being washed up .
mr penrose , the uk and the irish republic 's turtle strandings coordinator , says : " strandings have been reported from cornwall to wales and islands off scotland . "
loggerheads -lrb- caretta caretta -rrb- are categorised as endangered on the internationally recognised red list of threatened species .
they breed on the northwest atlantic , gulf of mexico and caribbean coasts .
unravelling the mystery determining why these rare turtles are arriving on uk shores can be very difficult unless a post-mortem is undertaken .
" we carry out a standard series of observations and tests , " says mr rob deaville , a cetacean expert at the zoological society of london -lrb- zsl -rrb- .
he adds : " an external examination will reveal if the animal has suffered any trauma or damage in the past .
" a depleted fat layer and the wasting away of muscle can suggest starvation as a result of cold-shock .
" bacteriology tests can help to determine if the turtle is suffering from disease . "
the cetacean strandings investigation programme -lrb- csip -rrb- , coordinated by zsl and funded by defra , has conducted 22 marine turtle post-mortems since 2001 .
struggle to survive mr deaville says : " causes of death have predominantly been a result of ' cold shock ' .
" hard-shell species of marine turtle , like loggerheads , are normally found in warmer waters south of the uk and are unable to raise their body temperature in order to survive in cold uk waters .
" the turtle can experience cold shock because of the colder water , become lethargic and unable to feed and eventually starve to death .
with some scientists forecasting a greater number of storms in the future , due to climate change , mr deaville warns : " extreme weather conditions could lead to an increase in turtle strandings on the coast of the uk . "
plastic bag and balloon ingestion have also been found as the cause of death in a small number of cases .
turtles swallow plastics after mistaking them for jellyfish , one of their staple foods .
as well as a series of tests , a number of measurements and photos are taken at post-mortem , which are archived .
mr deaville adds : " stranding events can help us increase our knowledge of marine animals which are usually so hard to study in the wild .
" any opportunity where you can study them further allows us to gain a much better picture of the animal 's biology .
" it can help us to understand the species as a whole and contributes to their conservation in the long term . "
lucky loggerheads of the 18 stranded loggerheads recorded this year , five were found alive , but only two have survived .
" james " , named after his scientific code number 2008/007 - being the seventh loggerhead found this year - and " dink " , are currently at home at newquay 's blue reef aquarium .
they were stranded one week apart in january .
uk turtle strandings 2008 loggerhead : 18 kemps ridley : 2 leatherback : 2 " when james first arrived he was at death 's door .
he was lethargic , dehydrated , covered in oil and very cold .
dink , being smaller , was more vulnerable but amazingly in better health than james , " says mr david waines , manager at newquay 's blue reef aquarium .
he continues : " we warmed them up steadily but slowly , increasing the water temperature of their tanks from 10c , the temperature of uk sea in january , to their preferred temperature of 25c .
" we scrubbed their shells daily and applied antiseptic gel to infected lesions .
james was put on a course of antibiotics and anti-fungals to cure infection .
" we were overjoyed when several weeks later they started eating for themselves and putting on weight - we knew they were on the road to recovery . "
homecoming dink and james have made such good progress they are being prepared to return to the wild .
they fly to the canary islands in late june .
mr waines says : " it can be quite a long journey , especially as marine turtles are not used to air-travel , but they will have reached peak condition and we are making sure the operation will run as smoothly as possible .
" once they reach the turtle rehabilitation centre in gran canaria they will be checked over and hopefully released within 24 hours .
" we will also microchip them , so if they are ever found by scientists again , their history will be known . "
he adds : " it will be sad to see them go ; they will be greatly missed , but it is great to know they are returning to the wild . "
dink 's and james ' success story started when their stranding was reported to marine environmental monitoring .
they ask people to be on the lookout : " if you come across a stranded animal , please report it to the strandings network as soon as possible .
marine turtles are a protected species in britain and shells must not be kept .
" a turtle may appear dead as its metabolism has slowed down due to the cold water and may not move at all , but it may still be alive . "

advertisement rob deaville performs a turtle post-mortem " there have been an unprecedented number of loggerhead turtle strandings this year ; 18 have been recorded so far on the uk coast , " rod penrose explains .
marine environmental monitoring has received several calls from coastguards and walkers along the south coast reporting turtles being washed up .
mr penrose , the uk and the irish republic 's turtle strandings coordinator , says : " strandings have been reported from cornwall to wales and islands off scotland . "
loggerheads -lrb- caretta caretta -rrb- are categorised as endangered on the internationally recognised red list of threatened species .
they breed on the northwest atlantic , gulf of mexico and caribbean coasts .
unravelling the mystery determining why these rare turtles are arriving on uk shores can be very difficult unless a post-mortem is undertaken .
" we carry out a standard series of observations and tests , " says mr rob deaville , a cetacean expert at the zoological society of london -lrb- zsl -rrb- .
he adds : " an external examination will reveal if the animal has suffered any trauma or damage in the past .
" a depleted fat layer and the wasting away of muscle can suggest starvation as a result of cold-shock .
" bacteriology tests can help to determine if the turtle is suffering from disease . "
the cetacean strandings investigation programme -lrb- csip -rrb- , coordinated by zsl and funded by defra , has conducted 22 marine turtle post-mortems since 2001 .
struggle to survive mr deaville says : " causes of death have predominantly been a result of ' cold shock ' .
" hard-shell species of marine turtle , like loggerheads , are normally found in warmer waters south of the uk and are unable to raise their body temperature in order to survive in cold uk waters .
" the turtle can experience cold shock because of the colder water , become lethargic and unable to feed and eventually starve to death .
with some scientists forecasting a greater number of storms in the future , due to climate change , mr deaville warns : " extreme weather conditions could lead to an increase in turtle strandings on the coast of the uk . "
hard-shelled marine turtles get cold in uk waters and struggle to survive plastic bag and balloon ingestion have also been found as the cause of death in a small number of cases .
turtles swallow plastics after mistaking them for jellyfish , one of their staple foods .
as well as a series of tests , a number of measurements and photos are taken at post-mortem , which are archived .
mr deaville adds : " stranding events can help us increase our knowledge of marine animals which are usually so hard to study in the wild .
" any opportunity where you can study them further allows us to gain a much better picture of the animal 's biology .
" it can help us to understand the species as a whole and contributes to their conservation in the long term . "
lucky loggerheads of the 18 stranded loggerheads recorded this year , five were found alive , but only two have survived .
" james " , named after his scientific code number 2008/007 - being the seventh loggerhead found this year - and " dink " , are currently at home at newquay 's blue reef aquarium .
they were stranded one week apart in january .
uk turtle strandings 2008 loggerhead : 18 kemps ridley : 2 leatherback : 2 " when james first arrived he was at death 's door .
he was lethargic , dehydrated , covered in oil and very cold .
dink , being smaller , was more vulnerable but amazingly in better health than james , " says mr david waines , manager at newquay 's blue reef aquarium .
he continues : " we warmed them up steadily but slowly , increasing the water temperature of their tanks from 10c , the temperature of uk sea in january , to their preferred temperature of 25c .
" we scrubbed their shells daily and applied antiseptic gel to infected lesions .
james was put on a course of antibiotics and anti-fungals to cure infection .
" we were overjoyed when several weeks later they started eating for themselves and putting on weight - we knew they were on the road to recovery . "
