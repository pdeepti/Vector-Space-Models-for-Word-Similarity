" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .
the extraordinary meeting was convened to discuss the latest conflict between georgia - an eu hopeful - and russia , which resents the west 's growing influence on its borders . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .
the american president will be haunted by his words , which have left georgia at the mercy of russia 's revisionist mood .
the war in the caucasus is another blow -lrb- to georgia 's democratic reforms -rrb- , which had been at the cornerstone of bush 's foreign policy in his second term in office .

the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 13.08.2008 high-tech suits , training help olympic swimmers break records großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it the suit that gives swimmers their record breaking speed ?
some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .

as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : war in the caucasus russia pulls out of gori as rice heads to peace talks new lines drawn as south caucasus region faces regional split merkel to push for lasting peace between russia , georgia european press review : cold war lines redrawn georgia -pipe- 13.08.2008 eu mulls sending peacekeepers to monitor georgia ceasefire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu nations say international peacekeepers in south ossetia would be more credible eu foreign ministers meeting wednesday debated sending international peacekeeping monitors to georgia 's breakaway region of south ossetia to uphold an eu-brokered truce between russia and georgia . at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on wednesday , aug 13 , france led calls to send in international peacekeepers to georgia 's breakaway province of south ossetia to replace russian troops there .
" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .
the extraordinary meeting was convened to discuss the latest conflict between georgia - an eu hopeful - and russia , which resents the west 's growing influence on its borders . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .

the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .

13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , with russian president dmitry medvedev in moscow before flying on to tbilisi to hold talks with saakashvili .
moscow had ordered a halt to military operations in georgia earlier in the day . both medvedev and saakashvili reportedly agreed to the eu peace plan , though it has not been finalized and several points of contention still need to be ironed out . on saakashvili 's request , medvedev agreed to remove a clause in the peace document referring talks on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia , separatist provinces in northern georgia with strong ties to russia . " the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt , " said the georgian president early wednesday at a joint news conference following his talks with sarkozy . eu ministers hold crisis talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev called tuesday for a halt to hostilities the six-point peace plan , which calls for an end to hostilities on both sides and a return to pre-conflict positions , is to be reviewed wednesday by eu foreign minister in brussels . both tbilisi and moscow continued to report attacks tuesday even after medvedev had ordered an end to military operations . though the eu called for an immediate cease-fire and appealed to russia to respect georgia 's territorial integrity , the bloc is deeply divided and has avoided taking sides in the caucasus crisis . while leading powers like france , italy and germany have had positive ties with russia , the formerly communist eastern european member states have condemned what they call russian aggression against georgia . during talks on wednesday , eu ministers would discuss a variety of measures including halting eu assistance , cancelling visa talks and reviewing negotiations on a new partnership agreement with moscow , lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas told reuters news agency . some eu countries have called for a european peacekeeping force in the disputed regions , but there has been no indication that russia would accept such a plan . georgia 's membership bid divides nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an attack on one nato member is considered to be an attack on all members meeting tuesday in brussels , nato ambassadors criticized russia for " excessive , disproportionate use of force " and reiterated support for georgia 's eventual membership in the alliance . georgian membership , however , has divided the alliance .
its bid to join was deferred at a summit in bucharest in april , with nato leaders promising that both georgia and ukraine , another former member of the soviet union , would become members at some point in the future . nato has agreed eventually to allow georgia entry into the western alliance .
moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , with russian president dmitry medvedev in moscow before flying on to tbilisi to hold talks with saakashvili .
moscow had ordered a halt to military operations in georgia earlier in the day . both medvedev and saakashvili reportedly agreed to the eu peace plan , though it has not been finalized and several points of contention still need to be ironed out . on saakashvili 's request , medvedev agreed to remove a clause in the peace document referring talks on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia , separatist provinces in northern georgia with strong ties to russia . " the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt , " said the georgian president early wednesday at a joint news conference following his talks with sarkozy . eu ministers hold crisis talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev called tuesday for a halt to hostilities the six-point peace plan , which calls for an end to hostilities on both sides and a return to pre-conflict positions , is to be reviewed wednesday by eu foreign minister in brussels . both tbilisi and moscow continued to report attacks tuesday even after medvedev had ordered an end to military operations . though the eu called for an immediate cease-fire and appealed to russia to respect georgia 's territorial integrity , the bloc is deeply divided and has avoided taking sides in the caucasus crisis . while leading powers like france , italy and germany have had positive ties with russia , the formerly communist eastern european member states have condemned what they call russian aggression against georgia . during talks on wednesday , eu ministers would discuss a variety of measures including halting eu assistance , cancelling visa talks and reviewing negotiations on a new partnership agreement with moscow , lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas told reuters news agency . some eu countries have called for a european peacekeeping force in the disputed regions , but there has been no indication that russia would accept such a plan . georgia 's membership bid divides nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an attack on one nato member is considered to be an attack on all members meeting tuesday in brussels , nato ambassadors criticized russia for " excessive , disproportionate use of force " and reiterated support for georgia 's eventual membership in the alliance . georgian membership , however , has divided the alliance .
its bid to join was deferred at a summit in bucharest in april , with nato leaders promising that both georgia and ukraine , another former member of the soviet union , would become members at some point in the future . nato has agreed eventually to allow georgia entry into the western alliance .
moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .
the american president will be haunted by his words , which have left georgia at the mercy of russia 's revisionist mood .
the war in the caucasus is another blow -lrb- to georgia 's democratic reforms -rrb- , which had been at the cornerstone of bush 's foreign policy in his second term in office .
the “ freedom agenda ” that bush envisioned after his re-election in 2004 is perhaps only a grand illusion . ” dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force . " some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .

" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .

under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force . " some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 13.08.2008 high-tech suits , training help olympic swimmers break records großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it the suit that gives swimmers their record breaking speed ?
some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force . " some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .
the american president will be haunted by his words , which have left georgia at the mercy of russia 's revisionist mood .
the war in the caucasus is another blow -lrb- to georgia 's democratic reforms -rrb- , which had been at the cornerstone of bush 's foreign policy in his second term in office .
the “ freedom agenda ” that bush envisioned after his re-election in 2004 is perhaps only a grand illusion . ” dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow had ordered a halt to military operations in georgia earlier in the day . both medvedev and saakashvili reportedly agreed to the eu peace plan , though it has not been finalized and several points of contention still need to be ironed out . on saakashvili 's request , medvedev agreed to remove a clause in the peace document referring talks on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia , separatist provinces in northern georgia with strong ties to russia . " the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt , " said the georgian president early wednesday at a joint news conference following his talks with sarkozy . eu ministers hold crisis talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev called tuesday for a halt to hostilities the six-point peace plan , which calls for an end to hostilities on both sides and a return to pre-conflict positions , is to be reviewed wednesday by eu foreign minister in brussels . both tbilisi and moscow continued to report attacks tuesday even after medvedev had ordered an end to military operations . though the eu called for an immediate cease-fire and appealed to russia to respect georgia 's territorial integrity , the bloc is deeply divided and has avoided taking sides in the caucasus crisis . while leading powers like france , italy and germany have had positive ties with russia , the formerly communist eastern european member states have condemned what they call russian aggression against georgia . during talks on wednesday , eu ministers would discuss a variety of measures including halting eu assistance , cancelling visa talks and reviewing negotiations on a new partnership agreement with moscow , lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas told reuters news agency . some eu countries have called for a european peacekeeping force in the disputed regions , but there has been no indication that russia would accept such a plan . georgia 's membership bid divides nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an attack on one nato member is considered to be an attack on all members meeting tuesday in brussels , nato ambassadors criticized russia for " excessive , disproportionate use of force " and reiterated support for georgia 's eventual membership in the alliance . georgian membership , however , has divided the alliance .
its bid to join was deferred at a summit in bucharest in april , with nato leaders promising that both georgia and ukraine , another former member of the soviet union , would become members at some point in the future . nato has agreed eventually to allow georgia entry into the western alliance .
moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

darwish died at a us hospital on friday , aug .

he was 67 .
darwish was cherished among the arab world for his poetry and literature , and in 1988 wrote the palestinian declaration of independence .
21 shots from the honor guard he had asked to be buried at the cultural center , having dedicated his life to poetry and literature .
his tombstone , unveiled on a hill outside the building , overlooks the vast terrain of the west bank and nearby jerusalem .
a palestinian honour guard fired 21 shots into the air after his coffin was lowered into the grave .
darwish 's body was earlier flown in a jordanian army helicopter from amman to the ramallah headquarters of palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
" today we say goodbye to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration , " said abbas , who described the poet as a " hero " who had been " committed " to the palestinian cause .
" i saw in you joy , hope and all the noble values .
you were the human being among us , " he told an audience of hundreds of palestinian dignitaries and foreign diplomats inside .

" some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

darwish died at a us hospital on friday , aug .

darwish was cherished among the arab world for his poetry and literature , and in 1988 wrote the palestinian declaration of independence .

his tombstone , unveiled on a hill outside the building , overlooks the vast terrain of the west bank and nearby jerusalem .
a palestinian honour guard fired 21 shots into the air after his coffin was lowered into the grave .
darwish 's body was earlier flown in a jordanian army helicopter from amman to the ramallah headquarters of palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
" today we say goodbye to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration , " said abbas , who described the poet as a " hero " who had been " committed " to the palestinian cause .
" i saw in you joy , hope and all the noble values .
you were the human being among us , " he told an audience of hundreds of palestinian dignitaries and foreign diplomats inside .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : war in the caucasus russia pulls out of gori as rice heads to peace talks new lines drawn as south caucasus region faces regional split eu mulls sending peacekeepers to monitor georgia ceasefire european press review : cold war lines redrawn georgia -pipe- 13.08.2008 merkel to push for lasting peace between russia , georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a long-term end to the fighting that has destroyed parts of georgia german chancellor merkel is to meet russian president medvedev friday and visit tbilisi next week for talks with president saakashvili on forging a long-lasting peace between georgia and russia after a bloody conflict . speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , aug .
13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 13.08.2008 high-tech suits , training help olympic swimmers break records großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it the suit that gives swimmers their record breaking speed ?
some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .

" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .
the extraordinary meeting was convened to discuss the latest conflict between georgia - an eu hopeful - and russia , which resents the west 's growing influence on its borders . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .
the extraordinary meeting was convened to discuss the latest conflict between georgia - an eu hopeful - and russia , which resents the west 's growing influence on its borders . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .
the american president will be haunted by his words , which have left georgia at the mercy of russia 's revisionist mood .
the war in the caucasus is another blow -lrb- to georgia 's democratic reforms -rrb- , which had been at the cornerstone of bush 's foreign policy in his second term in office .
the “ freedom agenda ” that bush envisioned after his re-election in 2004 is perhaps only a grand illusion . ” dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .
the extraordinary meeting was convened to discuss the latest conflict between georgia - an eu hopeful - and russia , which resents the west 's growing influence on its borders . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt , " said the georgian president early wednesday at a joint news conference following his talks with sarkozy . eu ministers hold crisis talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev called tuesday for a halt to hostilities the six-point peace plan , which calls for an end to hostilities on both sides and a return to pre-conflict positions , is to be reviewed wednesday by eu foreign minister in brussels . both tbilisi and moscow continued to report attacks tuesday even after medvedev had ordered an end to military operations . though the eu called for an immediate cease-fire and appealed to russia to respect georgia 's territorial integrity , the bloc is deeply divided and has avoided taking sides in the caucasus crisis . while leading powers like france , italy and germany have had positive ties with russia , the formerly communist eastern european member states have condemned what they call russian aggression against georgia . during talks on wednesday , eu ministers would discuss a variety of measures including halting eu assistance , cancelling visa talks and reviewing negotiations on a new partnership agreement with moscow , lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas told reuters news agency . some eu countries have called for a european peacekeeping force in the disputed regions , but there has been no indication that russia would accept such a plan . georgia 's membership bid divides nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an attack on one nato member is considered to be an attack on all members meeting tuesday in brussels , nato ambassadors criticized russia for " excessive , disproportionate use of force " and reiterated support for georgia 's eventual membership in the alliance . georgian membership , however , has divided the alliance .
its bid to join was deferred at a summit in bucharest in april , with nato leaders promising that both georgia and ukraine , another former member of the soviet union , would become members at some point in the future . nato has agreed eventually to allow georgia entry into the western alliance .
moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”

in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”

in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .

differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .

" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

darwish died at a us hospital on friday , aug .
8 , following open heart surgery .
he was 67 .
darwish was cherished among the arab world for his poetry and literature , and in 1988 wrote the palestinian declaration of independence .
21 shots from the honor guard he had asked to be buried at the cultural center , having dedicated his life to poetry and literature .
his tombstone , unveiled on a hill outside the building , overlooks the vast terrain of the west bank and nearby jerusalem .
a palestinian honour guard fired 21 shots into the air after his coffin was lowered into the grave .
darwish 's body was earlier flown in a jordanian army helicopter from amman to the ramallah headquarters of palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
" today we say goodbye to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration , " said abbas , who described the poet as a " hero " who had been " committed " to the palestinian cause .
" i saw in you joy , hope and all the noble values .
you were the human being among us , " he told an audience of hundreds of palestinian dignitaries and foreign diplomats inside .
" you will remain with us .
we tell you we will meet again and we will not say goodbye . " dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .

some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values .

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .

" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”

“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .
the american president will be haunted by his words , which have left georgia at the mercy of russia 's revisionist mood .
the war in the caucasus is another blow -lrb- to georgia 's democratic reforms -rrb- , which had been at the cornerstone of bush 's foreign policy in his second term in office .
the “ freedom agenda ” that bush envisioned after his re-election in 2004 is perhaps only a grand illusion . ” dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 13.08.2008 high-tech suits , training help olympic swimmers break records großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it the suit that gives swimmers their record breaking speed ?
some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 13.08.2008 high-tech suits , training help olympic swimmers break records großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it the suit that gives swimmers their record breaking speed ?
some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

darwish 's body was earlier flown in a jordanian army helicopter from amman to the ramallah headquarters of palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
" today we say goodbye to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration , " said abbas , who described the poet as a " hero " who had been " committed " to the palestinian cause .
" i saw in you joy , hope and all the noble values .
you were the human being among us , " he told an audience of hundreds of palestinian dignitaries and foreign diplomats inside .

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force .

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .

british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .
the american president will be haunted by his words , which have left georgia at the mercy of russia 's revisionist mood .
the war in the caucasus is another blow -lrb- to georgia 's democratic reforms -rrb- , which had been at the cornerstone of bush 's foreign policy in his second term in office .

darwish 's body was earlier flown in a jordanian army helicopter from amman to the ramallah headquarters of palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
" today we say goodbye to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration , " said abbas , who described the poet as a " hero " who had been " committed " to the palestinian cause .
" i saw in you joy , hope and all the noble values .
you were the human being among us , " he told an audience of hundreds of palestinian dignitaries and foreign diplomats inside .

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force . " some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force . " some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , with russian president dmitry medvedev in moscow before flying on to tbilisi to hold talks with saakashvili .
moscow had ordered a halt to military operations in georgia earlier in the day . both medvedev and saakashvili reportedly agreed to the eu peace plan , though it has not been finalized and several points of contention still need to be ironed out . on saakashvili 's request , medvedev agreed to remove a clause in the peace document referring talks on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia , separatist provinces in northern georgia with strong ties to russia . " the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt , " said the georgian president early wednesday at a joint news conference following his talks with sarkozy . eu ministers hold crisis talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev called tuesday for a halt to hostilities the six-point peace plan , which calls for an end to hostilities on both sides and a return to pre-conflict positions , is to be reviewed wednesday by eu foreign minister in brussels . both tbilisi and moscow continued to report attacks tuesday even after medvedev had ordered an end to military operations . though the eu called for an immediate cease-fire and appealed to russia to respect georgia 's territorial integrity , the bloc is deeply divided and has avoided taking sides in the caucasus crisis . while leading powers like france , italy and germany have had positive ties with russia , the formerly communist eastern european member states have condemned what they call russian aggression against georgia . during talks on wednesday , eu ministers would discuss a variety of measures including halting eu assistance , cancelling visa talks and reviewing negotiations on a new partnership agreement with moscow , lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas told reuters news agency . some eu countries have called for a european peacekeeping force in the disputed regions , but there has been no indication that russia would accept such a plan . georgia 's membership bid divides nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an attack on one nato member is considered to be an attack on all members meeting tuesday in brussels , nato ambassadors criticized russia for " excessive , disproportionate use of force " and reiterated support for georgia 's eventual membership in the alliance . georgian membership , however , has divided the alliance .
its bid to join was deferred at a summit in bucharest in april , with nato leaders promising that both georgia and ukraine , another former member of the soviet union , would become members at some point in the future . nato has agreed eventually to allow georgia entry into the western alliance .
moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force . " some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , merkel 's spokesman thomas steg said the chancellor will bring a stern message to russian president dmitry medvedev on friday in sochi on the conflict over the breakaway georgian region of south ossetia . the chancellor believes it is " totally unacceptable " for " the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of georgia to be called into question , " steg told a news conference . merkel also believes strongly that georgia 's " sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia are non-negotiable , " steg said . she will " make it clear " to medvedev at the meeting at the black sea resort of sochi , near the disputed abkhazia province , that problems in the caucasus " can not be solved militarily , " steg added . international observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised to push for peaceful conflict resolution with medvedev merkel 's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomacy in the european union to cement the french-brokered ceasefire . on wednesday , france led calls to send in international monitors into the two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was prepared to contribute to peacekeeping arrangements in georgia 's two breakaway regions and to help organize peace talks . " the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia , " ban said in a statement . the eu proposal to send european peacekeepers to the caucasus region has received a mixed response in the 27-member bloc .
some nations have said international peacekeepers would have more credibility in the volatile region while others have called for a rethink of the eu 's ties with russia and a stronger condemnation of moscow 's military offensive against georgia . avoiding blame game the issue highlights a growing divide in the bloc over how best to handle ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divisions are emerging within the eu over the best way to handle the kremlin steg said it was natural for france , which holds the eu 's presidency , to take the lead in brokering a ceasefire but said merkel warned against any hasty assigning of blame for the violent clashes that broke out between russia and georgia last week . " the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments , " steg said . germany , which is highly dependant on russian energy supplies , has been hesitant to blame moscow for the conflict with russia .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also told reporters on wednesday that the eu is best served when it communicates with russia . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " steinmeier said at an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers . politician wants " privileged partnership " with moscow but merkel 's determination to be tough with russian leader medvedev on his country 's military response in georgia was at odds with the views of a veteran member of merkel 's own conservative party who said the eu should press ahead with efforts to bind russia to the bloc . in an interview with news agency reuters on wednesday , ruprecht polenz , head of the foreign policy committee of the german parliament , said the eu should consider offering moscow a " privileged partnership " if it shows a willingness to adopt european values . " i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russia 's future behavior , " polenz , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said . polenz said it would be a mistake to scrap ongoing partnership talks with russia because of its violent conflict with georgia . he did not spell out what such a partnership should look like but polenz told reuters it should be a " far-reaching " agreement contingent on russia initiating reforms in the areas of justice , human rights and political values . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the internal eu dispute over how to deal with moscow seems to be threatening a genuine autumn tempest . diplomatic approach under pressure " i am sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu-russia relations in the future , " finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said drily on wednesday , aug .
13 , ahead of an emergency meeting with eu colleagues on the georgian crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is keen to resolve disputes diplomatically with russia , its key energy supplier since 2004 , the eu has made huge efforts to reach an amicable resolution to any dispute with its biggest neighbor - and its biggest energy supplier . eu heavyweights such as germany argue that such a stance is vital since any move that antagonizes the kremlin will make it harder for the two sides to work together for european peace . it would be better and more effective to " keep channels to moscow and tbilisi open " than to make " strong statements and one-sided condemnations , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said at the brussels emergency meeting . but with many eu members expressing outrage at russia 's actions in georgia , that stance is now coming under real pressure . " i 'm sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia , " estonian foreign minister urmas paet said .
" i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened . " sweden , britain join eu newcomers on russia diplomatic clashes between russia and new eu members such as the baltic states and poland are nothing new . both poland and lithuania initially vetoed talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia because of trade disputes with moscow .
in 2007 , estonia had a bitter row with moscow over the removal of a red army war memorial from tallinn . the eu treated those disputes as essentially bilateral , isolating the troublesome issues and allowing the bloc as a whole to continue its diplomatic approach to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david miliband has accused russia of " blatant agression " against georgia but wednesday 's meeting saw that pattern dramatically altered .
eu veterans and heavyweights such as swedish foreign minister carl bildt and britain 's foreign minister david miliband joined the newcomers in condemning what they see as russia 's " disproportionate " use of force . " some states which were maybe too idealist -lrb- towards russia -rrb- in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger , " paet told german news agency dpa after the meeting . getting eu heavyweights on board a challenge that shift in attitude , if it lasts , has the potential to change the whole dynamic of eu-russia relations . but hard-liners must first overcome the resistance of the eu 's biggest players , germany and france - both of whom have strong commercial links with russia . and with france now holding the eu 's rotating presidency , and set to host a summit with russia in the autumn , the battle over how the eu should deal with moscow promises to be a stormy one . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the idea of having monitors - what you call peacekeeping troops , i would n't call them like that - but european controllers , monitors , facilitators , yes , yes and yes .
that is how europe should be on the ground , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , with saakashvili in tbilisi france , which currently chairs the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in moscow on tuesday to end the fierce six-day conflict between russia and georgia in the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
kouchner accompanied french president nicolas sarkozy on his diplomatic mission to moscow this week .
under the terms of the agreement , moscow is to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
georgian president mikheil saakashvili has also accepted sarkozy 's plan .
despite the peace plan , saakashvili said russian troops were shooting at people and looting in the georgian town of gori early wednesday , in apparent violation of the ceasefire .
earlier , saakasvili told cnn russian troops were moving towards the georgian capital , tbilisi , and trying to encircle the city .
but that account was rejected later by georgian deputy interior minister eka zguladze who said russian troops were not headed to tbilisi .
germany says no time to apportion blame a few eu countries welcomed the french proposal to dispatch international peacekeepers to the two separatist provinces .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier backed the monitoring idea and said the eu should avoid a blame game and focus on how it could play a constructive role to stabilize the caucasus .
" we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days .
the eu must decide which role it wants to play in the future , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister added the only way for the bloc to play a " real role " in the caucasus would be to keep its channels with moscow and tbilisi open , rather than make " one-sided condemnations . "
that view was echoed by german chancellor angela merkel who is reported to be visiting tbilisi next week , her spokesman said on wednesday .
" the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives , for allocating blame , for denouncing anyone or for making final judgements , " thomas steg told reporters in berlin .
steg said the german government welcomed the de facto ceasefire in south ossetia and was making all efforts to ensure it held .
germany stood by the view that georgia 's territorial integrity should not be infringed , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian officials said russian forces were still bombing the strategic town of gori polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was one of several eu ministers to say that " international forces would be more credible . "
italy has already said it is willing to contribute up to 1,000 soldiers to such a force .
" we need an international presence , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
differences remain but differences also emerged over what consequences to draw from russia 's military offensive in georgia .
british foreign secretary david miliband said the eu should decide next month " whether or not and how " to continue talks on closer ties with moscow .
" the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues , " miliband said .
lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas said there must be consequences for russia 's " unacceptable and disproportional " use of force .
with no concrete decisions expected on wednesday , many ministers said the most immediate priority should be to ensure that the ceasefire holds and that humanitarian aid reaches the tens of thousands of people who have displaced by the conflict .
the extraordinary meeting was convened to discuss the latest conflict between georgia - an eu hopeful - and russia , which resents the west 's growing influence on its borders . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 13.08.2008 high-tech suits , training help olympic swimmers break records großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it the suit that gives swimmers their record breaking speed ?
some say it is the high-tech swimsuits that allow swimmers to break old records .
others say top athletes train differently today .
but whatever the reason , the number of world records broken in beijing is unprecedented . world-class swimming is drowning in record-breaking performances .
more than 60 new records have been set so far in the 2008 season , and the olympic competition in beijing is n't even over yet .
feats like those in china 's capital - where 16 world records fell alone in the first of four days of olympic finals - have not been seen since the olympics in 1976 in montreal .
could it be doping ?
new technologies ?
scientific discoveries ?
around the edge of the swimming pool at beijing 's futuristic " water cube " swimming venue , there are many theories .
" what 's happening here , under normal circumstances , is not statistically possible , " germany 's top coach , oerjan madsen , said .
" the times the swimmers are clocking here are knocking the long-term statistics on their head . "
experts in the sport are having a hard time coming up with an explanation .
several factors taken together could be the cause , they say .
" for one thing , there is the suit , " madsen said , referring to speedo 's high-tech , full-length " silver bullet " lzr racer .
" i think the main reason , though , is to be found in training based on science , " madsen said .
" fewer mistakes are made because of it .
more full-time professionals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top us swimmer michael phelps -lrb- center -rrb- broke five world records " there are also more and more full-time professionals in many countries who live from swimming and are able to pursue the sport in a completely different way . "
german international olympic committee vice-president thomas bach struck a similar line , speaking of a combination of the new suits and improved sports science .
" the flood of world records was already expected before the games started , " bach said .
dirk lange , the german coach of south africa 's olympians , named another reason that has always proved a winner at past olympics : " the top people have a killer instinct . "
five world records for phelps a combination of all these factors must be what allowed the us teams in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays to smash the records by huge margins of 3.99 and 4.72 seconds respectively .
the us athletes have worked for years to achieve the perfect butterfly kick .
as a result , top us swimmer michael phelps , who by dint of physique and many other characteristics already is the best all-around swimmer of his time , has achieved unbelievable high speeds on his turns and has had world records in all his five events so far in beijing .
with perfect starts and turns and low-drag , high-buoyancy racing suits , " it became clear we would see a deluge of records , " lange said .
some downplay suit 's effect italian coach alberto castagnetti has called the lzr racer " technological doping . "
but american swimming legend mark spitz , the seven-time gold medal winner from the 1972 munich games , would have none of it .
" if it was the swimming suit , then i 'm buying tiger woods ' golf clubs because it means no matter who the swinger is , i am going to be able to score like that , " he argued .
a high-tech suit could give a swimmer mental confidence but it would be only a part of a winning equation , argued britta steffen , a german swimmer who has broken records wearing adidas products .
" in all the discussions , you should not forget that a suit does not swim on its own .
a person is in each one , and that person can have a good day or a bad day , be well or poorly trained , " she said .
zimbabwean two-time silver medalist kirsty coventry , who herself got one of the records , simply referred to the fun factor .
" the crowd is creating conditions where it is enjoyable to swim .
" the swimmers can just have fun and the pool is very fast , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , with russian president dmitry medvedev in moscow before flying on to tbilisi to hold talks with saakashvili .
moscow had ordered a halt to military operations in georgia earlier in the day . both medvedev and saakashvili reportedly agreed to the eu peace plan , though it has not been finalized and several points of contention still need to be ironed out . on saakashvili 's request , medvedev agreed to remove a clause in the peace document referring talks on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia , separatist provinces in northern georgia with strong ties to russia . " the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt , " said the georgian president early wednesday at a joint news conference following his talks with sarkozy . eu ministers hold crisis talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev called tuesday for a halt to hostilities the six-point peace plan , which calls for an end to hostilities on both sides and a return to pre-conflict positions , is to be reviewed wednesday by eu foreign minister in brussels . both tbilisi and moscow continued to report attacks tuesday even after medvedev had ordered an end to military operations . though the eu called for an immediate cease-fire and appealed to russia to respect georgia 's territorial integrity , the bloc is deeply divided and has avoided taking sides in the caucasus crisis . while leading powers like france , italy and germany have had positive ties with russia , the formerly communist eastern european member states have condemned what they call russian aggression against georgia . during talks on wednesday , eu ministers would discuss a variety of measures including halting eu assistance , cancelling visa talks and reviewing negotiations on a new partnership agreement with moscow , lithuanian foreign minister petras vaitiekunas told reuters news agency . some eu countries have called for a european peacekeeping force in the disputed regions , but there has been no indication that russia would accept such a plan . georgia 's membership bid divides nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an attack on one nato member is considered to be an attack on all members meeting tuesday in brussels , nato ambassadors criticized russia for " excessive , disproportionate use of force " and reiterated support for georgia 's eventual membership in the alliance . georgian membership , however , has divided the alliance .
its bid to join was deferred at a summit in bucharest in april , with nato leaders promising that both georgia and ukraine , another former member of the soviet union , would become members at some point in the future . nato has agreed eventually to allow georgia entry into the western alliance .
moscow is fiercely opposed . fighting broke out in the south ossetian region on friday when georgian troops launched on offensive to reclaim the breakaway territory , which broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . russia responded with military support for the separatists , pouring troops into south ossetia and then into georgia proper . bildunterschrift : dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , the six-day war in the caucasus was a clear victory for russia and its strategic aims in the region .
“ moscow has demonstrated that it is prepared to use military might to further its strategic goals , while the democracies of the west are not … .the west has no stomach for a war with russia to save georgian democracy . ”
the independent added that moscow wanted to get rid of georgian president mikheil saakashvili who is too independently minded and western-oriented for prime minister vladimir putin 's liking .
“ saakashvili had attracted the personal enmity of mr putin , who now wants the georgian president hauled before a war crimes tribunal like saddam hussein . ” berlin 's tageszeitung characterized moscow 's military intervention as “ absolutely disproportionate ” to the conflict at hand and slammed the european union for being too weak in its response . “ it is a glaring violation of the rights of a sovereign state … justice must be done .
what is decisive is how the world community , and above all how the european union positions itself .
nothing can be done with cowardly , wimpy peace appeals . ”
pointing out the need for a common european position , the tageszeitung added that a divided eu , with individual states protecting their own strategic interests would be “ another victory for moscow . ”
the financial times deutschland characterized the conflict in terms of net economic gains and losses . “ the lost of -lrb- breakaway -rrb- provinces abkhazia and south ossetia could be viewed as an advantage for georgia .
in recent years both regions were a huge financial drain for the nation 's leadership .
as -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili was pushing ahead with rapid economic reforms and tried to keep official corruption in check , the problems of territorial conflicts kept escalating and became unsolvable .
if georgia extricates itself from the two provinces , the nation might be able to gain some perspective .
the status of both regions , however , will play an important role . ”
france 's left-leaning le monde commented on the impact of the war in the caucasus for us president george bush .
“ five months before the end of his presidency , president bush has been called to action … georgia , his best friend in the former soviet bloc , has been crushed by the russians .
this georgia , which bush in tbilisi called the “ light of freedom , ” without contemplating the deep offense of his remarks to moscow .
the american president will be haunted by his words , which have left georgia at the mercy of russia 's revisionist mood .
the war in the caucasus is another blow -lrb- to georgia 's democratic reforms -rrb- , which had been at the cornerstone of bush 's foreign policy in his second term in office .
the “ freedom agenda ” that bush envisioned after his re-election in 2004 is perhaps only a grand illusion . ” dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

qian hong-yan wants to make her parents proud with a paralympic medal the large public swimming pool is crowded with early morning swimmers .
twelve-year-old qian hong-yan comes here twice a day .
she lost both legs in a car accident when she was a child .
on land she is confined to a wheelchair , but once she is in the water her swimming is agile and fast .
her ambition is to represent china in the paralympics in 2012 .
if she could win a gold medal , she says , she would make her parents very proud .
her coach , li ke-qiang , understands better than most .
he lost an arm but took silver and bronze medals for china in athens .
he says that when the chinese public see disabled athletes succeed in the olympics , that might really change their image of disabled people .
" in the past , " he said , " people despised the disabled .
they thought they were all beggars , just asking for money . "
" but now , when they see disabled swimmers like these , they can see how hard they 're driving themselves .
and that 's a start . "
' pushed aside ' a sense of pride and achievement is important for everyone , but especially for china 's disabled .
many say they feel totally rejected by family members and the community .
they speak of being labelled a burden and even of being blamed for their disability .
zou-ma 's accident had a devastating effect on her life in a rehabilitation centre in kunming was an attractive young woman called zuo-ma .
now 24 , she lost the use of her legs in a shooting accident at the age of 20 and uses a wheelchair .
the impact on her life was dramatic .
almost immediately after the accident , her husband decided to leave her , she said , and took their baby son with him .
she felt so desperate , she tried to kill herself .
now , four years later , talking about it quickly reduced her to tears .
her story is not unusual .
dr rob cheeley is the general director of " bless china international " , a non-governmental organisation that works with yunnan 's poor and with the disabled .
in under-developed and remote parts of china especially , he said , facilities for the disabled were minimal and social attitudes could be extremely harsh .
" the disabled are at the tail-end of society , " he said .
" they get what 's left over .
there are literally tens of thousands of people being pushed aside and kept in poverty . "
" they ca n't go to school , they ca n't get married and they ca n't get a job .
they 're really social outcasts . "
more compassionate there are slow signs of progress .
many in the chinese government are now trying to provide more opportunities for the disabled , according to dr cheeley , and to challenge negative views .
projects like ' hearts and hands ' are rare in china one project , set up six years ago , provides work for the deaf or those with other disabilities .
called " hearts and hands " , it is a small , friendly but basic operation .
rows of women sit at sewing machines and craft tables making items for export to the west , from aprons and tablecloths to mobile phone covers and make-up bags .
they are paid an average of about 800 yuan a month -lrb- about us $ 115 , £ 57 -rrb- .
the manager , susan wang , says it would be extremely difficult for these women to find jobs anywhere else .
it is a start - but projects like this are still extremely rare , especially in china 's poorer provinces .
the competition for opportunity and new wealth in china is fierce , and the disabled tend to be excluded .
but there is some trickledown effect .
as chinese society gets richer , it is starting to get a little more compassionate as well .

qian hong-yan wants to make her parents proud with a paralympic medal the large public swimming pool is crowded with early morning swimmers .
twelve-year-old qian hong-yan comes here twice a day .
she lost both legs in a car accident when she was a child .
on land she is confined to a wheelchair , but once she is in the water her swimming is agile and fast .
her ambition is to represent china in the paralympics in 2012 .
if she could win a gold medal , she says , she would make her parents very proud .
her coach , li ke-qiang , understands better than most .
he lost an arm but took silver and bronze medals for china in athens .
he says that when the chinese public see disabled athletes succeed in the olympics , that might really change their image of disabled people .
" in the past , " he said , " people despised the disabled .
they thought they were all beggars , just asking for money . "
" but now , when they see disabled swimmers like these , they can see how hard they 're driving themselves .
and that 's a start . "
' pushed aside ' a sense of pride and achievement is important for everyone , but especially for china 's disabled .
many say they feel totally rejected by family members and the community .
they speak of being labelled a burden and even of being blamed for their disability .
zou-ma 's accident had a devastating effect on her life in a rehabilitation centre in kunming was an attractive young woman called zuo-ma .
now 24 , she lost the use of her legs in a shooting accident at the age of 20 and uses a wheelchair .
the impact on her life was dramatic .
almost immediately after the accident , her husband decided to leave her , she said , and took their baby son with him .
she felt so desperate , she tried to kill herself .
now , four years later , talking about it quickly reduced her to tears .
her story is not unusual .
dr rob cheeley is the general director of " bless china international " , a non-governmental organisation that works with yunnan 's poor and with the disabled .
in under-developed and remote parts of china especially , he said , facilities for the disabled were minimal and social attitudes could be extremely harsh .
" the disabled are at the tail-end of society , " he said .
" they get what 's left over .
there are literally tens of thousands of people being pushed aside and kept in poverty . "
" they ca n't go to school , they ca n't get married and they ca n't get a job .
they 're really social outcasts . "
more compassionate there are slow signs of progress .
many in the chinese government are now trying to provide more opportunities for the disabled , according to dr cheeley , and to challenge negative views .
projects like ' hearts and hands ' are rare in china one project , set up six years ago , provides work for the deaf or those with other disabilities .
called " hearts and hands " , it is a small , friendly but basic operation .
rows of women sit at sewing machines and craft tables making items for export to the west , from aprons and tablecloths to mobile phone covers and make-up bags .
they are paid an average of about 800 yuan a month -lrb- about us $ 115 , £ 57 -rrb- .
the manager , susan wang , says it would be extremely difficult for these women to find jobs anywhere else .
it is a start - but projects like this are still extremely rare , especially in china 's poorer provinces .
the competition for opportunity and new wealth in china is fierce , and the disabled tend to be excluded .
but there is some trickledown effect .
as chinese society gets richer , it is starting to get a little more compassionate as well .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- paralympics boost for china 's disabled bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 05:29 gmt , wednesday , 13 august 2008 06:29 uk paralympics boost for china 's disabled the olympic games will be followed by the paralympics and , as the bbc 's jill mcgivering reports from kunming , if chinese athletes perform well , it could help society address long-standing prejudice towards the disabled .
the large public swimming pool is crowded with early morning swimmers .
twelve-year-old qian hong-yan comes here twice a day .
she lost both legs in a car accident when she was a child .
on land she is confined to a wheelchair , but once she is in the water her swimming is agile and fast .
her ambition is to represent china in the paralympics in 2012 .
if she could win a gold medal , she says , she would make her parents very proud .
her coach , li ke-qiang , understands better than most .
he lost an arm but took silver and bronze medals for china in athens .
he says that when the chinese public see disabled athletes succeed in the olympics , that might really change their image of disabled people .
" in the past , " he said , " people despised the disabled .
they thought they were all beggars , just asking for money . "
" but now , when they see disabled swimmers like these , they can see how hard they 're driving themselves .
and that 's a start . "
' pushed aside ' a sense of pride and achievement is important for everyone , but especially for china 's disabled .
many say they feel totally rejected by family members and the community .
they speak of being labelled a burden and even of being blamed for their disability .
in a rehabilitation centre in kunming was an attractive young woman called zuo-ma .
now 24 , she lost the use of her legs in a shooting accident at the age of 20 and uses a wheelchair .
the impact on her life was dramatic .
almost immediately after the accident , her husband decided to leave her , she said , and took their baby son with him .
she felt so desperate , she tried to kill herself .
now , four years later , talking about it quickly reduced her to tears .
her story is not unusual .
dr rob cheeley is the general director of " bless china international " , a non-governmental organisation that works with yunnan 's poor and with the disabled .
in under-developed and remote parts of china especially , he said , facilities for the disabled were minimal and social attitudes could be extremely harsh .
" the disabled are at the tail-end of society , " he said .
" they get what 's left over .
there are literally tens of thousands of people being pushed aside and kept in poverty . "
" they ca n't go to school , they ca n't get married and they ca n't get a job .
they 're really social outcasts . "
more compassionate there are slow signs of progress .
many in the chinese government are now trying to provide more opportunities for the disabled , according to dr cheeley , and to challenge negative views .
one project , set up six years ago , provides work for the deaf or those with other disabilities .
called " hearts and hands " , it is a small , friendly but basic operation .
rows of women sit at sewing machines and craft tables making items for export to the west , from aprons and tablecloths to mobile phone covers and make-up bags .
they are paid an average of about 800 yuan a month -lrb- about us $ 115 , £ 57 -rrb- .
the manager , susan wang , says it would be extremely difficult for these women to find jobs anywhere else .
it is a start - but projects like this are still extremely rare , especially in china 's poorer provinces .
the competition for opportunity and new wealth in china is fierce , and the disabled tend to be excluded .
but there is some trickledown effect .
as chinese society gets richer , it is starting to get a little more compassionate as well .

they are concerned flats being built next to rodney parade will increase traffic and restrict light .
they will raise the issues at a meeting later .
plans for the £ 40m scheme have already been altered .
but wendy straker-jones , who lives next to the site , said : " the changes do n't address the concerns that people have . "
developers , architects and local politicians are expected to join residents at the meeting , being held at the rugby club house .
the development is part of plans to transform rodney parade into a state-of-the-art 15,000-capacity stadium for the newport gwent dragons and newport rugby club . "
it 's like dropping an area of new york into an area that is really victorian two-storey terraces . "
wendy straker-jones the proposed blocks of private and student flats will help to fund the stadium expansion .
new training facilities and a clubhouse will also form part of the scheme .
restaurant and conference facilities , as well as a sports injuries clinic , will be available for local community use .
but ms straker-jones said that while residents knew the development was planned , they were shocked by the scale and height of the proposed towers .
" it 's like dropping an area of new york into an area that is really victorian two-storey terraces , " she said .
marian dudley , who has lived in the area for 40 years , has also written to planners to object to the scale of the project .
" the terraced cottages are going to be swamped and all our light is mainly from the front , " she said .
" my neighbour is only going to get two hours of light a day .
there are only a small number of us , but we are very irate . "
' whole community ' a consultation document published by the rugby clubs in february said : " we believe that incorporating facilities such as student accommodation that benefit the whole community as well as the clubs is the right way forward .
" the central goal of this strategy is to ensure there are ' no surprises ' for anyone at any stage of the process , " it added .
newport city council confirmed they had received a number of letters of objection to the project from residents and councillors .
it is expected to be considered by the planning committee in september .
developers hope to start work before the end of this year with the first phase of the development due to be completed in 2010 .

they are concerned flats being built next to rodney parade will increase traffic and restrict light .
they will raise the issues at a meeting later .
plans for the £ 40m scheme have already been altered .
but wendy straker-jones , who lives next to the site , said : " the changes do n't address the concerns that people have . "
developers , architects and local politicians are expected to join residents at the meeting , being held at the rugby club house .
the development is part of plans to transform rodney parade into a state-of-the-art 15,000-capacity stadium for the newport gwent dragons and newport rugby club .
it 's like dropping an area of new york into an area that is really victorian two-storey terraces .
wendy straker-jones the proposed blocks of private and student flats will help to fund the stadium expansion .
new training facilities and a clubhouse will also form part of the scheme .
restaurant and conference facilities , as well as a sports injuries clinic , will be available for local community use .
but ms straker-jones said that while residents knew the development was planned , they were shocked by the scale and height of the proposed towers .
" it 's like dropping an area of new york into an area that is really victorian two-storey terraces , " she said .
marian dudley , who has lived in the area for 40 years , has also written to planners to object to the scale of the project .
" the terraced cottages are going to be swamped and all our light is mainly from the front , " she said .
" my neighbour is only going to get two hours of light a day .
there are only a small number of us , but we are very irate . "
' whole community ' a consultation document published by the rugby clubs in february said : " we believe that incorporating facilities such as student accommodation that benefit the whole community as well as the clubs is the right way forward .
" the central goal of this strategy is to ensure there are ' no surprises ' for anyone at any stage of the process , " it added .
newport city council confirmed they had received a number of letters of objection to the project from residents and councillors .
it is expected to be considered by the planning committee in september .
developers hope to start work before the end of this year with the first phase of the development due to be completed in 2010 .
newport gwent dragons have been contacted for a comment on the redevelopment .

the route suffers from regular delays and cancellations to passenger services as a result of the limitations of the infrastructure network rail councillor julie girling said : " without the extra track there is a real danger that the growth in new housing will far outstrip new jobs leading to a slowdown in the local economy , more people commuting out of the area and the inevitable knock-on effect of more congestion . "
the track from kemble to swindon is part of the stroud valley line that has a key strategic role in linking gloucestershire and surrounding counties with london and the south east .
it branches from the birmingham to bristol main line south of gloucester , and joins the great western railway route from south wales to london at swindon .
in a statement network rail back the improvement plan .
" the route suffers from regular delays and cancellations to passenger services as a result of the limitations of the infrastructure , " it said .
" at peak times it operates at full capacity , but the infrastructure is unable to support an hourly timetable .
" we believe that the swindon-kemble project offers good value for money and would meet the objectives of improving both performance and capacity . "

mark chapman , 53 , will remain in attica prison , new york , for at least another two years .
chapman told parole board members at a hearing that he planned the killing " with an essentially clear mind " .
a lawyer for lennon 's widow , yoko ono , said she was " very pleased " with the board 's decision .
chapman shot the former beatle as he and wife ono returned to their manhattan apartment building on 8 december 1980 .
he has been in prison for 27 years since pleading guilty to the murder .
the board noted that chapman had a clean disciplinary record since 1994 but said his conduct had " precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals " .
" your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large , " the board added .
a spokesman for the new york correctional services department said chapman was being held in an isolated unit away from other prisoners because of fears for his safety .
chapman , who had a history of mental illness before he committed the murder , was also denied parole in 2000 , 2002 , 2004 and 2006 .
he will be allowed to apply again in 2010 .
