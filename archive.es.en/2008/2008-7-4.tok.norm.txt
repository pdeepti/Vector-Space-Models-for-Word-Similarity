" there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .
the two sides have agreed to meet again in september . shape of future treaty still unclear the talks came a week after eu leaders met russia 's president dmitry medvedev in the siberian oil town of khanty-mansiysk in a meeting hailed as turning a fresh page in often testy relations between moscow and its european neighbors . relations between the two sides are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which came into force in 1997 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.07.2008 eu , russia hold first talks on new partnership pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the european union are looking to seal a new partnership but obstacles remain the european union and russia said on friday they had agreed on what areas should be covered by a wide-ranging partnership treaty without setting a deadline for it . speaking after a first round of talks in brussels on friday , july 4 , the two sides said negotiations on a new pact to replace an agreement signed in 1997 had been " positive " and fruitful but declined to set a timeframe to conclude the deal despite pressure from countries such as germany . " there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .
the two sides have agreed to meet again in september . shape of future treaty still unclear the talks came a week after eu leaders met russia 's president dmitry medvedev in the siberian oil town of khanty-mansiysk in a meeting hailed as turning a fresh page in often testy relations between moscow and its european neighbors . relations between the two sides are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which came into force in 1997 .
both sides now say that it is time to agree a new treaty which would take into account russia 's new strength and the eu 's recent enlargements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new treaty is to reflect russia 's rising power thanks to its energy reserves the new agreement is meant to provide legally- binding rules on how russia , europe 's biggest energy supplier , and the eu , russia 's biggest source of foreign direct investment , should deal with each other in practically all aspects of cooperation . in may this year , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he hoped the new partnership agreement would be negotiated " within a clear timeframe , " insisting russia needed to provide reliable business conditions for foreign investors . but the exact shape of any future agreement is still not clear and both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . human rights and european defense cause problems the eu is also under pressure from its electorates and some eastern european members to make parts of any deal conditional on russian improvements in areas such as human rights , political liberalization and relations with its neighbors , especially georgia . in the past , the kremlin has replied to such calls by accusing the eu of breaching human rights - especially those of russians - in its own member states , and of violating the sovereignty of russia 's ally serbia over the issue of kosovo . there are also issues concerning the state of security in europe and the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- and nato enlargement . moscow froze the cfe treaty - which sets limits on troops , tanks and other military hardware across the continent - in december 2007 and is locked in a stand-off with washington over us plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe .
russia has also complained over nato 's proposed eastward expansion into georgia . russian leader proposes european alternative to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato plans to expand to russia 's eastern border medvedev has proposed a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev said recently while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . eu hoping medvedev will be more pro-europe the meeting last week in khanty-mansiysk gave the eu their first taste of russian diplomacy under new president medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes medvedev is more flexible than vladimir putin eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .
the two sides have agreed to meet again in september . shape of future treaty still unclear the talks came a week after eu leaders met russia 's president dmitry medvedev in the siberian oil town of khanty-mansiysk in a meeting hailed as turning a fresh page in often testy relations between moscow and its european neighbors . relations between the two sides are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which came into force in 1997 .

russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . human rights and european defense cause problems the eu is also under pressure from its electorates and some eastern european members to make parts of any deal conditional on russian improvements in areas such as human rights , political liberalization and relations with its neighbors , especially georgia . in the past , the kremlin has replied to such calls by accusing the eu of breaching human rights - especially those of russians - in its own member states , and of violating the sovereignty of russia 's ally serbia over the issue of kosovo . there are also issues concerning the state of security in europe and the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- and nato enlargement . moscow froze the cfe treaty - which sets limits on troops , tanks and other military hardware across the continent - in december 2007 and is locked in a stand-off with washington over us plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe .

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "

the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .

children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .

if the bridge project goes ahead , dresden 's elbe valley could lose its status in 2009 . dresden 's status was called into question in 2006 because the waldschloesschen bridge now under construction was viewed as a threat to the valuable cultural landscape .
unesco has recommended the bridge be replaced with a tunnel .
voters approved the bridge construction in 2005 , however unesco offered a grace period last year so alternatives could be evaluated .
the unesco world heritage committee at its 32nd meeting this week in quebec , canada " regretted the construction of the bridge underway and urged the authorities to opt for the digging of a tunnel in its stead , " according to a press release .
construction on the 636-meter -lrb- 2,085 foot -rrb- began in november , 2007 after a court dismissed arguments that it would endanger a rare species of bat that lives on the banks of the elbe river .
unesco 's concern with the construction project is that it would mar the eastern german city 's skyline .
still considered " at risk " if the bridge is not stopped , the site will be removed from the world heritage list in 2009 , unesco has said .
meanwhile , the site remains on unesco 's so-called " danger list . "
yet the year-long reprieve is seen as a positive step by those who have organized weekly demonstrations to try and put a halt to the bridge project .
" it 's a victory for the citizens of dresden who have been demonstrating every single monday for the last year , " dresden university architecture professor ralf weber told afp news agency .
dresden 's elbe river valley stretches some 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- from ubigau palace to pillnitz place .
if the valley loses unesco support it would be the first site to be stripped of its world heritage status .
german delegate brigitte ringbeck said dresden is facing a final chance to either cease construction or lose the heritage designation .
a second grace period was extended because the committee recognizes efforts germany has made to maintain unesco sites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.07.2008 opinion : us embassy opening in berlin marks new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new us embassy opens in berlin friday with a festive ceremony and george bush , senior , one of the fathers of german reunification .
dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .
the us has always felt responsible for freedom .
the country is mature enough to share this responsibility with those who know the value of freedom .

dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .
the us has always felt responsible for freedom .
the country is mature enough to share this responsibility with those who know the value of freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.07.2008 opinion : us embassy opening in berlin marks new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new us embassy opens in berlin friday with a festive ceremony and george bush , senior , one of the fathers of german reunification .
dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .
the us has always felt responsible for freedom .
the country is mature enough to share this responsibility with those who know the value of freedom .

two citizens took the case to the federal constitutional court , saying that the calculation sometimes had the paradoxical effect of depriving a party of seats as its proportion of votes nationally rises .
germany uses the mixed member-proportional -lrb- mmp -rrb- system of vote counting .

the parties have learned to try to win as many overhang seats as possible .
the paradox arises when the discrepancy between member and proportional seats reduces .

the smart money would be on a quick trip to the garbage can .
but some bright spark had the idea of spinning the threads into gold . there seems to be no end to what can be bought or sold on internet auction site ebay .
we 've had celebrity cars like juergen klinsmann 's vw beetle and pope benedict xvi 's golf , the penalty kick notes from the germany-argentina world cup 2006 quarter-final , and even a chewed-up piece of gum spat from the mouth of britney spears .
the latest to make it onto the site is a section of artificial hair reputedly lost by british supermodel kate moss while trying to duck paparazzi as she returned to the plush hotel adlon after a night out in berlin last month .
fake hair shed as moss fled paparazzi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hair extensions ca n't be tested for drugs the blonde hair extension , currently being auctioned for 805 euros -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- , according to the friday , july 4 edition of the german bild newspaper , was found by a photographer at the scene .
the photographer , it is reported , plans to donate the proceeds to a german anti-drugs charity .
moss was accused and cautioned by police in britain for possession of cocaine after photos of her allegedly using the drug appeared in a british tabloid .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former president bush , father of current president george w bush , praised germans for reunifying their country in 1990 .
the people of east and west germany had never forgotten that they were one people with one language . recalling the fall of the wall , one of the most dramatic events of his own presidency , he said , " it ended the division of europe . " living history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president george bush , left , took part in the opening ceremony the united states invited 4,500 people , including pilots who flew missions in the 1948-49 berlin airlift , to the opening party which spilled out into cordoned-off areas outside the pale sandstone building . a large outdoor festival near the brandenburg gate will be open to the public on saturday , in the surroundings that are full of history . the us embassy occupied the site in the 1930s .
the holocaust memorial - a stark expanse of tomb-like stones - is next door and commemorates the 6 million jews who died under the nazis . by the time us diplomats moved into the embassy in april 1939 , washington had already recalled its chief envoy to protest the nazis ' anti-semitic pogrom the previous year . the remaining diplomats left in 1941 after germany declared war on the united states . during the cold war , the land was part of the desolate no-man 's land along the berlin wall . a new beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pariser platz and the area around brandeburg was a sea of stars and stripes some diplomats have said the new embassy symbolizes us support for germany during the cold war and improved transatlantic relations following the rift that opened up between the two sides over the us-led invasion of iraq . in a speech on the eve of the inauguration , george bush said he believed us-german ties were stronger than ever . " my son is under a lot of pressure as president of the united states , " he said at the american academy in berlin after receiving the henry kissinger prize .
" one of the things i draw great comfort from is the truly excellent ties with your chancellor for whom i have a lot of respect , " he said of german leader angela merkel . merkel on friday said she wanted to use the occasion to express her " sincere , heartfelt thanks " to the united states for its support of germany , which she believed altered the course of history . a special moment for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to the somewhat bland , tan stone facade of the embassy speaking before the opening ceremony , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too drew on the past and the fact that the opening marked a special moment for germany . " the united states played a decisive role in the fact that the brandenburg gate is open today and the german issue has been settled , " steinmeier said . steinmeier called for the united states and europe to unite on new issues . " a solid new agenda " in the transatlantic relationship was needed , he told a conference organized by a german newspaper , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
the purpose should be to cope with 21st-century challenges . key issues were how to manage resource shortages , arms control and a policy of international responsibilities shared with rising powers such as china , india and brazil , steinmeier said . embassy panned by architecture critics the embassy , designed by california firm moore ruble yudell , took four years to build and ran into a string of problems and bitter wrangling between the berlin city government and american diplomats . it has also been heavily criticized by german architecture critics .
an article in respected german daily suedeutsche zeitung described the embassy building as " fort knox at the brandenburg gate " earlier this year . berlin critic gerwin zohlen called the building a " boring " example of a 1980s style of post-modernism that was already out of date . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 04.07.2008 italy attacked over plan to fingerprint roma and sinti großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu commissioner has called sinti and roma " europe 's forgotten citizens " a plan by the italian government to fingerprint undocumented roma and sinti has sparked outrage among human rights groups and the eu who warn identifying people based on ethnicity can set a dangerous precedent italian prime minister silvio berlusconi 's plan to take a census of all roma and sinti people living in some 700 camps in italy as part of a broader crackdown on crime was slammed by rights groups on thursday , july 3 .
" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "
on wednesday , members of the european parliament attacked the scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian interior minister roberto maroni says the plan will guarantee security to italian citizens " it is inconceivable in a member state of the eu -lrb- that -rrb- a specific social group is targeted by collecting fingerprints , including of minors , as it is happening now in italy with roma communities , " german member of the eu parliament , alexander alvaro said .
" this brings us back to dramatic periods of european history and we appeal to the italian government to step back from this racist exercise of ethnic profiling , " he said .
escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinti and roma peddle wares at a sunday market in rome last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
this week , italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
" europe 's forgotten citizens " but a study released by the european commission this week on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .
roma are particularly exposed to high poverty and unemployment , and those who work usually do so illegally , the report said .
" roma are one of the largest ethnic minorities in the eu , but too often they are europe 's forgotten citizens , " said eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla .
" they face persistent discrimination and far-reaching social exclusion .
the eu and member states have a joint responsibility to end this situation . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .

" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .

but around five minutes of the original were probably still missing , he said .
due to the poor condition of the film stock , it was too early to say how long restoration would take , possmann said .
" it 's taken several years with similar films , " he added .
written by lang and his actress wife thea von harbou , “ metropolis ” was originally three-and-a-half-hours long but was cut into a shorter version since seen by millions worldwide .

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .
researchers at the foundation , which owns the rights to " metropolis , " confirmed that the scenes were original .
" we were overjoyed when we heard about the find , " foundation head helmut possmann told reuters news agency .
" we no longer believed we 'd see this .
time and again we had had calls about supposed footage but were disappointed .
" we 're not being fooled , " he said .
" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .
in terms of understanding what it 's about , we 'll be seeing a new film . "
material expands characters and plot bildunterschrift : the film was n't an initial success around 20 to 25 minutes of footage that fleshes out secondary characters and sheds light on the plot would be added to the film pending restoration , he added .
but around five minutes of the original were probably still missing , he said .
due to the poor condition of the film stock , it was too early to say how long restoration would take , possmann said .
" it 's taken several years with similar films , " he added .
written by lang and his actress wife thea von harbou , “ metropolis ” was originally three-and-a-half-hours long but was cut into a shorter version since seen by millions worldwide .
commercial flop to influential blueprint it was not a commercial success and nearly bankrupted the studio behind it .
according to some estimates , it still ranks as one of the most expensive movies ever made once inflation is factored in .

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .
french president nicolas sarkozy , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german finance minister peer steinbrueck have all warned the ecb to tread carefully as it sizes up future interest rate policy .
minimal increase no reason for concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary general gurria welcomed the move angel gurria , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , said he supported the decision by the ecb to raise euro zone interest rates , insisting it would not affect growth .
" the question of the -lrb- financial -rrb- crisis and economic growth does not depend on a quarter of a point , " told the french television network france 24 .
he said growth instead depended on decisions that national institutions and leaders are prepared to take " in difficult areas such as the budget and economic and fiscal policy . "
gurria added that he was in " total agreement " with the ecb and its president , jean-claude trichet , on the rate hike .
" it 's good because it is a signal to the markets but also to economic players ... to say that ' in the area of monetary policy we 're still there , we 're vigilant , we 're not going to let inflation control the situation , " ' he said .
eu 's economy and workforce will suffer , say unions meanwhile , an umbrella group representing leading european trade unions blasted the ecb interest rate hike , calling it " dangerous " and warning that it could harm european growth .
" in short , the ecb 's decision is dangerous , counterproductive and not necessary , " the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- said in a statement .

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .
french president nicolas sarkozy , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german finance minister peer steinbrueck have all warned the ecb to tread carefully as it sizes up future interest rate policy .
minimal increase no reason for concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary general gurria welcomed the move angel gurria , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , said he supported the decision by the ecb to raise euro zone interest rates , insisting it would not affect growth .
" the question of the -lrb- financial -rrb- crisis and economic growth does not depend on a quarter of a point , " told the french television network france 24 .
he said growth instead depended on decisions that national institutions and leaders are prepared to take " in difficult areas such as the budget and economic and fiscal policy . "
gurria added that he was in " total agreement " with the ecb and its president , jean-claude trichet , on the rate hike .
" it 's good because it is a signal to the markets but also to economic players ... to say that ' in the area of monetary policy we 're still there , we 're vigilant , we 're not going to let inflation control the situation , " ' he said .
eu 's economy and workforce will suffer , say unions meanwhile , an umbrella group representing leading european trade unions blasted the ecb interest rate hike , calling it " dangerous " and warning that it could harm european growth .

by tonnage , germany had led competitors france , the netherlands , new zealand and italy since 2006 .
a federal agency that collects farm data , zmp , said the cheese output was mainly based on the 28 million tons of milk produced annually by germany 's 101,000 dairy farmers , plus a small amount of imported milk .
exports increasing yet even with record exports , dairy farmers remain angry over low prices .
farmers currently get between 27 and 33 cents per liter -lrb- about $ 1.60 to $ 1.90 per gallon -rrb- , depending on the region .
the farmers want 43 cents per liter .
while lidl and aldi , germany 's two largest discount grocery chains , have offered to pay higher prices for fresh milk and butter , there is ongoing concern that the european union plans to switch to a market-driven , quota-free system will put small farmers out of business .
exports of milk products totalled 7 billion euros in 2007 , an increase of 27 percent compared to the previous year .
the trend seems to be continuing in 2008 , with the first quarter showing a 27 percent increase over the same period from the previous year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two citizens took the case to the federal constitutional court , saying that the calculation sometimes had the paradoxical effect of depriving a party of seats as its proportion of votes nationally rises .
germany uses the mixed member-proportional -lrb- mmp -rrb- system of vote counting .
voters choose a bundestag member to represent each of 299 districts and cast a " list vote " to fill 299 more seats , proportional to overall party support .
the distortion can arise when a big party wins a greater fraction of the electoral districts than its proportion of all votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way bundestag seats are filled will change by 2011 the current 612-seat parliament would have had only 597 seats , after the death of one member , if it were not for 15 " overhang " seats won by the member method by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her coalition partners , the social democrats .
the parties have learned to try to win as many overhang seats as possible .
the paradox arises when the discrepancy between member and proportional seats reduces .
a party may end up with fewer seats overall because of the way the seats are distributed state by state .
in 2005 , merkel 's party urged supporters in one district to leave the proportional part of their ballots blank to prevent this .
principle of equality contradicted judges in karlsruhe said this effect contradicted the principle of equality between parties under electoral law , but said there should be no change in the distribution of seats in the current bundestag .
it set a deadline of june 2011 to pass amended electoral legislation .
the calculation method led to " arbitrary results " and these outcomes were by no means rare , the judges said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two citizens took the case to the federal constitutional court , saying that the calculation sometimes had the paradoxical effect of depriving a party of seats as its proportion of votes nationally rises .
germany uses the mixed member-proportional -lrb- mmp -rrb- system of vote counting .
voters choose a bundestag member to represent each of 299 districts and cast a " list vote " to fill 299 more seats , proportional to overall party support .
the distortion can arise when a big party wins a greater fraction of the electoral districts than its proportion of all votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way bundestag seats are filled will change by 2011 the current 612-seat parliament would have had only 597 seats , after the death of one member , if it were not for 15 " overhang " seats won by the member method by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her coalition partners , the social democrats .
the parties have learned to try to win as many overhang seats as possible .
the paradox arises when the discrepancy between member and proportional seats reduces .
a party may end up with fewer seats overall because of the way the seats are distributed state by state .
in 2005 , merkel 's party urged supporters in one district to leave the proportional part of their ballots blank to prevent this .
principle of equality contradicted judges in karlsruhe said this effect contradicted the principle of equality between parties under electoral law , but said there should be no change in the distribution of seats in the current bundestag .
it set a deadline of june 2011 to pass amended electoral legislation .
the calculation method led to " arbitrary results " and these outcomes were by no means rare , the judges said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european press said the rescue signalled the beginning of the end for the farc . two days after her spectacular rescue from the colombian jungle , betancourt was met by president nicolas sarkozy at an airbase near paris on friday , july 4 .
the european press saw clear winners and losers in the hostage ordeal , in which betancourt and 14 other hostages were rescued by the colombian military .
the parisian newspaper figaro said that betancourt 's release signals that the end of the marxist group is in sight .
the newspaper said several events have weakened the group recently , particularly the deaths of manuel marulanda and raul reyes .
the ties between the farc and venezuelan president hugo chavez also led to a loss of credibility , the newspaper said .
" the farc is in a crisis ... we will live to see the end of the last guerrillas in latin america , " the newspaper predicted .
the independent of london also noted that the hostage release was the latest of several blows that " may just hasten the demise of the marxist guerrilla group farc , which has blighted the country 's politics for more than four decades . "
" the freeing of ms. betancourt has removed farc 's biggest bargaining chip to extract the concessions it has long sought - a prisoner exchange involving the release by the government of captured farc rebels in return for the hundreds of hostages held by the group , and creation of a demilitarized safe haven for the group in the south of the country , " the independent wrote .
" increasingly , farc 's existence is a self-perpetuating futility .
its fighting force , now perhaps only 8,000 , is half or less what it was in the group 's heyday , " the newspaper said .
hostage , refugee problems a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that the freeing of betancourt was an important step in the fight against farc terrorism , but that it would be a mistake to think that colombia 's problems have been solved .
" but the war has not been won , " the newspaper wrote .
" the farc has hundreds of hostages in its grip .

four million people live as refugees in their own country .
after sudan , colombia is the country in the world with the most refugees . "
chance for peace spain 's newspaper el pais said that the farc is " in freefall . "
betancourt 's release will help president alvaro uribe win the upcoming elections , the newspaper said .
but it is also an opportunity to bring peace to colombia .
" the return to life of the ex-presidential candidate plants the fundamental question as to whether it will represent the start of a peace process that will put a definitive end to what has been an authentic civil war in rural colombia for more than half of a century . "
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian president alvaro uribe is savoring the attention many newspapers saw both colombia 's uribe and france 's sarkozy as gaining a political boost from betancourt 's release .
the berliner zeitung agreed that uribe comes away from the situation a winner and chavez the loser .
" the winners and losers in this chess game have been determined .
besides uribe , the winner is the government in washington .
the losers leaving the table are venezuela 's president hugo chavez and naturally the left-wing farc rebels .
the end seems near since the release and the hard losses in recent months . "
sarkozy deserves at least some of the credit he will try to take for betancourt being freed by guerrillas , the french left-wing liberation newspaper wrote , in a rare tribute to a right-wing leader .

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .
researchers at the foundation , which owns the rights to " metropolis , " confirmed that the scenes were original .
" we were overjoyed when we heard about the find , " foundation head helmut possmann told reuters news agency .
" we no longer believed we 'd see this .
time and again we had had calls about supposed footage but were disappointed .
" we 're not being fooled , " he said .
" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .
in terms of understanding what it 's about , we 'll be seeing a new film . "
material expands characters and plot bildunterschrift : the film was n't an initial success around 20 to 25 minutes of footage that fleshes out secondary characters and sheds light on the plot would be added to the film pending restoration , he added .
but around five minutes of the original were probably still missing , he said .
due to the poor condition of the film stock , it was too early to say how long restoration would take , possmann said .
" it 's taken several years with similar films , " he added .
written by lang and his actress wife thea von harbou , “ metropolis ” was originally three-and-a-half-hours long but was cut into a shorter version since seen by millions worldwide .
commercial flop to influential blueprint it was not a commercial success and nearly bankrupted the studio behind it .
according to some estimates , it still ranks as one of the most expensive movies ever made once inflation is factored in .
with its cold , monumental vision of a vast mechanized society in the middle of a tumultuous class struggle , " metropolis " forged a template for generations of science fiction cinema , and its enduring influence has been cited on films from " blade runner " to " fahrenheit 451 " and " star wars . "

if the bridge project goes ahead , dresden 's elbe valley could lose its status in 2009 . dresden 's status was called into question in 2006 because the waldschloesschen bridge now under construction was viewed as a threat to the valuable cultural landscape .
unesco has recommended the bridge be replaced with a tunnel .
voters approved the bridge construction in 2005 , however unesco offered a grace period last year so alternatives could be evaluated .
the unesco world heritage committee at its 32nd meeting this week in quebec , canada " regretted the construction of the bridge underway and urged the authorities to opt for the digging of a tunnel in its stead , " according to a press release .
construction on the 636-meter -lrb- 2,085 foot -rrb- began in november , 2007 after a court dismissed arguments that it would endanger a rare species of bat that lives on the banks of the elbe river .
unesco 's concern with the construction project is that it would mar the eastern german city 's skyline .
still considered " at risk " if the bridge is not stopped , the site will be removed from the world heritage list in 2009 , unesco has said .
meanwhile , the site remains on unesco 's so-called " danger list . "
yet the year-long reprieve is seen as a positive step by those who have organized weekly demonstrations to try and put a halt to the bridge project .
" it 's a victory for the citizens of dresden who have been demonstrating every single monday for the last year , " dresden university architecture professor ralf weber told afp news agency .
dresden 's elbe river valley stretches some 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- from ubigau palace to pillnitz place .
if the valley loses unesco support it would be the first site to be stripped of its world heritage status .
german delegate brigitte ringbeck said dresden is facing a final chance to either cease construction or lose the heritage designation .
a second grace period was extended because the committee recognizes efforts germany has made to maintain unesco sites .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "
on wednesday , members of the european parliament attacked the scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian interior minister roberto maroni says the plan will guarantee security to italian citizens " it is inconceivable in a member state of the eu -lrb- that -rrb- a specific social group is targeted by collecting fingerprints , including of minors , as it is happening now in italy with roma communities , " german member of the eu parliament , alexander alvaro said .
" this brings us back to dramatic periods of european history and we appeal to the italian government to step back from this racist exercise of ethnic profiling , " he said .
escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinti and roma peddle wares at a sunday market in rome last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
this week , italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
" europe 's forgotten citizens " but a study released by the european commission this week on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .
roma are particularly exposed to high poverty and unemployment , and those who work usually do so illegally , the report said .
" roma are one of the largest ethnic minorities in the eu , but too often they are europe 's forgotten citizens , " said eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla .
" they face persistent discrimination and far-reaching social exclusion .
the eu and member states have a joint responsibility to end this situation . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a first result , it was agreed to launch direct flights between taiwan and mainland china .
the first flight took off on friday . it ’ s early in the morning at beijing airport .
tourists are preparing to board the first direct flight to the island of taiwan .
among the crowd are mr. and mrs. feng , both 70 years old .
mrs. feng is looking forward to the journey .
“ we are all set for the journey .
we have had our health check-ups .
we have done some exercises so that we are physically fit and do not fall ill , ’ ’ she says .
historic moment the fengs are two among 800 tourists from communist china who were lucky to get hold of tickets for one of the first direct flights to taiwan .
the fengs will be shelling out nearly 1000 euros for the eight-day journey .
this includes hotel expenses , sightseeing and meals .
normally , these two pensioners would never have been able to afford this little vacation .
but this is a gift from their children , who understood how much this journey meant for the two of them - to visit their fellow countrymen in taiwan at least once in their life .
for the fengs this is a landmark moment .
“ with the olympic games coming soon to peking , this flight also has a historic importance , ’ ’ says mrs feng .
yet even without the upcoming olympic games , the flights are historically significant .
they are the first direct flights in over half a century .
a new beginning since the kuomintang fled to taiwan after the civil war in 1949 , relations between mainland china and taiwan have been strained .
beijing considers taiwan a renegade province , and has threatened to wage war if it declares independence .
china was especially suspicious of the last president chen shuibian , who was in favour of an independent taiwan .
relations improved after a new government took over in taiwan in may - it has done away with any policies regarding independence from the mainland .
the direct flights between the mainland and the island were agreed upon as one of the first reconciliatory gestures .
“ our relations with taiwan should begin well .
they will play a big role in the future .
that is good , ” says mrs. feng .
up until now , travellers visiting their relatives always had to change flights at hong kong .
the direct flights have also simplified the lives of businessmen .
the chinese mainland is taiwan ’ s most important business partner , and an increasing number of taiwanese are investing in the mainland .
warm welcome for tourists on either side the fengs have packed their best clothes for the journey . they want to show their best side to their taiwanese compatriots , says mrs. feng . “ this is not just a journey , we have a mission .
we represent peking .
so we must give a good image , ’ ’ she says .
as the plane touches down in taiwan , a warm welcome awaits the passengers .
taiwanese lion dancers , singers in traditional dress , and even a lavish banquet .
after all , this is a new chapter in taiwan-china relations . dw staff 04/07/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

two citizens took the case to the federal constitutional court , saying that the calculation sometimes had the paradoxical effect of depriving a party of seats as its proportion of votes nationally rises .
germany uses the mixed member-proportional -lrb- mmp -rrb- system of vote counting .
voters choose a bundestag member to represent each of 299 districts and cast a " list vote " to fill 299 more seats , proportional to overall party support .
the distortion can arise when a big party wins a greater fraction of the electoral districts than its proportion of all votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way bundestag seats are filled will change by 2011 the current 612-seat parliament would have had only 597 seats , after the death of one member , if it were not for 15 " overhang " seats won by the member method by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her coalition partners , the social democrats .
the parties have learned to try to win as many overhang seats as possible .
the paradox arises when the discrepancy between member and proportional seats reduces .
a party may end up with fewer seats overall because of the way the seats are distributed state by state .
in 2005 , merkel 's party urged supporters in one district to leave the proportional part of their ballots blank to prevent this .
principle of equality contradicted judges in karlsruhe said this effect contradicted the principle of equality between parties under electoral law , but said there should be no change in the distribution of seats in the current bundestag .
it set a deadline of june 2011 to pass amended electoral legislation .
the calculation method led to " arbitrary results " and these outcomes were by no means rare , the judges said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european press said the rescue signalled the beginning of the end for the farc . two days after her spectacular rescue from the colombian jungle , betancourt was met by president nicolas sarkozy at an airbase near paris on friday , july 4 .
the european press saw clear winners and losers in the hostage ordeal , in which betancourt and 14 other hostages were rescued by the colombian military .
the parisian newspaper figaro said that betancourt 's release signals that the end of the marxist group is in sight .
the newspaper said several events have weakened the group recently , particularly the deaths of manuel marulanda and raul reyes .
the ties between the farc and venezuelan president hugo chavez also led to a loss of credibility , the newspaper said .
" the farc is in a crisis ... we will live to see the end of the last guerrillas in latin america , " the newspaper predicted .
the independent of london also noted that the hostage release was the latest of several blows that " may just hasten the demise of the marxist guerrilla group farc , which has blighted the country 's politics for more than four decades . "
" the freeing of ms. betancourt has removed farc 's biggest bargaining chip to extract the concessions it has long sought - a prisoner exchange involving the release by the government of captured farc rebels in return for the hundreds of hostages held by the group , and creation of a demilitarized safe haven for the group in the south of the country , " the independent wrote .
" increasingly , farc 's existence is a self-perpetuating futility .
its fighting force , now perhaps only 8,000 , is half or less what it was in the group 's heyday , " the newspaper said .
hostage , refugee problems a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that the freeing of betancourt was an important step in the fight against farc terrorism , but that it would be a mistake to think that colombia 's problems have been solved .
" but the war has not been won , " the newspaper wrote .
" the farc has hundreds of hostages in its grip .
the attention on betancourt in the last years has distracted general attention from colombia 's largest tragedy .
four million people live as refugees in their own country .
after sudan , colombia is the country in the world with the most refugees . "
chance for peace spain 's newspaper el pais said that the farc is " in freefall . "
betancourt 's release will help president alvaro uribe win the upcoming elections , the newspaper said .
but it is also an opportunity to bring peace to colombia .
" the return to life of the ex-presidential candidate plants the fundamental question as to whether it will represent the start of a peace process that will put a definitive end to what has been an authentic civil war in rural colombia for more than half of a century . "
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian president alvaro uribe is savoring the attention many newspapers saw both colombia 's uribe and france 's sarkozy as gaining a political boost from betancourt 's release .
the berliner zeitung agreed that uribe comes away from the situation a winner and chavez the loser .
" the winners and losers in this chess game have been determined .
besides uribe , the winner is the government in washington .
the losers leaving the table are venezuela 's president hugo chavez and naturally the left-wing farc rebels .
the end seems near since the release and the hard losses in recent months . "
sarkozy deserves at least some of the credit he will try to take for betancourt being freed by guerrillas , the french left-wing liberation newspaper wrote , in a rare tribute to a right-wing leader .

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "

" this brings us back to dramatic periods of european history and we appeal to the italian government to step back from this racist exercise of ethnic profiling , " he said .
escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .

this week , italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
" europe 's forgotten citizens " but a study released by the european commission this week on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .
roma are particularly exposed to high poverty and unemployment , and those who work usually do so illegally , the report said .

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "
on wednesday , members of the european parliament attacked the scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian interior minister roberto maroni says the plan will guarantee security to italian citizens " it is inconceivable in a member state of the eu -lrb- that -rrb- a specific social group is targeted by collecting fingerprints , including of minors , as it is happening now in italy with roma communities , " german member of the eu parliament , alexander alvaro said .
" this brings us back to dramatic periods of european history and we appeal to the italian government to step back from this racist exercise of ethnic profiling , " he said .
escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinti and roma peddle wares at a sunday market in rome last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
this week , italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 04.07.2008 european press review : betancourt 's rescue fatal for the farc großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media has followed the case closely french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday after six years as a captive of farc rebels in colombia .
the european press said the rescue signalled the beginning of the end for the farc . two days after her spectacular rescue from the colombian jungle , betancourt was met by president nicolas sarkozy at an airbase near paris on friday , july 4 .
the european press saw clear winners and losers in the hostage ordeal , in which betancourt and 14 other hostages were rescued by the colombian military .
the parisian newspaper figaro said that betancourt 's release signals that the end of the marxist group is in sight .
the newspaper said several events have weakened the group recently , particularly the deaths of manuel marulanda and raul reyes .
the ties between the farc and venezuelan president hugo chavez also led to a loss of credibility , the newspaper said .
" the farc is in a crisis ... we will live to see the end of the last guerrillas in latin america , " the newspaper predicted .
the independent of london also noted that the hostage release was the latest of several blows that " may just hasten the demise of the marxist guerrilla group farc , which has blighted the country 's politics for more than four decades . "
" the freeing of ms. betancourt has removed farc 's biggest bargaining chip to extract the concessions it has long sought - a prisoner exchange involving the release by the government of captured farc rebels in return for the hundreds of hostages held by the group , and creation of a demilitarized safe haven for the group in the south of the country , " the independent wrote .
" increasingly , farc 's existence is a self-perpetuating futility .
its fighting force , now perhaps only 8,000 , is half or less what it was in the group 's heyday , " the newspaper said .
hostage , refugee problems a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that the freeing of betancourt was an important step in the fight against farc terrorism , but that it would be a mistake to think that colombia 's problems have been solved .
" but the war has not been won , " the newspaper wrote .
" the farc has hundreds of hostages in its grip .
the attention on betancourt in the last years has distracted general attention from colombia 's largest tragedy .
four million people live as refugees in their own country .
after sudan , colombia is the country in the world with the most refugees . "
chance for peace spain 's newspaper el pais said that the farc is " in freefall . "
betancourt 's release will help president alvaro uribe win the upcoming elections , the newspaper said .
but it is also an opportunity to bring peace to colombia .
" the return to life of the ex-presidential candidate plants the fundamental question as to whether it will represent the start of a peace process that will put a definitive end to what has been an authentic civil war in rural colombia for more than half of a century . "
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian president alvaro uribe is savoring the attention many newspapers saw both colombia 's uribe and france 's sarkozy as gaining a political boost from betancourt 's release .
the berliner zeitung agreed that uribe comes away from the situation a winner and chavez the loser .
" the winners and losers in this chess game have been determined .
besides uribe , the winner is the government in washington .
the losers leaving the table are venezuela 's president hugo chavez and naturally the left-wing farc rebels .
the end seems near since the release and the hard losses in recent months . "
sarkozy deserves at least some of the credit he will try to take for betancourt being freed by guerrillas , the french left-wing liberation newspaper wrote , in a rare tribute to a right-wing leader .
" pressure placed by sarkozy certainly convinced the colombian president to do everything possible to free ingrid , " the newspaper said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "

" this brings us back to dramatic periods of european history and we appeal to the italian government to step back from this racist exercise of ethnic profiling , " he said .
escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .

this week , italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
" europe 's forgotten citizens " but a study released by the european commission this week on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .
roma are particularly exposed to high poverty and unemployment , and those who work usually do so illegally , the report said .

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "

escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .

children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .
researchers at the foundation , which owns the rights to " metropolis , " confirmed that the scenes were original .
" we were overjoyed when we heard about the find , " foundation head helmut possmann told reuters news agency .
" we no longer believed we 'd see this .
time and again we had had calls about supposed footage but were disappointed .
" we 're not being fooled , " he said .
" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .
in terms of understanding what it 's about , we 'll be seeing a new film . "

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .
researchers at the foundation , which owns the rights to " metropolis , " confirmed that the scenes were original .
" we were overjoyed when we heard about the find , " foundation head helmut possmann told reuters news agency .
" we no longer believed we 'd see this .
time and again we had had calls about supposed footage but were disappointed .
" we 're not being fooled , " he said .
" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .
in terms of understanding what it 's about , we 'll be seeing a new film . "
material expands characters and plot bildunterschrift : the film was n't an initial success around 20 to 25 minutes of footage that fleshes out secondary characters and sheds light on the plot would be added to the film pending restoration , he added .
but around five minutes of the original were probably still missing , he said .
due to the poor condition of the film stock , it was too early to say how long restoration would take , possmann said .
" it 's taken several years with similar films , " he added .
written by lang and his actress wife thea von harbou , “ metropolis ” was originally three-and-a-half-hours long but was cut into a shorter version since seen by millions worldwide .
commercial flop to influential blueprint it was not a commercial success and nearly bankrupted the studio behind it .
according to some estimates , it still ranks as one of the most expensive movies ever made once inflation is factored in .
with its cold , monumental vision of a vast mechanized society in the middle of a tumultuous class struggle , " metropolis " forged a template for generations of science fiction cinema , and its enduring influence has been cited on films from " blade runner " to " fahrenheit 451 " and " star wars . "
" metropolis , " was the first film to be entered into unesco 's memory of the world register - which aims to preserve cultural achievements of outstanding significance . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team enters the olympic qualifying tournament later this month . kaman received dual citizenship this week , clearing the way for the michigan native to play for germany .
the 26-year-old basketball player has never lived in europe , but his great-grandparents were german , according to media reports .
kaman is one of the nba 's dominant centers .
the 2.13 meter -lrb- 7 foot -rrb- center averaged 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds last season with the clippers .
his scoring potential and height are seen as essential for strengthening the german team , which has not qualified for the olympics since the 1992 barcelona games .
germany 's power duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowitzki wants his team to qualify kaman will join nba star dirk nowitzki on germany 's roster .
nowitzki , who became the first european to win the nba 's most valuable player award , plays for the dallas mavericks .
" this is great news , " nowitzki said of kaman joining the team .
" we 'll be stronger under the baskets with chris . "
" the olympics are simply the greatest thing there is for any athlete , " nowitzki recently told reuters news agency .
" i already get goose bumps just thinking about what it 'd be like walking into the opening ceremony with the germany team .
it 'd be the icing on the cake for me . "
waiting for kaman the clippers have declined to comment on kaman 's olympic plans .
germany 's coach , dirk bauermann , said he was n't worried about kaman possibly missing a warm-up game against canada next week .
bauermann said he hopes that kaman will make it in time for the olympic qualifying event in athens , greece , which will be held july 14-20 .
kaman started on a five-year , $ 52-million contract with the clippers during the 2007-2008 season .
yet he spent much of the season on the bench due to an inflammation in his lower back and a sprained ankle .
the center missed 26 of the team 's last 43 games .
still , bauermann said he thought kaman would be a valuable addition to the team .

the 26-year-old basketball player has never lived in europe , but his great-grandparents were german , according to media reports .
kaman is one of the nba 's dominant centers .
the 2.13 meter -lrb- 7 foot -rrb- center averaged 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds last season with the clippers .

the team enters the olympic qualifying tournament later this month . kaman received dual citizenship this week , clearing the way for the michigan native to play for germany .
the 26-year-old basketball player has never lived in europe , but his great-grandparents were german , according to media reports .
kaman is one of the nba 's dominant centers .
the 2.13 meter -lrb- 7 foot -rrb- center averaged 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds last season with the clippers .
his scoring potential and height are seen as essential for strengthening the german team , which has not qualified for the olympics since the 1992 barcelona games .
germany 's power duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowitzki wants his team to qualify kaman will join nba star dirk nowitzki on germany 's roster .
nowitzki , who became the first european to win the nba 's most valuable player award , plays for the dallas mavericks .
" this is great news , " nowitzki said of kaman joining the team .
" we 'll be stronger under the baskets with chris . "
" the olympics are simply the greatest thing there is for any athlete , " nowitzki recently told reuters news agency .
" i already get goose bumps just thinking about what it 'd be like walking into the opening ceremony with the germany team .
it 'd be the icing on the cake for me . "
waiting for kaman the clippers have declined to comment on kaman 's olympic plans .
germany 's coach , dirk bauermann , said he was n't worried about kaman possibly missing a warm-up game against canada next week .
bauermann said he hopes that kaman will make it in time for the olympic qualifying event in athens , greece , which will be held july 14-20 .
kaman started on a five-year , $ 52-million contract with the clippers during the 2007-2008 season .
yet he spent much of the season on the bench due to an inflammation in his lower back and a sprained ankle .
the center missed 26 of the team 's last 43 games .
still , bauermann said he thought kaman would be a valuable addition to the team .
" i spoke with chris by phone .
he definitely wants to play for germany , " bauermann said .
" he is not just a summer player , he wants to be available for us in the upcoming years as well .
of course , that would be huge . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .
french president nicolas sarkozy , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german finance minister peer steinbrueck have all warned the ecb to tread carefully as it sizes up future interest rate policy .
minimal increase no reason for concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary general gurria welcomed the move angel gurria , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , said he supported the decision by the ecb to raise euro zone interest rates , insisting it would not affect growth .
" the question of the -lrb- financial -rrb- crisis and economic growth does not depend on a quarter of a point , " told the french television network france 24 .
he said growth instead depended on decisions that national institutions and leaders are prepared to take " in difficult areas such as the budget and economic and fiscal policy . "
gurria added that he was in " total agreement " with the ecb and its president , jean-claude trichet , on the rate hike .
" it 's good because it is a signal to the markets but also to economic players ... to say that ' in the area of monetary policy we 're still there , we 're vigilant , we 're not going to let inflation control the situation , " ' he said .
eu 's economy and workforce will suffer , say unions meanwhile , an umbrella group representing leading european trade unions blasted the ecb interest rate hike , calling it " dangerous " and warning that it could harm european growth .

klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .

if the bridge project goes ahead , dresden 's elbe valley could lose its status in 2009 . dresden 's status was called into question in 2006 because the waldschloesschen bridge now under construction was viewed as a threat to the valuable cultural landscape .
unesco has recommended the bridge be replaced with a tunnel .
voters approved the bridge construction in 2005 , however unesco offered a grace period last year so alternatives could be evaluated .
the unesco world heritage committee at its 32nd meeting this week in quebec , canada " regretted the construction of the bridge underway and urged the authorities to opt for the digging of a tunnel in its stead , " according to a press release .
construction on the 636-meter -lrb- 2,085 foot -rrb- began in november , 2007 after a court dismissed arguments that it would endanger a rare species of bat that lives on the banks of the elbe river .

if the bridge project goes ahead , dresden 's elbe valley could lose its status in 2009 . dresden 's status was called into question in 2006 because the waldschloesschen bridge now under construction was viewed as a threat to the valuable cultural landscape .
unesco has recommended the bridge be replaced with a tunnel .
voters approved the bridge construction in 2005 , however unesco offered a grace period last year so alternatives could be evaluated .
the unesco world heritage committee at its 32nd meeting this week in quebec , canada " regretted the construction of the bridge underway and urged the authorities to opt for the digging of a tunnel in its stead , " according to a press release .
construction on the 636-meter -lrb- 2,085 foot -rrb- began in november , 2007 after a court dismissed arguments that it would endanger a rare species of bat that lives on the banks of the elbe river .
unesco 's concern with the construction project is that it would mar the eastern german city 's skyline .
still considered " at risk " if the bridge is not stopped , the site will be removed from the world heritage list in 2009 , unesco has said .
meanwhile , the site remains on unesco 's so-called " danger list . "
yet the year-long reprieve is seen as a positive step by those who have organized weekly demonstrations to try and put a halt to the bridge project .
" it 's a victory for the citizens of dresden who have been demonstrating every single monday for the last year , " dresden university architecture professor ralf weber told afp news agency .

dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .

dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .

from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .

noting that the united states had declined to ratify the 1997 kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas emissions precisely because major developing countries , particularly china and india , were freed from its obligations , they said these countries were now being drawn into global climate change initiatives .
divvying up climate responsibility the outreach five , together with australia , indonesia and korea , are to join g8 members in a meeting on climate change next week at the tokyo summit on the northern japanese island of hokkaido , which starts monday .
the german government officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , indicated the final declaration would refer to a " common but differentiated responsibility " in this regard .
chancellor angela merkel put climate change at the top of the g8 agenda under last year 's german presidency .
at the heiligendamm summit in june last year , she pushed a reluctant us president george w. bush finally to acknowledge the scientific arguments underpinning the climate change debate .
the outreach five group was established at the british g8 summit at gleneagles in 2005 , its members meeting irregularly with g8 members .

" there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .

the european press said the rescue signalled the beginning of the end for the farc . two days after her spectacular rescue from the colombian jungle , betancourt was met by president nicolas sarkozy at an airbase near paris on friday , july 4 .
the european press saw clear winners and losers in the hostage ordeal , in which betancourt and 14 other hostages were rescued by the colombian military .
the parisian newspaper figaro said that betancourt 's release signals that the end of the marxist group is in sight .
the newspaper said several events have weakened the group recently , particularly the deaths of manuel marulanda and raul reyes .
the ties between the farc and venezuelan president hugo chavez also led to a loss of credibility , the newspaper said .
" the farc is in a crisis ... we will live to see the end of the last guerrillas in latin america , " the newspaper predicted .
the independent of london also noted that the hostage release was the latest of several blows that " may just hasten the demise of the marxist guerrilla group farc , which has blighted the country 's politics for more than four decades . "
" the freeing of ms. betancourt has removed farc 's biggest bargaining chip to extract the concessions it has long sought - a prisoner exchange involving the release by the government of captured farc rebels in return for the hundreds of hostages held by the group , and creation of a demilitarized safe haven for the group in the south of the country , " the independent wrote .
" increasingly , farc 's existence is a self-perpetuating futility .
its fighting force , now perhaps only 8,000 , is half or less what it was in the group 's heyday , " the newspaper said .
hostage , refugee problems a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that the freeing of betancourt was an important step in the fight against farc terrorism , but that it would be a mistake to think that colombia 's problems have been solved .
" but the war has not been won , " the newspaper wrote .
" the farc has hundreds of hostages in its grip .
the attention on betancourt in the last years has distracted general attention from colombia 's largest tragedy .
four million people live as refugees in their own country .
after sudan , colombia is the country in the world with the most refugees . "
chance for peace spain 's newspaper el pais said that the farc is " in freefall . "
betancourt 's release will help president alvaro uribe win the upcoming elections , the newspaper said .
but it is also an opportunity to bring peace to colombia .
" the return to life of the ex-presidential candidate plants the fundamental question as to whether it will represent the start of a peace process that will put a definitive end to what has been an authentic civil war in rural colombia for more than half of a century . "
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian president alvaro uribe is savoring the attention many newspapers saw both colombia 's uribe and france 's sarkozy as gaining a political boost from betancourt 's release .
the berliner zeitung agreed that uribe comes away from the situation a winner and chavez the loser .
" the winners and losers in this chess game have been determined .
besides uribe , the winner is the government in washington .
the losers leaving the table are venezuela 's president hugo chavez and naturally the left-wing farc rebels .
the end seems near since the release and the hard losses in recent months . "
sarkozy deserves at least some of the credit he will try to take for betancourt being freed by guerrillas , the french left-wing liberation newspaper wrote , in a rare tribute to a right-wing leader .
" pressure placed by sarkozy certainly convinced the colombian president to do everything possible to free ingrid , " the newspaper said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the photographer , it is reported , plans to donate the proceeds to a german anti-drugs charity .
moss was accused and cautioned by police in britain for possession of cocaine after photos of her allegedly using the drug appeared in a british tabloid .
after the incident , ms. moss is thought to be more careful with her real hair , which can be used in the testing of illicit substances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g8 leaders tackle global issues g8 summit ends with pledges on food , oil and the climate g8 leaders agree to halve emissions by 2050 g8 promises steps against zimbabwe but divisions remain africa 's plight dominates first day of g8 summit international relations -pipe- 04.07.2008 g8 must take the lead on climate change , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will likely dominate the g8 summit bernd pfaffenbach , german chancellor merkel 's point man for next week 's g8 summit , spoke with dw about the pressing issues on the agenda as the world 's leading industrialized powers meet in japan . there will be plenty of topics on the agenda at the g8 summit in japan .
which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .

two citizens took the case to the federal constitutional court , saying that the calculation sometimes had the paradoxical effect of depriving a party of seats as its proportion of votes nationally rises .
germany uses the mixed member-proportional -lrb- mmp -rrb- system of vote counting .
voters choose a bundestag member to represent each of 299 districts and cast a " list vote " to fill 299 more seats , proportional to overall party support .
the distortion can arise when a big party wins a greater fraction of the electoral districts than its proportion of all votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way bundestag seats are filled will change by 2011 the current 612-seat parliament would have had only 597 seats , after the death of one member , if it were not for 15 " overhang " seats won by the member method by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her coalition partners , the social democrats .
the parties have learned to try to win as many overhang seats as possible .
the paradox arises when the discrepancy between member and proportional seats reduces .
a party may end up with fewer seats overall because of the way the seats are distributed state by state .
in 2005 , merkel 's party urged supporters in one district to leave the proportional part of their ballots blank to prevent this .
principle of equality contradicted judges in karlsruhe said this effect contradicted the principle of equality between parties under electoral law , but said there should be no change in the distribution of seats in the current bundestag .

two citizens took the case to the federal constitutional court , saying that the calculation sometimes had the paradoxical effect of depriving a party of seats as its proportion of votes nationally rises .
germany uses the mixed member-proportional -lrb- mmp -rrb- system of vote counting .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 04.07.2008 european press review : betancourt 's rescue fatal for the farc großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media has followed the case closely french-colombian politician ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday after six years as a captive of farc rebels in colombia .
the european press said the rescue signalled the beginning of the end for the farc . two days after her spectacular rescue from the colombian jungle , betancourt was met by president nicolas sarkozy at an airbase near paris on friday , july 4 .
the european press saw clear winners and losers in the hostage ordeal , in which betancourt and 14 other hostages were rescued by the colombian military .
the parisian newspaper figaro said that betancourt 's release signals that the end of the marxist group is in sight .
the newspaper said several events have weakened the group recently , particularly the deaths of manuel marulanda and raul reyes .
the ties between the farc and venezuelan president hugo chavez also led to a loss of credibility , the newspaper said .
" the farc is in a crisis ... we will live to see the end of the last guerrillas in latin america , " the newspaper predicted .
the independent of london also noted that the hostage release was the latest of several blows that " may just hasten the demise of the marxist guerrilla group farc , which has blighted the country 's politics for more than four decades . "
" the freeing of ms. betancourt has removed farc 's biggest bargaining chip to extract the concessions it has long sought - a prisoner exchange involving the release by the government of captured farc rebels in return for the hundreds of hostages held by the group , and creation of a demilitarized safe haven for the group in the south of the country , " the independent wrote .
" increasingly , farc 's existence is a self-perpetuating futility .
its fighting force , now perhaps only 8,000 , is half or less what it was in the group 's heyday , " the newspaper said .
hostage , refugee problems a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that the freeing of betancourt was an important step in the fight against farc terrorism , but that it would be a mistake to think that colombia 's problems have been solved .
" but the war has not been won , " the newspaper wrote .
" the farc has hundreds of hostages in its grip .
the attention on betancourt in the last years has distracted general attention from colombia 's largest tragedy .
four million people live as refugees in their own country .
after sudan , colombia is the country in the world with the most refugees . "
chance for peace spain 's newspaper el pais said that the farc is " in freefall . "
betancourt 's release will help president alvaro uribe win the upcoming elections , the newspaper said .
but it is also an opportunity to bring peace to colombia .
" the return to life of the ex-presidential candidate plants the fundamental question as to whether it will represent the start of a peace process that will put a definitive end to what has been an authentic civil war in rural colombia for more than half of a century . "
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian president alvaro uribe is savoring the attention many newspapers saw both colombia 's uribe and france 's sarkozy as gaining a political boost from betancourt 's release .
the berliner zeitung agreed that uribe comes away from the situation a winner and chavez the loser .
" the winners and losers in this chess game have been determined .
besides uribe , the winner is the government in washington .
the losers leaving the table are venezuela 's president hugo chavez and naturally the left-wing farc rebels .
the end seems near since the release and the hard losses in recent months . "
sarkozy deserves at least some of the credit he will try to take for betancourt being freed by guerrillas , the french left-wing liberation newspaper wrote , in a rare tribute to a right-wing leader .

dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .
the us has always felt responsible for freedom .
the country is mature enough to share this responsibility with those who know the value of freedom .

dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .
french president nicolas sarkozy , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german finance minister peer steinbrueck have all warned the ecb to tread carefully as it sizes up future interest rate policy .
minimal increase no reason for concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary general gurria welcomed the move angel gurria , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , said he supported the decision by the ecb to raise euro zone interest rates , insisting it would not affect growth .
" the question of the -lrb- financial -rrb- crisis and economic growth does not depend on a quarter of a point , " told the french television network france 24 .
he said growth instead depended on decisions that national institutions and leaders are prepared to take " in difficult areas such as the budget and economic and fiscal policy . "
gurria added that he was in " total agreement " with the ecb and its president , jean-claude trichet , on the rate hike .
" it 's good because it is a signal to the markets but also to economic players ... to say that ' in the area of monetary policy we 're still there , we 're vigilant , we 're not going to let inflation control the situation , " ' he said .
eu 's economy and workforce will suffer , say unions meanwhile , an umbrella group representing leading european trade unions blasted the ecb interest rate hike , calling it " dangerous " and warning that it could harm european growth .

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .
french president nicolas sarkozy , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german finance minister peer steinbrueck have all warned the ecb to tread carefully as it sizes up future interest rate policy .
minimal increase no reason for concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary general gurria welcomed the move angel gurria , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , said he supported the decision by the ecb to raise euro zone interest rates , insisting it would not affect growth .

" there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .
the two sides have agreed to meet again in september . shape of future treaty still unclear the talks came a week after eu leaders met russia 's president dmitry medvedev in the siberian oil town of khanty-mansiysk in a meeting hailed as turning a fresh page in often testy relations between moscow and its european neighbors . relations between the two sides are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which came into force in 1997 .
both sides now say that it is time to agree a new treaty which would take into account russia 's new strength and the eu 's recent enlargements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new treaty is to reflect russia 's rising power thanks to its energy reserves the new agreement is meant to provide legally- binding rules on how russia , europe 's biggest energy supplier , and the eu , russia 's biggest source of foreign direct investment , should deal with each other in practically all aspects of cooperation . in may this year , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he hoped the new partnership agreement would be negotiated " within a clear timeframe , " insisting russia needed to provide reliable business conditions for foreign investors . but the exact shape of any future agreement is still not clear and both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . human rights and european defense cause problems the eu is also under pressure from its electorates and some eastern european members to make parts of any deal conditional on russian improvements in areas such as human rights , political liberalization and relations with its neighbors , especially georgia . in the past , the kremlin has replied to such calls by accusing the eu of breaching human rights - especially those of russians - in its own member states , and of violating the sovereignty of russia 's ally serbia over the issue of kosovo . there are also issues concerning the state of security in europe and the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- and nato enlargement . moscow froze the cfe treaty - which sets limits on troops , tanks and other military hardware across the continent - in december 2007 and is locked in a stand-off with washington over us plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe .
russia has also complained over nato 's proposed eastward expansion into georgia . russian leader proposes european alternative to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato plans to expand to russia 's eastern border medvedev has proposed a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev said recently while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . eu hoping medvedev will be more pro-europe the meeting last week in khanty-mansiysk gave the eu their first taste of russian diplomacy under new president medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes medvedev is more flexible than vladimir putin eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both sides now say that it is time to agree a new treaty which would take into account russia 's new strength and the eu 's recent enlargements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new treaty is to reflect russia 's rising power thanks to its energy reserves the new agreement is meant to provide legally- binding rules on how russia , europe 's biggest energy supplier , and the eu , russia 's biggest source of foreign direct investment , should deal with each other in practically all aspects of cooperation . in may this year , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he hoped the new partnership agreement would be negotiated " within a clear timeframe , " insisting russia needed to provide reliable business conditions for foreign investors . but the exact shape of any future agreement is still not clear and both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . human rights and european defense cause problems the eu is also under pressure from its electorates and some eastern european members to make parts of any deal conditional on russian improvements in areas such as human rights , political liberalization and relations with its neighbors , especially georgia . in the past , the kremlin has replied to such calls by accusing the eu of breaching human rights - especially those of russians - in its own member states , and of violating the sovereignty of russia 's ally serbia over the issue of kosovo . there are also issues concerning the state of security in europe and the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- and nato enlargement . moscow froze the cfe treaty - which sets limits on troops , tanks and other military hardware across the continent - in december 2007 and is locked in a stand-off with washington over us plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe .
russia has also complained over nato 's proposed eastward expansion into georgia . russian leader proposes european alternative to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato plans to expand to russia 's eastern border medvedev has proposed a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev said recently while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . eu hoping medvedev will be more pro-europe the meeting last week in khanty-mansiysk gave the eu their first taste of russian diplomacy under new president medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes medvedev is more flexible than vladimir putin eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .

but around five minutes of the original were probably still missing , he said .
due to the poor condition of the film stock , it was too early to say how long restoration would take , possmann said .
" it 's taken several years with similar films , " he added .

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .
researchers at the foundation , which owns the rights to " metropolis , " confirmed that the scenes were original .
" we were overjoyed when we heard about the find , " foundation head helmut possmann told reuters news agency .
" we no longer believed we 'd see this .
time and again we had had calls about supposed footage but were disappointed .
" we 're not being fooled , " he said .
" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .
in terms of understanding what it 's about , we 'll be seeing a new film . "
material expands characters and plot bildunterschrift : the film was n't an initial success around 20 to 25 minutes of footage that fleshes out secondary characters and sheds light on the plot would be added to the film pending restoration , he added .
but around five minutes of the original were probably still missing , he said .
due to the poor condition of the film stock , it was too early to say how long restoration would take , possmann said .
" it 's taken several years with similar films , " he added .
written by lang and his actress wife thea von harbou , “ metropolis ” was originally three-and-a-half-hours long but was cut into a shorter version since seen by millions worldwide .
commercial flop to influential blueprint it was not a commercial success and nearly bankrupted the studio behind it .
according to some estimates , it still ranks as one of the most expensive movies ever made once inflation is factored in .
with its cold , monumental vision of a vast mechanized society in the middle of a tumultuous class struggle , " metropolis " forged a template for generations of science fiction cinema , and its enduring influence has been cited on films from " blade runner " to " fahrenheit 451 " and " star wars .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .
the us has always felt responsible for freedom .
the country is mature enough to share this responsibility with those who know the value of freedom .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .
the two sides have agreed to meet again in september . shape of future treaty still unclear the talks came a week after eu leaders met russia 's president dmitry medvedev in the siberian oil town of khanty-mansiysk in a meeting hailed as turning a fresh page in often testy relations between moscow and its european neighbors . relations between the two sides are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which came into force in 1997 .
both sides now say that it is time to agree a new treaty which would take into account russia 's new strength and the eu 's recent enlargements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new treaty is to reflect russia 's rising power thanks to its energy reserves the new agreement is meant to provide legally- binding rules on how russia , europe 's biggest energy supplier , and the eu , russia 's biggest source of foreign direct investment , should deal with each other in practically all aspects of cooperation . in may this year , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he hoped the new partnership agreement would be negotiated " within a clear timeframe , " insisting russia needed to provide reliable business conditions for foreign investors . but the exact shape of any future agreement is still not clear and both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . human rights and european defense cause problems the eu is also under pressure from its electorates and some eastern european members to make parts of any deal conditional on russian improvements in areas such as human rights , political liberalization and relations with its neighbors , especially georgia . in the past , the kremlin has replied to such calls by accusing the eu of breaching human rights - especially those of russians - in its own member states , and of violating the sovereignty of russia 's ally serbia over the issue of kosovo . there are also issues concerning the state of security in europe and the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- and nato enlargement . moscow froze the cfe treaty - which sets limits on troops , tanks and other military hardware across the continent - in december 2007 and is locked in a stand-off with washington over us plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe .

" all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev said recently while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . eu hoping medvedev will be more pro-europe the meeting last week in khanty-mansiysk gave the eu their first taste of russian diplomacy under new president medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes medvedev is more flexible than vladimir putin eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union .

noting that the united states had declined to ratify the 1997 kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas emissions precisely because major developing countries , particularly china and india , were freed from its obligations , they said these countries were now being drawn into global climate change initiatives .
divvying up climate responsibility the outreach five , together with australia , indonesia and korea , are to join g8 members in a meeting on climate change next week at the tokyo summit on the northern japanese island of hokkaido , which starts monday .
the german government officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , indicated the final declaration would refer to a " common but differentiated responsibility " in this regard .
chancellor angela merkel put climate change at the top of the g8 agenda under last year 's german presidency .
at the heiligendamm summit in june last year , she pushed a reluctant us president george w. bush finally to acknowledge the scientific arguments underpinning the climate change debate .

" there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .
the two sides have agreed to meet again in september . shape of future treaty still unclear the talks came a week after eu leaders met russia 's president dmitry medvedev in the siberian oil town of khanty-mansiysk in a meeting hailed as turning a fresh page in often testy relations between moscow and its european neighbors . relations between the two sides are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which came into force in 1997 .
both sides now say that it is time to agree a new treaty which would take into account russia 's new strength and the eu 's recent enlargements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new treaty is to reflect russia 's rising power thanks to its energy reserves the new agreement is meant to provide legally- binding rules on how russia , europe 's biggest energy supplier , and the eu , russia 's biggest source of foreign direct investment , should deal with each other in practically all aspects of cooperation . in may this year , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he hoped the new partnership agreement would be negotiated " within a clear timeframe , " insisting russia needed to provide reliable business conditions for foreign investors . but the exact shape of any future agreement is still not clear and both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . human rights and european defense cause problems the eu is also under pressure from its electorates and some eastern european members to make parts of any deal conditional on russian improvements in areas such as human rights , political liberalization and relations with its neighbors , especially georgia . in the past , the kremlin has replied to such calls by accusing the eu of breaching human rights - especially those of russians - in its own member states , and of violating the sovereignty of russia 's ally serbia over the issue of kosovo . there are also issues concerning the state of security in europe and the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- and nato enlargement . moscow froze the cfe treaty - which sets limits on troops , tanks and other military hardware across the continent - in december 2007 and is locked in a stand-off with washington over us plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe .
russia has also complained over nato 's proposed eastward expansion into georgia . russian leader proposes european alternative to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato plans to expand to russia 's eastern border medvedev has proposed a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev said recently while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . eu hoping medvedev will be more pro-europe the meeting last week in khanty-mansiysk gave the eu their first taste of russian diplomacy under new president medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes medvedev is more flexible than vladimir putin eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is nothing more harmful for any negotiating process than a deadline , " russian envoy to the eu , vladimir chizhov told a news conference with his eu counterpart , eu commission director general eneko landaburu . landaburu said he shared chizhov 's assessment .
the two sides have agreed to meet again in september . shape of future treaty still unclear the talks came a week after eu leaders met russia 's president dmitry medvedev in the siberian oil town of khanty-mansiysk in a meeting hailed as turning a fresh page in often testy relations between moscow and its european neighbors . relations between the two sides are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which came into force in 1997 .
both sides now say that it is time to agree a new treaty which would take into account russia 's new strength and the eu 's recent enlargements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new treaty is to reflect russia 's rising power thanks to its energy reserves the new agreement is meant to provide legally- binding rules on how russia , europe 's biggest energy supplier , and the eu , russia 's biggest source of foreign direct investment , should deal with each other in practically all aspects of cooperation . in may this year , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he hoped the new partnership agreement would be negotiated " within a clear timeframe , " insisting russia needed to provide reliable business conditions for foreign investors . but the exact shape of any future agreement is still not clear and both sides differ on what form a new agreement should take .
russia wants a more general plan mapped on the one which expired last year , while the eu insists on a more detailed pact , with precise wording on energy and security issues . human rights and european defense cause problems the eu is also under pressure from its electorates and some eastern european members to make parts of any deal conditional on russian improvements in areas such as human rights , political liberalization and relations with its neighbors , especially georgia . in the past , the kremlin has replied to such calls by accusing the eu of breaching human rights - especially those of russians - in its own member states , and of violating the sovereignty of russia 's ally serbia over the issue of kosovo . there are also issues concerning the state of security in europe and the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- and nato enlargement . moscow froze the cfe treaty - which sets limits on troops , tanks and other military hardware across the continent - in december 2007 and is locked in a stand-off with washington over us plans for a missile defense shield in eastern europe .
russia has also complained over nato 's proposed eastward expansion into georgia . russian leader proposes european alternative to nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato plans to expand to russia 's eastern border medvedev has proposed a common security structure for europe outside of nato , arguing that neither the western alliance nor the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- were currently in a position to guarantee security for all of europe . " all issues of european security , including the planned us anti-missile defense , should be clarified together , " medvedev said recently while reiterating calls for a pan-european security conference including participation by the us . eu hoping medvedev will be more pro-europe the meeting last week in khanty-mansiysk gave the eu their first taste of russian diplomacy under new president medvedev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes medvedev is more flexible than vladimir putin eu commissioner for external relations benita ferrero-waldner said " medvedev is very serious about cooperating more closely with the european union . " brussels-based diplomats hope medvedev will prove a more flexible partner than his predecessor vladimir putin , whose bellicose line aggravated relations with the eu 's post-soviet member states . poland and lithuania vetoed earlier attempts at an agreement because of bilateral trade rows and russia 's entanglement in the so-called frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova . medvedev has shown no inclination to exacerbate things , but press statements by his top advisors have criticized attempts by eu member states to " politicize " relations and manipulate the eu . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the bridge project goes ahead , dresden 's elbe valley could lose its status in 2009 . dresden 's status was called into question in 2006 because the waldschloesschen bridge now under construction was viewed as a threat to the valuable cultural landscape .
unesco has recommended the bridge be replaced with a tunnel .
voters approved the bridge construction in 2005 , however unesco offered a grace period last year so alternatives could be evaluated .
the unesco world heritage committee at its 32nd meeting this week in quebec , canada " regretted the construction of the bridge underway and urged the authorities to opt for the digging of a tunnel in its stead , " according to a press release .
construction on the 636-meter -lrb- 2,085 foot -rrb- began in november , 2007 after a court dismissed arguments that it would endanger a rare species of bat that lives on the banks of the elbe river .
unesco 's concern with the construction project is that it would mar the eastern german city 's skyline .
still considered " at risk " if the bridge is not stopped , the site will be removed from the world heritage list in 2009 , unesco has said .
meanwhile , the site remains on unesco 's so-called " danger list . "
yet the year-long reprieve is seen as a positive step by those who have organized weekly demonstrations to try and put a halt to the bridge project .
" it 's a victory for the citizens of dresden who have been demonstrating every single monday for the last year , " dresden university architecture professor ralf weber told afp news agency .
dresden 's elbe river valley stretches some 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- from ubigau palace to pillnitz place .
if the valley loses unesco support it would be the first site to be stripped of its world heritage status .
german delegate brigitte ringbeck said dresden is facing a final chance to either cease construction or lose the heritage designation .
a second grace period was extended because the committee recognizes efforts germany has made to maintain unesco sites .
germany maintains 32 of the 851 unesco heritage sites around the world . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .
french president nicolas sarkozy , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german finance minister peer steinbrueck have all warned the ecb to tread carefully as it sizes up future interest rate policy .
minimal increase no reason for concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary general gurria welcomed the move angel gurria , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , said he supported the decision by the ecb to raise euro zone interest rates , insisting it would not affect growth .
" the question of the -lrb- financial -rrb- crisis and economic growth does not depend on a quarter of a point , " told the french television network france 24 .
he said growth instead depended on decisions that national institutions and leaders are prepared to take " in difficult areas such as the budget and economic and fiscal policy . "
gurria added that he was in " total agreement " with the ecb and its president , jean-claude trichet , on the rate hike .
" it 's good because it is a signal to the markets but also to economic players ... to say that ' in the area of monetary policy we 're still there , we 're vigilant , we 're not going to let inflation control the situation , " ' he said .
eu 's economy and workforce will suffer , say unions meanwhile , an umbrella group representing leading european trade unions blasted the ecb interest rate hike , calling it " dangerous " and warning that it could harm european growth .
" in short , the ecb 's decision is dangerous , counterproductive and not necessary , " the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" it 's the european economy and european workers that risk paying the price for this . "

construction on the 636-meter -lrb- 2,085 foot -rrb- began in november , 2007 after a court dismissed arguments that it would endanger a rare species of bat that lives on the banks of the elbe river .

if the bridge project goes ahead , dresden 's elbe valley could lose its status in 2009 . dresden 's status was called into question in 2006 because the waldschloesschen bridge now under construction was viewed as a threat to the valuable cultural landscape .
unesco has recommended the bridge be replaced with a tunnel .
voters approved the bridge construction in 2005 , however unesco offered a grace period last year so alternatives could be evaluated .
the unesco world heritage committee at its 32nd meeting this week in quebec , canada " regretted the construction of the bridge underway and urged the authorities to opt for the digging of a tunnel in its stead , " according to a press release .
construction on the 636-meter -lrb- 2,085 foot -rrb- began in november , 2007 after a court dismissed arguments that it would endanger a rare species of bat that lives on the banks of the elbe river .
unesco 's concern with the construction project is that it would mar the eastern german city 's skyline .
still considered " at risk " if the bridge is not stopped , the site will be removed from the world heritage list in 2009 , unesco has said .
meanwhile , the site remains on unesco 's so-called " danger list . "
yet the year-long reprieve is seen as a positive step by those who have organized weekly demonstrations to try and put a halt to the bridge project .
" it 's a victory for the citizens of dresden who have been demonstrating every single monday for the last year , " dresden university architecture professor ralf weber told afp news agency .
dresden 's elbe river valley stretches some 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- from ubigau palace to pillnitz place .
if the valley loses unesco support it would be the first site to be stripped of its world heritage status .
german delegate brigitte ringbeck said dresden is facing a final chance to either cease construction or lose the heritage designation .

dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .
the us has always felt responsible for freedom .
the country is mature enough to share this responsibility with those who know the value of freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 04.07.2008 opinion : us embassy opening in berlin marks new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new us embassy opens in berlin friday with a festive ceremony and george bush , senior , one of the fathers of german reunification .
dw 's uta thofern says the occasion merits a positive look back at us-german ties . in an event laden with symbolism , us ambassador william timken will on friday , july 4 , open the new american embassy on pariser platz , next to the brandenburg gate , and right in the heart of berlin 's historic center .
for many americans , it marks the fulfilment of a dream - a dream of peace and freedom in europe and a goal the us has worked towards for almost a century .
the first world war marked the beginning of america 's involvement in europe , the virtual end of the doctrine of non-intervention and the complete separation of the " new " world from the " old . "
the first big catastrophe of the 20th century was also the beginning of political globalization .
it 's been 90 years since american president woodrow wilson laid down the fundament for the league of nations with his 14-point peace plan for europe , realizing that only an internationally agreed cooperation could hold the chance of permanently ending conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uta thofern it 's an american tragedy that the league of nations failed - not least because the us did not participate in it and that , of all countries , it was the us that in the following decades violated the principles of self-determination of nations and intervention with an international mandate .
a mixture of missionary " goodwill , " born out of america 's own historic experience , and an absolute right to be independent has too often resulted in defiant actions and risky go-it-alone decisions - the iraq war is the most dramatic example .
undisputed credit for european unification but that does n't change the fact that the us decisively influenced the history of europe in the 20th century and indeed overwhelmingly positively .
neither the holocaust nor the stalinist dictatorships in eastern european countries , which were not allowed to belong to a free europe for a long time , would have ended had it not been for the us .
german reunification - the trigger for the continuation of european unity - took place largely thanks to american post-war policies and , in the end , to the unambiguous stance of george bush , senior .
of course , you can always find something to complain about - reunited germany still has economic and social problems , the new eu member states still suffer partly from deep economic burdens rooted in the past and do n't behave the way " old europe " would like them to .
and you could argue that the european union , given the lack of approval among its citizens , is currently in a state of free fall .
it 's all true and yet possible to solve peacefully within the existing framework of rules and alliances .
a look back at the battlefields of the last century , the two-time destruction of large swathes of europe and the decades-long suppression of many european nations puts the difficulties of the present into perspective .
it 's largely due to the us and its military involvement that europe is today , without a doubt , able to solve conflicts diplomatically and peacefully .
center of europe , in the heart of berlin germany profited the most from america 's involvement .
from the marshall plan , the economic rebuilding of west germany , the berlin air lift to the decades-long presence of american troops to protect against soviet aggression and the complete support of german reunification - the us never let the germans down because germany was for them the key to peace and freedom in europe .
seen in this context , the opening of the new american embassy brings things full circle .
and this is not about a return but a new beginning .
when the historic building on the pariser platz square was occupied in 1939 , the us had already pulled its ambassador out of nazi germany .
william timken will be the first american representative to take office in the heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
the coming years should show whether a new beginning is possible in german-us and indeed in trans-atlantic relations .
common values as successor to gerhard schroeder , german chancellor angela merkel turned a new page in german-us relations , healing the rift that opened over the iraq war and yet remaining critical .
it 's possible she could once again work and cooperate much closely together with president george bush 's predecessor .
the us has always felt responsible for freedom .
the country is mature enough to share this responsibility with those who know the value of freedom .

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "
on wednesday , members of the european parliament attacked the scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian interior minister roberto maroni says the plan will guarantee security to italian citizens " it is inconceivable in a member state of the eu -lrb- that -rrb- a specific social group is targeted by collecting fingerprints , including of minors , as it is happening now in italy with roma communities , " german member of the eu parliament , alexander alvaro said .
" this brings us back to dramatic periods of european history and we appeal to the italian government to step back from this racist exercise of ethnic profiling , " he said .
escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinti and roma peddle wares at a sunday market in rome last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
this week , italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
" europe 's forgotten citizens " but a study released by the european commission this week on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .
roma are particularly exposed to high poverty and unemployment , and those who work usually do so illegally , the report said .
" roma are one of the largest ethnic minorities in the eu , but too often they are europe 's forgotten citizens , " said eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla .
" they face persistent discrimination and far-reaching social exclusion .
the eu and member states have a joint responsibility to end this situation . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european press said the rescue signalled the beginning of the end for the farc . two days after her spectacular rescue from the colombian jungle , betancourt was met by president nicolas sarkozy at an airbase near paris on friday , july 4 .
the european press saw clear winners and losers in the hostage ordeal , in which betancourt and 14 other hostages were rescued by the colombian military .
the parisian newspaper figaro said that betancourt 's release signals that the end of the marxist group is in sight .
the newspaper said several events have weakened the group recently , particularly the deaths of manuel marulanda and raul reyes .
the ties between the farc and venezuelan president hugo chavez also led to a loss of credibility , the newspaper said .
" the farc is in a crisis ... we will live to see the end of the last guerrillas in latin america , " the newspaper predicted .
the independent of london also noted that the hostage release was the latest of several blows that " may just hasten the demise of the marxist guerrilla group farc , which has blighted the country 's politics for more than four decades . "
" the freeing of ms. betancourt has removed farc 's biggest bargaining chip to extract the concessions it has long sought - a prisoner exchange involving the release by the government of captured farc rebels in return for the hundreds of hostages held by the group , and creation of a demilitarized safe haven for the group in the south of the country , " the independent wrote .
" increasingly , farc 's existence is a self-perpetuating futility .
its fighting force , now perhaps only 8,000 , is half or less what it was in the group 's heyday , " the newspaper said .
hostage , refugee problems a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid betancourt arrived in paris on friday the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that the freeing of betancourt was an important step in the fight against farc terrorism , but that it would be a mistake to think that colombia 's problems have been solved .
" but the war has not been won , " the newspaper wrote .
" the farc has hundreds of hostages in its grip .
the attention on betancourt in the last years has distracted general attention from colombia 's largest tragedy .
four million people live as refugees in their own country .
after sudan , colombia is the country in the world with the most refugees . "
chance for peace spain 's newspaper el pais said that the farc is " in freefall . "
betancourt 's release will help president alvaro uribe win the upcoming elections , the newspaper said .
but it is also an opportunity to bring peace to colombia .
" the return to life of the ex-presidential candidate plants the fundamental question as to whether it will represent the start of a peace process that will put a definitive end to what has been an authentic civil war in rural colombia for more than half of a century . "
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian president alvaro uribe is savoring the attention many newspapers saw both colombia 's uribe and france 's sarkozy as gaining a political boost from betancourt 's release .
the berliner zeitung agreed that uribe comes away from the situation a winner and chavez the loser .
" the winners and losers in this chess game have been determined .
besides uribe , the winner is the government in washington .
the losers leaving the table are venezuela 's president hugo chavez and naturally the left-wing farc rebels .
the end seems near since the release and the hard losses in recent months . "
sarkozy deserves at least some of the credit he will try to take for betancourt being freed by guerrillas , the french left-wing liberation newspaper wrote , in a rare tribute to a right-wing leader .

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

which issues do you think stand out ?
bernd pfaffenbach : g8 summits are always marked by a large variety of topics .
the skill lies in structuring the topics in such a way that they are easy to manage .
but i think climate change will be a huge issue at this year 's summit .
we germans are satisfied with the agenda because it strongly reflects , draws upon and continues with our program from last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany .
you said climate change was a big topic at last year 's summit .
however the japanese hosts have played down expectations this year .
do you think the summit declaration will fall far short of the goals issued by last year 's g8 summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pfaffenbach says the g8 needs to show leadership i do n't think so ; we would n't like that at all .
i do n't think the japanese can afford to rein in their ambitions so much as to create a setback compared to last year 's summit .
of course , talks will be difficult .
but i think we 've prepared ourselves quite well .
in the end , it will all depend on the deftness of the g8 heads of state and government leaders to draw the emerging economies into the process .
our position is that the g8 must show a certain leadership on this issue .
that means respecting what we agreed on at last year 's summit in germany - that there 's a common yet differentiated reasonability of the whole world and that we as the world 's leading industrialized nations must do more than the developing nations in the short and mid-term .
another big issue will be soaring oil prices .
that was the case at the g8 summit in 2004 .
at the time , the summit agreed on a transparency initiative pushed by the germans .
but not much has happened since . apparently the g8 ca n't halt runaway oil prices ?
it 's always difficult to change the oil price with the push of a button .
it 's in no one 's interest - not even in the oil producing nations ' - that the industrialized countries are brought to their knees and that their wealth is exhausted .
that 's why it 's good if their own money , their oil revenues , are once again invested back in our countries and that the economy functions smoothly again and common interests come together again .
the g8 ca n't put the brakes on spiraling food prices either .
that 's a new topic on the agenda .
the g8 is n't as affected by this crisis ; it has hit the poor harder .
what kind of message can the g8 deliver here ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skyrocketing prices of food have led to riots around the world in the short term , it 's important to give money to the poorest .
germany has earmarked over half a billion this year for food aid .
but in the end , structural causes for the crisis need to be tackled .
it 's especially important to reduce the dependence of developing nations on deliveries from the industrialized world .
that can only happen if rural structures are strengthened in the developing world .
we want to do all this and we have concrete plans for it in the final declaration of the summit . interview : henrik boehme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 04.07.2008 long-lost " metropolis " reels hint at fritz lang 's original vision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's vision of a mechanical society caught in a class struggle may be seen in its entirety a long-lost original cut of the 1927 silent film " metropolis " found in an argentine film museum was shown to journalists for the first time .
the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .
researchers at the foundation , which owns the rights to " metropolis , " confirmed that the scenes were original .
" we were overjoyed when we heard about the find , " foundation head helmut possmann told reuters news agency .
" we no longer believed we 'd see this .
time and again we had had calls about supposed footage but were disappointed .
" we 're not being fooled , " he said .
" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .
in terms of understanding what it 's about , we 'll be seeing a new film . "

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .

the cut reveals some the extent of director fritz lang 's original vision . the celluloid of the german classic was in private hands for 80 years and then was in the museum of cinema in buenos aires where it was discovered in april with never before seen scratched images .
museum director paula felix-didier said theirs is the only copy of german director fritz lang 's complete film .
three reels , edited out and long thought lost , were part of the discovery of the film that depicts a 21st century world divided between an underworld working class and the above-ground thinkers who control them .
buenos aires film distributor adolfo z. wilson acquired a long version of " metropolis " in 1928 which survived as a copy , and finally ended up in the archive of a local film museum , said felix-didier .
rediscovered reels deemed authentic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lang 's original vision may finally be realized a dvd of the version was brought to the friedrich wilhelm murnau foundation in wiesbaden , germany , for analysis .
researchers at the foundation , which owns the rights to " metropolis , " confirmed that the scenes were original .
" we were overjoyed when we heard about the find , " foundation head helmut possmann told reuters news agency .
" we no longer believed we 'd see this .
time and again we had had calls about supposed footage but were disappointed .
" we 're not being fooled , " he said .
" the film can now be shown more or less as lang originally intended it .
in terms of understanding what it 's about , we 'll be seeing a new film . "
material expands characters and plot bildunterschrift : the film was n't an initial success around 20 to 25 minutes of footage that fleshes out secondary characters and sheds light on the plot would be added to the film pending restoration , he added .
but around five minutes of the original were probably still missing , he said .
due to the poor condition of the film stock , it was too early to say how long restoration would take , possmann said .
" it 's taken several years with similar films , " he added .
written by lang and his actress wife thea von harbou , “ metropolis ” was originally three-and-a-half-hours long but was cut into a shorter version since seen by millions worldwide .
commercial flop to influential blueprint it was not a commercial success and nearly bankrupted the studio behind it .
according to some estimates , it still ranks as one of the most expensive movies ever made once inflation is factored in .
with its cold , monumental vision of a vast mechanized society in the middle of a tumultuous class struggle , " metropolis " forged a template for generations of science fiction cinema , and its enduring influence has been cited on films from " blade runner " to " fahrenheit 451 " and " star wars . "
" metropolis , " was the first film to be entered into unesco 's memory of the world register - which aims to preserve cultural achievements of outstanding significance . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team enters the olympic qualifying tournament later this month . kaman received dual citizenship this week , clearing the way for the michigan native to play for germany .
the 26-year-old basketball player has never lived in europe , but his great-grandparents were german , according to media reports .
kaman is one of the nba 's dominant centers .
the 2.13 meter -lrb- 7 foot -rrb- center averaged 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds last season with the clippers .
his scoring potential and height are seen as essential for strengthening the german team , which has not qualified for the olympics since the 1992 barcelona games .

nowitzki , who became the first european to win the nba 's most valuable player award , plays for the dallas mavericks .
" this is great news , " nowitzki said of kaman joining the team .
" we 'll be stronger under the baskets with chris . "

" i already get goose bumps just thinking about what it 'd be like walking into the opening ceremony with the germany team .
it 'd be the icing on the cake for me . "
waiting for kaman the clippers have declined to comment on kaman 's olympic plans .
germany 's coach , dirk bauermann , said he was n't worried about kaman possibly missing a warm-up game against canada next week .
bauermann said he hopes that kaman will make it in time for the olympic qualifying event in athens , greece , which will be held july 14-20 .
kaman started on a five-year , $ 52-million contract with the clippers during the 2007-2008 season .
yet he spent much of the season on the bench due to an inflammation in his lower back and a sprained ankle .
the center missed 26 of the team 's last 43 games .
still , bauermann said he thought kaman would be a valuable addition to the team .
" i spoke with chris by phone .
he definitely wants to play for germany , " bauermann said .

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .
" the interest rate move is very small , it is rather symbolic , " he told the german sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" in terms of the real economy , regarding production and employment , that is , the move will hardly have any effects .
he added that the move would not lead to a slowdown of the economy and consumers would not feel its impact .
" monetary processes are taking a long time until they find their way into the system , " he said .
thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .
however , the european central bank 's decision sends a " clear signal for price stability , " german economy minister michael glos said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos looked ahead to the effects on stability and jobs " growth and jobs can only be secured in the long-term on the basis of stable prices , " glos said in a statement .
" the best contribution a central bank can make toward achieving these goals is a credible monetary policy oriented toward stability , " he added .
bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .
" one must ask oneself if a rate increase is the right means of tackling an inflation that above all comes from the high oil price , " ruerep said in an interview with der tagesspiegel daily .
" given the expected economic slowdown , i would not have taken this step , " the paper quoted him as saying .
ruerup told the paper that as long as the ecb did not begin a cycle of rate hikes it would not be a problem for economic activity .
french president nicolas sarkozy , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and german finance minister peer steinbrueck have all warned the ecb to tread carefully as it sizes up future interest rate policy .
minimal increase no reason for concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oecd secretary general gurria welcomed the move angel gurria , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , said he supported the decision by the ecb to raise euro zone interest rates , insisting it would not affect growth .
" the question of the -lrb- financial -rrb- crisis and economic growth does not depend on a quarter of a point , " told the french television network france 24 .
he said growth instead depended on decisions that national institutions and leaders are prepared to take " in difficult areas such as the budget and economic and fiscal policy . "
gurria added that he was in " total agreement " with the ecb and its president , jean-claude trichet , on the rate hike .
" it 's good because it is a signal to the markets but also to economic players ... to say that ' in the area of monetary policy we 're still there , we 're vigilant , we 're not going to let inflation control the situation , " ' he said .
eu 's economy and workforce will suffer , say unions meanwhile , an umbrella group representing leading european trade unions blasted the ecb interest rate hike , calling it " dangerous " and warning that it could harm european growth .
" in short , the ecb 's decision is dangerous , counterproductive and not necessary , " the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- said in a statement .

deutsche bank 's chief european economist thomas mayer told reuters news agency that the increase in borrowing costs risked pushing the economy towards a downswing while christian dreger from the berlin-based institute for economic research believed the economic fallout from the move would be minimal .
" the consequences for economic activity will be limited , so long as -lrb- the ecb -rrb- keeps to one or two steps , " said dreger .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the diw research institute , agreed that that there would be hardly any impact felt from the ecb decision .

thursday 's decision to raise borrowing costs , according to ecb president jean-claude trichet , was " to prevent broadly based second-round effects " as a result of rising inflation feeding through to a push for higher wages .
new rate doubles ecb target at just over 4 percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation .

bert ruerup , chairman of the german government 's panel of economic advisers , said that it was questionable whether the european central bank made the right choice in raising rates a quarter point .

by tonnage , germany had led competitors france , the netherlands , new zealand and italy since 2006 .
a federal agency that collects farm data , zmp , said the cheese output was mainly based on the 28 million tons of milk produced annually by germany 's 101,000 dairy farmers , plus a small amount of imported milk .
exports increasing yet even with record exports , dairy farmers remain angry over low prices .
farmers currently get between 27 and 33 cents per liter -lrb- about $ 1.60 to $ 1.90 per gallon -rrb- , depending on the region .
the farmers want 43 cents per liter .
while lidl and aldi , germany 's two largest discount grocery chains , have offered to pay higher prices for fresh milk and butter , there is ongoing concern that the european union plans to switch to a market-driven , quota-free system will put small farmers out of business .
exports of milk products totalled 7 billion euros in 2007 , an increase of 27 percent compared to the previous year .
the trend seems to be continuing in 2008 , with the first quarter showing a 27 percent increase over the same period from the previous year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are very worried about discrimination according to race or religion , " marco impagliazzo , president the community of sant 'egidio , said at a press conference in rome on thursday .
" this approach violates italian and european law and calls to mind painful memories , such as the vichy regime of -lrb- nazi-collaborating , world war ii -rrb- france , " impagliazzo said .
he handed out a copy of one camp dweller 's form , which contained his photograph , his fingerprint , and the words " roma from serbia " and " orthodox " filled in under the headings " ethnic origin " and " religion . "
on wednesday , members of the european parliament attacked the scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian interior minister roberto maroni says the plan will guarantee security to italian citizens " it is inconceivable in a member state of the eu -lrb- that -rrb- a specific social group is targeted by collecting fingerprints , including of minors , as it is happening now in italy with roma communities , " german member of the eu parliament , alexander alvaro said .
" this brings us back to dramatic periods of european history and we appeal to the italian government to step back from this racist exercise of ethnic profiling , " he said .
escalating tensions the latest measure comes a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinti and roma peddle wares at a sunday market in rome last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
this week , italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
" europe 's forgotten citizens " but a study released by the european commission this week on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .
roma are particularly exposed to high poverty and unemployment , and those who work usually do so illegally , the report said .
" roma are one of the largest ethnic minorities in the eu , but too often they are europe 's forgotten citizens , " said eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla .
" they face persistent discrimination and far-reaching social exclusion .
the eu and member states have a joint responsibility to end this situation . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the survey of 1,000 adults , to mark the 60th anniversary of the nhs , reveals discomfort with different health policies across the devolved nations .
seven out of 10 said the differences mattered , although the government ruled out any change to english charges .
charging has been removed in wales , is set to disappear in scotland and is under review in northern ireland . "
prescription charges provide a valuable contribution to the nhs in england " department of health spokesman four-way split of the nhs prescription charging is the most obvious divergence of nhs policy since responsibility for healthcare was given to the welsh and northern ireland assemblies , and the scottish parliament .
in england , each item costs £ 7.10 , raising approximately £ 430m for health service funds .
only 12 % of prescriptions are actually paid for - the vast majority are covered by exemptions for children , pensioners and those with long-lasting medical conditions such as epilepsy .
prescriptions have been free since 2007 in wales , and will be free from 2011 onwards in scotland .
in northern ireland , the issue is " under review " .
people who answered the bbc poll of more than 1,000 adults were more likely to call for the abolition of charging if they lived outside england - 84 % from scotland , wales and northern ireland , compared with 73 % in england itself .
lower waits this is by no means the only way in which the nhs has become different depending in which part of the uk you live .
waiting times have fallen faster and further in england compared with scotland and wales , while scotland is the only place to provide free personal care to the elderly .
in total , 71 % of those questioned felt that these differences " mattered " , and this was a view found most often in older people and women .
a spokesman for the department of health said that no changes to english prescription charges were on the way .
" prescription charges provide a valuable contribution to the nhs in england , they raised £ 430m in 2007-08 .
" abolishing them would significantly reduce the money available to deliver other health priorities . "
she added that the nhs remained united by the " same vision and values " across the uk , but that devolution had given each country the " freedom " to make decisions about the specific health problems affecting its population .
the uk 's four health ministers released a statement on thursday " reaffirming " their commitment to the same " core nhs principles " .
these included providing high quality services based on clinical need , not the ability to pay , yet providing value for money for the uk taxpayer .
but beth taylor , of the royal pharmaceutical society of great britain , said the current situation needed to be reviewed urgently .
" there are clear disadvantages under existing arrangements , particularly for non-exempt patients , such as asthma and arthritis sufferers , who require long-term medication for multiple chronic conditions .

the survey of 1,000 adults , to mark the 60th anniversary of the nhs , reveals discomfort with different health policies across the devolved nations .
seven out of 10 said the differences mattered , although the government ruled out any change to english charges .
charging has been removed in wales , is set to disappear in scotland and is under review in northern ireland .
prescription charges provide a valuable contribution to the nhs in england department of health spokesman four-way split of the nhs prescription charging is the most obvious divergence of nhs policy since responsibility for healthcare was given to the welsh and northern ireland assemblies , and the scottish parliament .
in england , each item costs £ 7.10 , raising approximately £ 430m for health service funds .
only 12 % of prescriptions are actually paid for - the vast majority are covered by exemptions for children , pensioners and those with long-lasting medical conditions such as epilepsy .
prescriptions have been free since 2007 in wales , and will be free from 2011 onwards in scotland .
in northern ireland , the issue is " under review " .
people who answered the bbc poll of more than 1,000 adults were more likely to call for the abolition of charging if they lived outside england - 84 % from scotland , wales and northern ireland , compared with 73 % in england itself .
lower waits this is by no means the only way in which the nhs has become different depending in which part of the uk you live .
waiting times have fallen faster and further in england compared with scotland and wales , while scotland is the only place to provide free personal care to the elderly .
in total , 71 % of those questioned felt that these differences " mattered " , and this was a view found most often in older people and women .
a spokesman for the department of health said that no changes to english prescription charges were on the way .
" prescription charges provide a valuable contribution to the nhs in england , they raised £ 430m in 2007-08 .
" abolishing them would significantly reduce the money available to deliver other health priorities . "
she added that the nhs remained united by the " same vision and values " across the uk , but that devolution had given each country the " freedom " to make decisions about the specific health problems affecting its population .
the uk 's four health ministers released a statement on thursday " reaffirming " their commitment to the same " core nhs principles " .
these included providing high quality services based on clinical need , not the ability to pay , yet providing value for money for the uk taxpayer .
but beth taylor , of the royal pharmaceutical society of great britain , said the current situation needed to be reviewed urgently .
" there are clear disadvantages under existing arrangements , particularly for non-exempt patients , such as asthma and arthritis sufferers , who require long-term medication for multiple chronic conditions .
" there is a case for abolition of prescription charges in england . "

but post devolution it has become clear that very different paths are being followed by england , scotland , wales and northern ireland .
is this important ?
yes , it seems .
a bbc poll of more than 1,000 people shows that seven in 10 believe it matters that people get a different service depending on where they live .
so what do the four nhs 's look like ?
england the department of health arguably has the hardest job of all .
responsible for providing care to about 50m of the 60m people in the uk , it has set about making the nhs more effective by creating a marketplace .
in echoes of the tories ' internal market , labour has created buyers , the primary care trusts , and sellers , nhs trusts which run hospitals .
waiting time targets england - 18 weeks by end of 2008 scotland - 18 weeks by end of 2011 wales - 26 weeks by end of 2009 northern ireland - 13 weeks by march 2009 the nations compared in graphics patients are treated as consumers and have been given choice over where they receive treatment , while funding has been overhauled so that hospitals and other health centres get paid per patient treated .
what is more , private sector providers have been invited in to compete with nhs trusts for patients .
the result ?
dramatic improvements in waiting times that the other nations have tried to replicate , but a complete breakdown in the relationship between the medical profession and ministers .
it means by the end of the year , patients will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks of gp referrals - the shortest waiting time in the uk .
more recently , ministers have turned their attentions to gps .
family doctors have been forced to open for longer , while the review of the nhs by health minister lord darzi is expected to pave the way for doctors to be housed in super-surgeries known as polyclinics .
but to date , there has been limited reform of social care .
that is likely to be rectified in the next year with a key policy paper due to be published .
under pressure , ministers have already ruled out the so-called free personal care provided in scotland .
instead , many experts have suggested some form of top-up system whereby the state provides a basic level with people allowed to use their own money to buy extra .
scotland in many ways , scotland is the polar opposite of england .
there is no split between purchaser and buyer with 15 health boards responsible for both commissioning and providing services .
and use of the private sector is kept to a minimum with nhs treatment only contracted out where the health service is unable to provide it .
the model of care was created five years ago and led to a reduction in managers , with senior doctors taking a lead in overseeing care .
it means the clashes between the medical profession and politicians seen south of the border are relatively rare .
but progress on waiting times has been much slower .
with scottish ministers promising 18-week waits only by 2011 - three years after the target in england .
health spending per head england - £ 1,676 scotland - £ 1,919 wales - £ 1,758 northern ireland - £ 1,770 however , scotland was widely praised for its decision to give free personal care to the elderly .
elsewhere in the uk , if an individual has assets of more than £ 22,250 they have to pay for basic help such as cleaning , washing and dressing .
but the wisdom of the policy has been questioned recently with experts saying it is not sustainable and many patients complaining local authorities are rationing care .
wales wales has grabbed the attention for its decision to scrap prescription charging .
the change in 2007 has had reverberations across the uk .
scotland has already said it will follow suit and is in the process of phasing out charges , northern ireland is reviewing them , while england , to much criticism , has said it will not follow suit .
wales is also leading the way on the widely unpopular hospital car park charges .
they will be phased out by 2011 .
prescription charging england - £ 7.10 scotland - charges being phased out by 2011 wales - no charge since april 2007 northern ireland - under review meanwhile , much good work has been achieved in the area of public health with the close alignment between the 22 local authority boundaries and nhs boards playing a key role in this proactive approach .
it has meant improvements to school nutrition and child obesity programmes have been introduced long before they took off elsewhere .
but while wales has received favourable headlines for these policies , it has also suffered its fair share of attacks .
the welsh government has been perhaps most vulnerable over waiting times .
during the election campaign last year , opposition parties were quick to point out waits for treatments had increased since devolution .
ministers have responded by setting their own waiting target - 26 weeks by the end of 2009 .
northern ireland while the polyclinics debate has being raging in england , it may come as a surprise to learn that northern ireland has been experimenting with something very similar in recent years .
parts of the country , in particular in belfast , have set up the so-called super-surgeries .
this has seen gps , nurses and social care staff working side-by-side in large health centres .
life expectancy england - men 77.2 , women 81.5 scotland - men 74.6 , women 79.6 wales - men 76.6 , women 80.9 northern ireland - men 76.1 , women 81 this is not quite as radical as some of the centres being proposed in england , which will see a host of hospital care also included .
but it does mark a sea-change in nhs provision , which since 1948 has tended to be split down distinct professional lines .
it has also meant many of the clashes seen in the other countries between councils and nhs trusts over the care of patients released from hospital have been avoided .
the model of care is born from the fact that each of the five trusts have responsibility for both social care and nhs care .
but in many other respects , nhs policy has developed at a much slower pace than elsewhere because of the political situation which has meant only limited periods of self-rule .

the coins were thought to have been buried as a religious offering .
dr hunter said : " a series of strange things have also been found recently .

district councillors recommended last month that after weeks of consultation with local residents , none of the sites was suitable .
but more than 200 people who packed chippenham 's olympiad leisure centre on thursday were told that the search for alternatives would now begin .
the council needs to relocate gypsies camped illegally at minety .
' in turmoil ' the council tried to move the group on in 2007 but was told by the government to provide somewhere else for them to go .
the six locations considered included two each in wootton bassett , calne and chippenham .
many residents at thursday night 's meeting were relieved that the sites were rejected .
i really ca n't see why they ca n't just leave us alone and try to mould us a little bit more into the community gypsy community member but a member of the gypsy community told the bbc that the decision left them in " turmoil " " we 're none the wiser .
" we 've been there five years and we 're no further forwards than when we first moved there , " he said .
" obviously , nobody wants to see any site near them .
" we 're already settled there , so i really ca n't see why they ca n't just leave us alone and try to mould us a little bit more into the community for the sake of the kids and everybody on the site . "
verina hyland , whose stables back on to the minety site and who was hoping her gypsy neighbours would be moved , was also upset that the issue was back to square one .
" six sites identified .
six sites that score higher on the criteria than minety ever could and yet they 've been rejected summarily .
i feel totally betrayed , " she said .

the swiss bank , which has been among the worst hit by the credit crunch , had been expected to report a loss of about 5bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 4.9bn ; £ 2.5bn -rrb- .
but ubs said a 3bn swiss franc tax credit " in connection with the losses to date " would offset further losses from its investment banking business .
the results for the second quarter will be released on 12 august .
rising shares in addition to the tax credit , ubs said : " the results reflect positive contributions from global wealth management and business banking and from global asset management , offset by a loss in the investment bank " .
however , it added : " further market deterioration led to writedowns and losses on previously disclosed investment bank risk positions . "
ubs shares opened up 7.5 % following the statement , recovering from the record lows earlier in the week .
the swiss bank 's reputation for financial prudence has been damaged recently by the sub-prime crisis which has seen it make writedowns of more than $ 37bn on assets linked to mortgage debt .
it has sold businesses as well as raising fresh capital twice : once from the singapore sovereign wealth fund gic and an unnamed middle eastern investor and once from its existing shareholders .
in its statement , ubs assured investors that it had " no need to raise new equity " .
but the bank confirmed that clients had continued to withdraw money from the bank in the past three months .
" this was most pronounced in april but improved in may and june , in particular for global wealth management and business banking , " it said .

the swiss bank , which has been among the worst hit by the credit crunch , had been expected to report a loss of about 5bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 4.9bn ; £ 2.5bn -rrb- .
but ubs said a 3bn swiss franc tax credit " in connection with the losses to date " would offset further losses from its investment banking business .
the results for the second quarter will be released on 12 august .
rising shares in addition to the tax credit , ubs said : " the results reflect positive contributions from global wealth management and business banking and from global asset management , offset by a loss in the investment bank " .
however , it added : " further market deterioration led to writedowns and losses on previously disclosed investment bank risk positions . "
ubs shares opened up 7.5 % following the statement , recovering from the record lows earlier in the week .
the swiss bank 's reputation for financial prudence has been damaged recently by the sub-prime crisis which has seen it make writedowns of more than $ 37bn on assets linked to mortgage debt .
it has sold businesses as well as raising fresh capital twice : once from the singapore sovereign wealth fund gic and an unnamed middle eastern investor and once from its existing shareholders .
in its statement , ubs assured investors that it had " no need to raise new equity " .
but the bank confirmed that clients had continued to withdraw money from the bank in the past three months .

one of the largest fires has swept through about 50,000 acres of forest along the famous big sur coastline between san francisco and los angeles .
some fire officials have questioned whether the state can cope .
as americans celebrate independence day , californians are being urged to show restraint with traditional fireworks displays .
more than 1,000 fires are burning over half a million acres of california countryside , and the flames have now claimed their first life - a 63-year-old volunteer firefighter in the north of the state .
most of the fires are in sparsely populated areas .
still , more than 8,000 homes are at risk and people in parts of three counties have been ordered to evacuate .
members of california 's national guard have been drafted in to help .
john scherrei , chief of the santa barbara fire department , says firefighters are hard pressed to cope .
" could we use more resources ?
absolutely .
california is stretched thin , " he told the associated press news agency .
" we have requests in for additional resources , and we do n't know how long we can hold on to what we have . "
