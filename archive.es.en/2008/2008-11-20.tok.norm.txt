but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 20.11.2008 experimental germany fall to england reserves in berlin friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalscorers john terry and matthew upson celebrate the 2-1 win in berlin england captain john terry helped gift an experimental germany team a comical equalizer and then scored the winner as an england second-string kept up their team 's run of fine form with a 2-1 friendly victory in berlin . the logic of playing international friendlies during the rough-and-tumble of domestic league seasons is often questioned by those who see these extra burdens on players ' stamina and fitness as meaningless , even dangerous , fixtures .
but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger concurred .

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
germany 's own package comprises 20 billion euros , comprised mainly of cuts to payroll levies decided in october and 12 billion euros , mainly in tax rebates for new-car buyers and soft loans , decided nov .

" what we need is a coordinated european union response , big enough , bold enough to work in the short term , yet strategic and sustainable enough to turn the crisis into an opportunity in the longer term , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said thursday .
" the plan will be a timely , targeted and temporary fiscal impulse . "
barroso said the financial panacea would not be a one-size-fits-all solution , but would use all flexibility available under eu budget rules .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy .

" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.11.2008 new study reveals what makes europeans happy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danes and finns are europe 's happiest people , according to the survey wealth does not automatically make people in europe happier , according to a quality-of-life survey conducted in all 27 european union member states .
but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision was a harsh blow to the german electronic band kraftwerk . electronic pioneers kraftwerk had successfully sued german rap producer moses pelham for using a two-second sample from their 1977 track " metal on metal " in the rhythm sequence in the song " nur mir " by sabrina setlur that appeared in 1997 .
the case was heard and upheld by a hamburg state court which ruled in kraftwerk 's favor , saying pelham was guilty as reusing even the shortest bit of a song infringed on copyright .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling was a blow to kraftwerk but on thursday , nov .
20 , germany 's highest civil court in karlsruhe overturned the hamburg ruling in a case that could have far-reaching implications for the music industry .

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
germany 's own package comprises 20 billion euros , comprised mainly of cuts to payroll levies decided in october and 12 billion euros , mainly in tax rebates for new-car buyers and soft loans , decided nov .

' flexible ' stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso insists tight coordination among eu member states is a no-brainer in brussels , the commission declined to comment on the size of the eu stimulus package , despite german economy minister michael glos commenting wednesday that the deal would be worth around 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- .
" what we need is a coordinated european union response , big enough , bold enough to work in the short term , yet strategic and sustainable enough to turn the crisis into an opportunity in the longer term , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said thursday .
" the plan will be a timely , targeted and temporary fiscal impulse . "
barroso said the financial panacea would not be a one-size-fits-all solution , but would use all flexibility available under eu budget rules .
" everybody suffers from the crisis and everybody needs treatment , but not everyone needs the same pill , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

latvia ready for talks with eu , imf over aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president valdis zatlers wants imf aid for latvia after iceland received the green light from the imf , latvia said that it was to launch formal talks with the eu and imf on financial aid to cushion the baltic nation from its deepening economic crisis prime minister ivars godmanis said the goal of talking to the european commission and the international monetary fund would be to " stabilize the financial system " but declined to say when official negotiations could kick off . he added that " processes connected with a certain bank " would be included in the negotiations but did not elaborate . latvia , which broke free from the crumbling soviet union in 1991 , has enjoyed a reputation as an economic " tiger , " notably since joining the eu . but after several years of double-digit growth , the country of 2.3 million people is now grappling with a recession as its once-robust domestic demand slumps in the face of high inflation , tighter domestic credit rules and the global economic crisis . the latvian economy shrank by 4.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2007 , and official data show the country is suffering the sharpest recession in the eu . for the full year , the latvian central bank expects the economy to shrink by 1.5-1.7 percent and by 3.5-3.9 percent in 2009 .
iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .
" we will be back in 2010 . "
haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .
9 .
" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .
the three biggest banks were nationalized in early october , and the debacle could cost up to an estimated 85 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 20.11.2008 experimental germany fall to england reserves in berlin friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalscorers john terry and matthew upson celebrate the 2-1 win in berlin england captain john terry helped gift an experimental germany team a comical equalizer and then scored the winner as an england second-string kept up their team 's run of fine form with a 2-1 friendly victory in berlin . the logic of playing international friendlies during the rough-and-tumble of domestic league seasons is often questioned by those who see these extra burdens on players ' stamina and fitness as meaningless , even dangerous , fixtures .
but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger concurred .

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .

" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .

" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .

20 , in hamburger abendblatt . she added that the amount of child pornography on the web is spiraling out of control . " the numbers are exploding - the distribution of such pictures doubled last year , " she said .
" children 's souls and bodies are being torn apart by brutal rapes . " one out of three children is under the age of three , said the minister . change to media law may be necessary von der leyen , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said her plans require a change to german media law , but noted that all of germany 's political parties are in favor of doing so . internet providers in scandinavian countries , in italy and in britain already effectively block child pornography sites to a large extent . according to german criminal statistics , the number of cases of purchase and circulation of child pornography increased by 55 percent last year to more than 11,000 ; acquisition via the internet doubled . this year , police investigated more than 12,000 suspected child pornography users , confiscated 2,700 video cassettes , 17,000 cds and dvds , and 250 computers and hard disks . the german child support organization deutsche kinderhilfe welcomed von der leyen 's announcement as a step in the right direction , but urged harsher fines for viewers of child pornography . downloading commercial films is punishable with up to three years in prison , the organization says , while downloading sites with child pornography is punishable with up to two years . dw staff -lrb- db -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger concurred .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy .

" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states .

" now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations .

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .

" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .

iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .

barroso said the financial panacea would not be a one-size-fits-all solution , but would use all flexibility available under eu budget rules .

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
germany 's own package comprises 20 billion euros , comprised mainly of cuts to payroll levies decided in october and 12 billion euros , mainly in tax rebates for new-car buyers and soft loans , decided nov .

" what we need is a coordinated european union response , big enough , bold enough to work in the short term , yet strategic and sustainable enough to turn the crisis into an opportunity in the longer term , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said thursday .
" the plan will be a timely , targeted and temporary fiscal impulse . "
barroso said the financial panacea would not be a one-size-fits-all solution , but would use all flexibility available under eu budget rules .

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .
20 by news that cash-strapped iceland 's nordic neighbors had approved a $ 2.5-billion loan , supplementing the imf loan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's pm geir haarde has generous neighbors " within the framework of the imf-supported program , the nordic countries - denmark , finland , norway and sweden - have worked closely together and jointly decided to supplement the imf financing of 2.1 billion dollars with additional loans of 2.5 billion dollars , " the joint ministerial statement said .
" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the krona .
the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the imf said in a statement .
latvia ready for talks with eu , imf over aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president valdis zatlers wants imf aid for latvia after iceland received the green light from the imf , latvia said that it was to launch formal talks with the eu and imf on financial aid to cushion the baltic nation from its deepening economic crisis prime minister ivars godmanis said the goal of talking to the european commission and the international monetary fund would be to " stabilize the financial system " but declined to say when official negotiations could kick off . he added that " processes connected with a certain bank " would be included in the negotiations but did not elaborate . latvia , which broke free from the crumbling soviet union in 1991 , has enjoyed a reputation as an economic " tiger , " notably since joining the eu . but after several years of double-digit growth , the country of 2.3 million people is now grappling with a recession as its once-robust domestic demand slumps in the face of high inflation , tighter domestic credit rules and the global economic crisis . the latvian economy shrank by 4.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2007 , and official data show the country is suffering the sharpest recession in the eu . for the full year , the latvian central bank expects the economy to shrink by 1.5-1.7 percent and by 3.5-3.9 percent in 2009 .
iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .
" we will be back in 2010 . "
haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .
9 .
" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .
20 by news that cash-strapped iceland 's nordic neighbors had approved a $ 2.5-billion loan , supplementing the imf loan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's pm geir haarde has generous neighbors " within the framework of the imf-supported program , the nordic countries - denmark , finland , norway and sweden - have worked closely together and jointly decided to supplement the imf financing of 2.1 billion dollars with additional loans of 2.5 billion dollars , " the joint ministerial statement said .
" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the krona .
the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the imf said in a statement .
latvia ready for talks with eu , imf over aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president valdis zatlers wants imf aid for latvia after iceland received the green light from the imf , latvia said that it was to launch formal talks with the eu and imf on financial aid to cushion the baltic nation from its deepening economic crisis prime minister ivars godmanis said the goal of talking to the european commission and the international monetary fund would be to " stabilize the financial system " but declined to say when official negotiations could kick off . he added that " processes connected with a certain bank " would be included in the negotiations but did not elaborate . latvia , which broke free from the crumbling soviet union in 1991 , has enjoyed a reputation as an economic " tiger , " notably since joining the eu . but after several years of double-digit growth , the country of 2.3 million people is now grappling with a recession as its once-robust domestic demand slumps in the face of high inflation , tighter domestic credit rules and the global economic crisis . the latvian economy shrank by 4.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2007 , and official data show the country is suffering the sharpest recession in the eu . for the full year , the latvian central bank expects the economy to shrink by 1.5-1.7 percent and by 3.5-3.9 percent in 2009 .
iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .

haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .
9 .
" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .
the three biggest banks were nationalized in early october , and the debacle could cost up to an estimated 85 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 20.11.2008 experimental germany fall to england reserves in berlin friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalscorers john terry and matthew upson celebrate the 2-1 win in berlin england captain john terry helped gift an experimental germany team a comical equalizer and then scored the winner as an england second-string kept up their team 's run of fine form with a 2-1 friendly victory in berlin . the logic of playing international friendlies during the rough-and-tumble of domestic league seasons is often questioned by those who see these extra burdens on players ' stamina and fitness as meaningless , even dangerous , fixtures .
but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger concurred .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said india is an important partner in solving the challenges of the 21st century . the time had come to expand beyond the forum of the group of eight industrialized nations and find " new formats " to deal with international issues , steinmeier said thursday , nov .
20 . india 's participation at the world financial summit in washington was an important step toward shifting the balance of international policy , he added . steinmeier , who was beginning his three-day visit to india , was to hold political discussions later thursday with opposition leader lk advani before meeting with indian prime minister manmohan singh and external affairs minister pranab mukherjee . the leaders planned to discuss responses to the global financial crisis , which the world had to face with international cooperation , steinmeier said , he and the indian leaders were also to discuss ways to deal with climate change as well as the security situations in pakistan and afghanistan and iran 's disputed nuclear program . steinmeier calls for more pressure on iran earlier in the day , steinmeier said the international community should keep up pressure on iran to be transparent about its nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is keen to increase the pressure on iran " iran is stalling at the moment in the expectation that the new american government will send a new signal , " steinmeier said in new delhi .

20 .
so far , group negotiations have taken place between iran and the us , germany , china , russia , britain and france . " nothing changes the fact that iran must move on this issue , " steinmeier said the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , an arm of the united nations , has not held talks in over two months with iranian delegates on any potential military application of the country 's nuclear program .

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .

the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said .

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "

we had a really bad day today .

the munich-based ifo institute said global economic confidence fell in this year 's fourth quarter to 60 points from 73.4 points in the third quarter .
" altogether the data points to a global recession , " the institute said releasing the report , adding that expectations for the coming six months have worsened further .
" the cooling off in the ... world economic climate has this time affected not only the major economic regions of north america , western europe and asia but also central and eastern europe , russia , latin america and australia , " ifo said as the fallout from the financial crisis spreads around the world .

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger concurred .

two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .

the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program .

" we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .

the decision was a harsh blow to the german electronic band kraftwerk . electronic pioneers kraftwerk had successfully sued german rap producer moses pelham for using a two-second sample from their 1977 track " metal on metal " in the rhythm sequence in the song " nur mir " by sabrina setlur that appeared in 1997 .
the case was heard and upheld by a hamburg state court which ruled in kraftwerk 's favor , saying pelham was guilty as reusing even the shortest bit of a song infringed on copyright .

the new court ruling , however , forbids sampling of a song melody and insists that the sample must be part of a completely new musical work bearing no resemblance to the original . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision was a harsh blow to the german electronic band kraftwerk . electronic pioneers kraftwerk had successfully sued german rap producer moses pelham for using a two-second sample from their 1977 track " metal on metal " in the rhythm sequence in the song " nur mir " by sabrina setlur that appeared in 1997 .

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
germany 's own package comprises 20 billion euros , comprised mainly of cuts to payroll levies decided in october and 12 billion euros , mainly in tax rebates for new-car buyers and soft loans , decided nov .

' flexible ' stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso insists tight coordination among eu member states is a no-brainer in brussels , the commission declined to comment on the size of the eu stimulus package , despite german economy minister michael glos commenting wednesday that the deal would be worth around 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- .
" what we need is a coordinated european union response , big enough , bold enough to work in the short term , yet strategic and sustainable enough to turn the crisis into an opportunity in the longer term , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said thursday .

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
germany 's own package comprises 20 billion euros , comprised mainly of cuts to payroll levies decided in october and 12 billion euros , mainly in tax rebates for new-car buyers and soft loans , decided nov .

' flexible ' stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso insists tight coordination among eu member states is a no-brainer in brussels , the commission declined to comment on the size of the eu stimulus package , despite german economy minister michael glos commenting wednesday that the deal would be worth around 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- .
" what we need is a coordinated european union response , big enough , bold enough to work in the short term , yet strategic and sustainable enough to turn the crisis into an opportunity in the longer term , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said thursday .

briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger concurred .
" england played tactically well and we simply were n't good enough . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .

the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .

" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .

iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's pm geir haarde has generous neighbors " within the framework of the imf-supported program , the nordic countries - denmark , finland , norway and sweden - have worked closely together and jointly decided to supplement the imf financing of 2.1 billion dollars with additional loans of 2.5 billion dollars , " the joint ministerial statement said .
" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the krona .
the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the imf said in a statement .
latvia ready for talks with eu , imf over aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president valdis zatlers wants imf aid for latvia after iceland received the green light from the imf , latvia said that it was to launch formal talks with the eu and imf on financial aid to cushion the baltic nation from its deepening economic crisis prime minister ivars godmanis said the goal of talking to the european commission and the international monetary fund would be to " stabilize the financial system " but declined to say when official negotiations could kick off . he added that " processes connected with a certain bank " would be included in the negotiations but did not elaborate . latvia , which broke free from the crumbling soviet union in 1991 , has enjoyed a reputation as an economic " tiger , " notably since joining the eu . but after several years of double-digit growth , the country of 2.3 million people is now grappling with a recession as its once-robust domestic demand slumps in the face of high inflation , tighter domestic credit rules and the global economic crisis . the latvian economy shrank by 4.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2007 , and official data show the country is suffering the sharpest recession in the eu . for the full year , the latvian central bank expects the economy to shrink by 1.5-1.7 percent and by 3.5-3.9 percent in 2009 .

haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .
9 .
" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .
the three biggest banks were nationalized in early october , and the debacle could cost up to an estimated 85 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
germany 's own package comprises 20 billion euros , comprised mainly of cuts to payroll levies decided in october and 12 billion euros , mainly in tax rebates for new-car buyers and soft loans , decided nov .

' flexible ' stimulus package bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso insists tight coordination among eu member states is a no-brainer in brussels , the commission declined to comment on the size of the eu stimulus package , despite german economy minister michael glos commenting wednesday that the deal would be worth around 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 164 billion -rrb- .
" what we need is a coordinated european union response , big enough , bold enough to work in the short term , yet strategic and sustainable enough to turn the crisis into an opportunity in the longer term , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said thursday .
" the plan will be a timely , targeted and temporary fiscal impulse . "
barroso said the financial panacea would not be a one-size-fits-all solution , but would use all flexibility available under eu budget rules .
" everybody suffers from the crisis and everybody needs treatment , but not everyone needs the same pill , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .

for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.11.2008 new study reveals what makes europeans happy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danes and finns are europe 's happiest people , according to the survey wealth does not automatically make people in europe happier , according to a quality-of-life survey conducted in all 27 european union member states .
but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de brussels : eu states should let in workers from new members eu governments should lift their restrictions on workers from the bloc 's newer member states , since they bring more gain than pain , employment commissioner vladimir spidla said tuesday .
-lrb- 18.11.2008 -rrb- brussels calls for boost to food aid for eu poor the european union 's executive body called for a massive boost to the food aid the bloc gives its poorest inhabitants , warning that soaring food prices meant that the current system is no longer sufficient .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said .

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's pm geir haarde has generous neighbors " within the framework of the imf-supported program , the nordic countries - denmark , finland , norway and sweden - have worked closely together and jointly decided to supplement the imf financing of 2.1 billion dollars with additional loans of 2.5 billion dollars , " the joint ministerial statement said .
" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .

iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .

haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .
9 .
" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy .

" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states .

" now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said . " joining with its european partners and multilateral institutions , germany can help these countries withstand today 's financial and economic storms , " said zoellick . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .
germany 's own package comprises 20 billion euros , comprised mainly of cuts to payroll levies decided in october and 12 billion euros , mainly in tax rebates for new-car buyers and soft loans , decided nov .

" what we need is a coordinated european union response , big enough , bold enough to work in the short term , yet strategic and sustainable enough to turn the crisis into an opportunity in the longer term , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said thursday .
" the plan will be a timely , targeted and temporary fiscal impulse . "
barroso said the financial panacea would not be a one-size-fits-all solution , but would use all flexibility available under eu budget rules .

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .

" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .

iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .

haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .

" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .

" one out of three children is under the age of three , said the minister . change to media law may be necessary von der leyen , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said her plans require a change to german media law , but noted that all of germany 's political parties are in favor of doing so . internet providers in scandinavian countries , in italy and in britain already effectively block child pornography sites to a large extent . according to german criminal statistics , the number of cases of purchase and circulation of child pornography increased by 55 percent last year to more than 11,000 ; acquisition via the internet doubled . this year , police investigated more than 12,000 suspected child pornography users , confiscated 2,700 video cassettes , 17,000 cds and dvds , and 250 computers and hard disks . the german child support organization deutsche kinderhilfe welcomed von der leyen 's announcement as a step in the right direction , but urged harsher fines for viewers of child pornography . downloading commercial films is punishable with up to three years in prison , the organization says , while downloading sites with child pornography is punishable with up to two years . dw staff -lrb- db -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 20.11.2008 experimental germany fall to england reserves in berlin friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalscorers john terry and matthew upson celebrate the 2-1 win in berlin england captain john terry helped gift an experimental germany team a comical equalizer and then scored the winner as an england second-string kept up their team 's run of fine form with a 2-1 friendly victory in berlin . the logic of playing international friendlies during the rough-and-tumble of domestic league seasons is often questioned by those who see these extra burdens on players ' stamina and fitness as meaningless , even dangerous , fixtures .
but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's pm geir haarde has generous neighbors " within the framework of the imf-supported program , the nordic countries - denmark , finland , norway and sweden - have worked closely together and jointly decided to supplement the imf financing of 2.1 billion dollars with additional loans of 2.5 billion dollars , " the joint ministerial statement said .
" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the krona .
the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the imf said in a statement .
latvia ready for talks with eu , imf over aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president valdis zatlers wants imf aid for latvia after iceland received the green light from the imf , latvia said that it was to launch formal talks with the eu and imf on financial aid to cushion the baltic nation from its deepening economic crisis prime minister ivars godmanis said the goal of talking to the european commission and the international monetary fund would be to " stabilize the financial system " but declined to say when official negotiations could kick off . he added that " processes connected with a certain bank " would be included in the negotiations but did not elaborate . latvia , which broke free from the crumbling soviet union in 1991 , has enjoyed a reputation as an economic " tiger , " notably since joining the eu . but after several years of double-digit growth , the country of 2.3 million people is now grappling with a recession as its once-robust domestic demand slumps in the face of high inflation , tighter domestic credit rules and the global economic crisis . the latvian economy shrank by 4.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2007 , and official data show the country is suffering the sharpest recession in the eu . for the full year , the latvian central bank expects the economy to shrink by 1.5-1.7 percent and by 3.5-3.9 percent in 2009 .
iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .
" we will be back in 2010 . "
haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .

" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .

eu officials are drawing up the plan to be unveiled by the european commission next wednesday and submitted to eu leaders next month .
briefing papers show the eu is to request all 27 member states to donate 1 percent of gross domestic product to revive weak demand .
deal not good for germany but wilhelm told reporters germany would be disadvantaged if made to kick in more funds on top of money it has already pumped into the economy .
" nations that have already acted in recent weeks should not be punished for it , while those who have done nothing end up better off . "
he said that the fiscal stimulus approved so far , to be paid for by germany 's municipal , state and federal governments , was pumping 1.3 percent of gdp into the economy .
the briefing document on the eu fiscal stimulus proposals was obtained by german news agency dpa from government sources .
the money is to be focussed on the hardest-hit sectors such as automobile manufacturing and construction .

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's pm geir haarde has generous neighbors " within the framework of the imf-supported program , the nordic countries - denmark , finland , norway and sweden - have worked closely together and jointly decided to supplement the imf financing of 2.1 billion dollars with additional loans of 2.5 billion dollars , " the joint ministerial statement said .
" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the krona .
the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the imf said in a statement .
latvia ready for talks with eu , imf over aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president valdis zatlers wants imf aid for latvia after iceland received the green light from the imf , latvia said that it was to launch formal talks with the eu and imf on financial aid to cushion the baltic nation from its deepening economic crisis prime minister ivars godmanis said the goal of talking to the european commission and the international monetary fund would be to " stabilize the financial system " but declined to say when official negotiations could kick off . he added that " processes connected with a certain bank " would be included in the negotiations but did not elaborate . latvia , which broke free from the crumbling soviet union in 1991 , has enjoyed a reputation as an economic " tiger , " notably since joining the eu . but after several years of double-digit growth , the country of 2.3 million people is now grappling with a recession as its once-robust domestic demand slumps in the face of high inflation , tighter domestic credit rules and the global economic crisis . the latvian economy shrank by 4.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2007 , and official data show the country is suffering the sharpest recession in the eu . for the full year , the latvian central bank expects the economy to shrink by 1.5-1.7 percent and by 3.5-3.9 percent in 2009 .
iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .

haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .
9 .
" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .
the compensation agreed for the british and dutch depositors was 20,000 euros .
haarde has said iceland needs some $ 6 billion , and recently warned the economy would contract some 10 percent next year .
the icelandic economy , which is highly dependent on the country 's financial system , was knocked flat by the international crisis .

two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .

" not offering georgia a plan of action leading to membership will send the wrong signal to the wrong people , " he said .
russia has strongly opposed georgia being absorbed into nato , insisting that the former soviet republic is within its sphere of influence .
timetables , or membership action plans , offer new entrants a transition period to reshape their military institutions to nato standards .
both georgia and ukraine are believed to be on the cusp of receiving maps .
russia still ' occupying ' georgia saakashvili met thursday with the premier of bavaria , horst seehofer , and opened an honorary georgian consulate in munich .
he took the opportunity to criticize russia , saying it was preventing half a million georgians from returning to their homes in two breakaway territories - south ossetia and abkhazia - which russia has recognized as independent states .
he added that russian troops were still occupying one fifth of georgian territory .
the georgian president also said that " georgia belongs to europe " and had a european history and european hopes .
he also shared his hopes his country would obtain a partnership and association agreement with the european union , despite also insisting tbilisi still sought better relations with russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.11.2008 new study reveals what makes europeans happy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danes and finns are europe 's happiest people , according to the survey wealth does not automatically make people in europe happier , according to a quality-of-life survey conducted in all 27 european union member states .
but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" not offering georgia a plan of action leading to membership will send the wrong signal to the wrong people , " he said .
russia has strongly opposed georgia being absorbed into nato , insisting that the former soviet republic is within its sphere of influence .
timetables , or membership action plans , offer new entrants a transition period to reshape their military institutions to nato standards .
both georgia and ukraine are believed to be on the cusp of receiving maps .
russia still ' occupying ' georgia saakashvili met thursday with the premier of bavaria , horst seehofer , and opened an honorary georgian consulate in munich .
he took the opportunity to criticize russia , saying it was preventing half a million georgians from returning to their homes in two breakaway territories - south ossetia and abkhazia - which russia has recognized as independent states .
he added that russian troops were still occupying one fifth of georgian territory .
the georgian president also said that " georgia belongs to europe " and had a european history and european hopes .
he also shared his hopes his country would obtain a partnership and association agreement with the european union , despite also insisting tbilisi still sought better relations with russia .

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .
nordic nations do the neighborly thing the announcement was followed on thursday , nov .
20 by news that cash-strapped iceland 's nordic neighbors had approved a $ 2.5-billion loan , supplementing the imf loan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's pm geir haarde has generous neighbors " within the framework of the imf-supported program , the nordic countries - denmark , finland , norway and sweden - have worked closely together and jointly decided to supplement the imf financing of 2.1 billion dollars with additional loans of 2.5 billion dollars , " the joint ministerial statement said .
" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the krona .
the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the imf said in a statement .
latvia ready for talks with eu , imf over aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president valdis zatlers wants imf aid for latvia after iceland received the green light from the imf , latvia said that it was to launch formal talks with the eu and imf on financial aid to cushion the baltic nation from its deepening economic crisis prime minister ivars godmanis said the goal of talking to the european commission and the international monetary fund would be to " stabilize the financial system " but declined to say when official negotiations could kick off . he added that " processes connected with a certain bank " would be included in the negotiations but did not elaborate . latvia , which broke free from the crumbling soviet union in 1991 , has enjoyed a reputation as an economic " tiger , " notably since joining the eu . but after several years of double-digit growth , the country of 2.3 million people is now grappling with a recession as its once-robust domestic demand slumps in the face of high inflation , tighter domestic credit rules and the global economic crisis . the latvian economy shrank by 4.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2007 , and official data show the country is suffering the sharpest recession in the eu . for the full year , the latvian central bank expects the economy to shrink by 1.5-1.7 percent and by 3.5-3.9 percent in 2009 .
iceland 's pm promises recovery , compensation iceland 's prime minister geir haarde said on tuesday that , despite his country being battered by the international financial crisis , iceland will be back on its feet in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing 's german clients will be compensated " with help from the international monetary fund , we will be able to quickly put this difficult period behind us , " haarde told the german business daily handelsblatt .
" we will be back in 2010 . "
haarde also used the interview to reassure 30,000 german clients of the kaupthing bank , where accounts were frozen on oct .
9 .
" they should worry less than a few weeks ago , " he said .
a german finance ministry spokesman said german account holders should recuperate up to 20,900 euros each .
kaupthing , one of iceland 's three main banking groups , recently collapsed over the global credit crunch .
iceland also said it had agreed to reimburse british and dutch depositors of failed internet bank icesave , operated by the collapsed landsbanki bank .

two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .

in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .

" relations with russia have been strained in recent years , " zoellick told an audience at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , nov .
19 . " today 's financial crisis could be an opportunity to develop sounder economic relations that might be a foundation , with russia 's help , to build co-operation in solving common problems , " said zoellick . the world bank chief also stepped up his call for the international community to take action to recognize the growing economic power of the world 's leading emerging economies such as russia and china . zoellick 's remarks echoed comments made over the weekend by russian president dmitry medvedev .
he said working together with the united states to resolve the economic crisis was an opportunity for the two countries to rebuild relations . this in particular follows the tensions unleashed between washington and moscow over us plans to deploy missiles in central europe and the conflict in georgia . " the financial crisis is the common enemy of the us and russia , " medvedev told a gathering at the council on foreign relations think tank in washington after attending the summit of group of 20 leaders in the us capital . the g20 took a major step at its summit in washington towards boosting the role of emerging economies in key global forums such as the international monetary fund and paving the way for regular meetings of g20 leaders . russia can be part of the solution to crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick called the financial crisis a " common enemy " in his speech in berlin , zoellick also stressed again how inadequate forums such as the group of seven leading industrial nations were in facing up to the changes underway in the world economy . " as the financial crisis has shown , we need more than the group of seven to address today 's 21st century problems , " he said .
" rising economic powers such as china , india and russia must be part of the solution . " we now need reinvented global frameworks to reach our potential , to weather storms of economic changes or climate security , " he added . delivering his speech , zoellick paid tribute to former german chancellor willy brandt 's vision in international affairs and his efforts as german chancellor between 1969 and 1974 to end germany 's cold war divide . in addition to stressing the importance of germany 's ties with western democracies , zoellick said brandt " was alert to the sensitivities of germany 's smaller eastern states . " zoellick : germany can be a leading light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's germany can help new democracies , zoellick said with this in mind , zoellick called on berlin to play an active role in helping the new democracies in central europe that emerged from the collapse of communism nearly 20 years to find their way through the current financial crisis . " now some of germany 's newer european union neighbors face financial and economic dangers , " the world bank chief said .
" they are caught up in an economic whirlwind . " i hope germany will work with other eu members to be supportive of those neighbors , " zoellick added . germany 's post-second world war economic transformation helped to lay the foundations for the nation to emerge as europe 's biggest economy . but the world bank president reminded his audience , " you know better than others how economic travails can spark political embers , flaming into social conflagrations . " the german and european horizons should also be extended to the challenges taking shape in ukraine , moldova and the caucasus , zoellick said .

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fund said it approved the stand-by arrangement - structured so that iceland can immediately draw about $ 827 million , with the rest in eight installments of about $ 155 million - to stabilize a " banking crisis of extraordinary proportions . "
the global financial crisis sparked the collapse of three of iceland 's major banks and a rapid depreciation of the crown and the nation is facing a severe recession through 2010 , the fund said in a statement .
the imf forecast that iceland 's economy would be badly damaged , with real gross domestic product falling 9.6 per centnext year after an expected 1.6 percent advance in 2008 .
it estimated that the unemployment rate would quadruple to 5.7 percent next year .
however , once confidence is restored and balance sheets readjusted , the imf predicts domestic demand to rebound strongly in 2011 .
" iceland 's long-term growth prospects remain favorable , buttressed by its very strong fundamentals of a highly educated labor force , a favorable investment climate , and a rich natural resource endowment , " said john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , in a statement .

" we stress that , as outlined in the imf program , an ambitious multi-year fiscal consolidation program will help iceland stabilize the economy , including the exchange rate , and reduce public debt over the medium-term , " the statement added .
the finance ministers said " implementing the imf program will not be easy , " but they believed it could help rebalance iceland 's economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.11.2008 eu ministers strike deal on farm aid reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is driving farm policy away from subsidies to environmental development after marathon negotiations , the eu 's agricultural ministers hammered out a series of reforms to europe 's expensive policy of agricultural subsidies . european union agricultural ministers struck a deal on thursday , nov .
20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , marking europe 's most significant reform of farm support policy since 2003 .
two of the central decisions dealt with cutting subsidies and systematically raising milk quotas for before production limits expire in 2015 . the 27 eu agriculture ministers began their meeting on wednesday afternoon and emerged the next morning with a compromise .
the revised measures will take effect in 2009 and run till 2013 . europe 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- has a budget of 53 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- , more than 40 percent of the eu budget .
launched in 1962 to reduce europe 's reliance on food imports , europe 's agricultural subsidy system soon led to surplus production , infamously known as beef , butter and grain mountains and lakes of excess wine . legacy of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers are worried prices will drop as production quotas rise milk quotas have been in place since 1984 to limit production , but increased foreign demand have since made them superfluous .
the quotas are due to be scrapped in 2015 and after this most recent reform will be progressively raised until then . discontent has been stirred recently by revelations about wealthy landowners and large agri-businesses cashing in the handouts intended to keep struggling farmers afloat in the face of globalization . critics have demanded that the eu address inequalities within its farm subsidy program . " we 've known for a while now that roughly 80 percent of the cap goes to the richest 20 percent of farmers , " jack thurston , co-founder of farmsubsidy.org , told the independent .
" those who benefit from subsidies the most have never been the poor struggling farmer . " the eu is now incrementally trying to address such problems while at the same time preparing farmers for a more subsidy-free , liberalized market . " we want a soft landing before the expiry of the quota system , " said eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel in an interview with the german dpa news agency ahead of the ministers ' meeting .
" if you sit on your hands and wait until 2015 , then i think you would definitely put farmers in a very awkward and difficult situation , because then you would see that their quotas would be gone overnight and that they had no possibility to adjust to a new situation . " compromise and concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel had a tiring night of talks before reaching a compromise while the issue of how to support dairy farmers proved to be the most difficult , after the talks fischer boel said she was confident the eu would be " fit for the future . " germany and other countries had been against increased quotas because they would reduce the price of milk .
countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

countries like italy , on the other hand , wanted a quota increase because it needs more milk to produce its wide variety of cheeses and other dairy delicacies . according to the ministers ' agreement , the quotas will generally be raised by 1 percent for five years starting in 2009 .
in a one-time move , however , italy will be allowed to raise its quota by 5 percent next year .
if necessary , ministers agreed to revisit the issue in 2010 and 2011 " to take appropriate adjustment measures , " said french agriculture minister michel barnier . " everyone had to deliver sacrifices … .but every member state can go back and say they achieved something , " said fischer boel .
for example , germany will be allowed to spend some of its rural development money to support its milk sector . german agriculture minister ilse aigner welcomed thursday 's deal . " for me , the health check was all in all a success , even if not all our wishes came true . "
aigner said , adding that by reviewing the market situation in 2010 and 2012 , quotas could be adjusted if there were any serious distortions . diverting aid to the environment the eu ministers also agreed to shift subsidies from agricultural production to nature protection and rural revitalization schemes . brussels has already mandated that 5 percent of eu farm money be redirected to such countryside preservation measures and wanted to raise the amount to 13 percent by 2013 .
the farm ministers , however , agreed to limit the cut in farm subsidies for diversion to environmental preservation to a total of 10 percent . dw staff -lrb- dsf -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "

but for the coaches of germany and england on wednesday night , this match was a chance to get a better idea of what future their teams may have .
the difference between the two coaches , however , was that , for the most part , germany 's joachim loew was blooding new players through design while england 's fabio capello was forced to do the same by default .
loew brought in schalke midfielder jermaine jones for his first start while uncapped defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis were rewarded for their roles in lifting hoffenheim to the higher reaches of the bundesliga .
wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer was promoted to the squad .
loew partnered jones with leverkusen captain simon rolfes in the central roles usually operated in by michael ballack and torsten frings .
ballack would have played had it not been that he was still recovering from foot surgery , while frings had been left out to give younger players a chance .
england 's hand was a little more forced .
capello came to berlin without a complete outfield of first teamers .
steven gerrard , wayne rooney , frank lampard , rio ferdinand and theo walcott were among the injured while there was no place for michael owen and david beckham despite the depleted nature of the team .
with both sides full of young players and new faces , it was unsurprising that many wanted to impress their coaches and the game at the olympic stadium got off to a blistering start with england on the offensive .
young , hungry england look to impress the experimental offensive partnership of gabriel agonblahor and jermaine defoe , aided by the flying wingers stewart downing and shaun wright-phillips , gave england pace and width in attack and germany 's newcomers were overwhelmed in the opening stages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a missed corner , defender upson poked home england 's pressure paid off in the 24th minute when defender matthew upson capitalized on a blunder by germany keeper rene adler to poke home the missed cross through a mass of bodies .
hoffenheim defender compper looked unhappy on his first cap on the left of defense and germany continued to struggle to find any sort of fluid movement without the absent captain ballack and the overlooked frings .
jones and rolfes in the centre of midfield were often second best in an area of the park patrolled simply and effectively by michael carrick and gareth barry .
the first half ended with jeers from home fans , and loew reacted by replacing the quiet miroslav klose with leverkusen 's in-form striker patrick helmes and borussia moenchengladbach 's marko marin came on for jones , while the appearance of lukas podolski up front in the 57th minute put the woefully ineffective mario gomez out of his misery .
tim wiese took over from adler in goal to earn his first cap , while capello also rang the changes at half-time , bringing on tottenham 's darren bent for defoe and keeper scott carson for david james .
keeper calamity breathes life into germany england could have been two goals ahead in the 63rd minute when bent had the chance of the match when he was put through a static german defense by a sublime gareth barry pass but as he rounded wiese he lost his footing and screwed the ball wide of an empty goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carson and terry were dumbfounded as helmes scored carson 's first game for england after his blunder against croatia a year ago contributed to england 's failure to qualify for euro 2008 , turned sour just seconds after bent 's miss when he hesitated to clear a harmless ball as john terry tried to shield it from the predatory helmes .
with neither england player getting to the ball in time , helmes nipped in , put the ball through carson 's legs and rolled it into the empty net .
the goal gave germany fresh confidence and the home side enjoyed a brief spell of ascendency , with marin testing carson with a long-range effort which the england keeper could only parry away .
terry makes amends with winning header bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flying terry kept england 's berlin record intact but england were soon back on the front foot and the lively wright-phillips struck the post before captain john terry made amends for his role in the comical german equalizer by meeting a stewart downing free-kick with a well-directed header six minutes from time .
germany claimed terry had infringed his marker heiko westermann to get to the ball but the appeals were half-hearted at best .
despite a history of beating england when it really matters , germany found themselves stuck with a record of never having beaten england at berlin in eight encounters when the final whistle blew .
capello happy with second-string 's performance england coach capello was rightly pleased with his side 's performance , which came after a perfect four-game winning start to the world cup qualifying campaign , but said the victory by a virtual reserve side sent " no message " to his absent first-choice players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's england kept up its current good form " i said right from the start the players had to recover their confidence and i think the players understand that .
you can see that in the game and in training , " he said .
" the result is important but the performance is very , very good because we played here in berlin against germany , a good team .
" we played very well , had a lot of chances to score goals and i liked the attitude of the team .
we played with confidence , which is very , very important , and with personality , " capello added .
" they -lrb- the absent players -rrb- will all be very happy because we won here , " the england coach said , adding that he had confidence in his team .
" we had the opportunity to know some players better who have not played many games for me .
now , after the game , i know a lot of players better , " he said .
" i do n't like to speak about one player , always i speak about the team , but all the players played well .
it 's very important the spirit we play every game . "
germans magnanimous in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew admitted that germany were second best germany coach joachim loew said : " england were the better side throughout the game .
we had a really bad day today .
in the second half we made some inroads into the game but on the whole you can say we deserved to lose . "
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger concurred .
" england played tactically well and we simply were n't good enough . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she says it is up to internet firms to pull the plug " immediately " on child pornography . the federal crime office is compiling a list of web sites that post images of children being sexually abused , von der leyen said .
currently , pictures of tortured children are downloaded from the internet about 50,000 times per month . " i want to build a dam against the flood of pictures by blocking access for the users , " von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , said in the interview published thursday , nov .
20 , in hamburger abendblatt . she added that the amount of child pornography on the web is spiraling out of control . " the numbers are exploding - the distribution of such pictures doubled last year , " she said .
" children 's souls and bodies are being torn apart by brutal rapes . " one out of three children is under the age of three , said the minister . change to media law may be necessary von der leyen , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , said her plans require a change to german media law , but noted that all of germany 's political parties are in favor of doing so . internet providers in scandinavian countries , in italy and in britain already effectively block child pornography sites to a large extent . according to german criminal statistics , the number of cases of purchase and circulation of child pornography increased by 55 percent last year to more than 11,000 ; acquisition via the internet doubled . this year , police investigated more than 12,000 suspected child pornography users , confiscated 2,700 video cassettes , 17,000 cds and dvds , and 250 computers and hard disks . the german child support organization deutsche kinderhilfe welcomed von der leyen 's announcement as a step in the right direction , but urged harsher fines for viewers of child pornography . downloading commercial films is punishable with up to three years in prison , the organization says , while downloading sites with child pornography is punishable with up to two years . dw staff -lrb- db -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" not offering georgia a plan of action leading to membership will send the wrong signal to the wrong people , " he said .

but it certainly plays an important role . the study , released on wednesday , nov .
19 shows that other factors , such as social environment and health , also contribute greatly to levels of satisfaction . the happiest europeans are the danes and finns , according to the findings of a representative survey of 30,000 eu citizens .
at the other end of the scale , hungary and bulgaria returned the lowest satisfaction rates . germans , czechs and slovaks lie at what might be called the happy medium , while the french , british and spanish reported above-average satisfaction with their lot in life .
in poland , austria and especially in italy , people had more to grumble about . " countries with high incomes do very well in terms of satisfaction in life , " said branislav mikulic of the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions -lrb- eurofound -rrb- . money isn ’ t everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at some point , money becomes irrelevant however , happiness and satisfaction did n't rise in line with the bank balance . " once a certain level of happiness has been reached , money no longer plays a great role in improving quality of life , " he said . as an example , mikulic cited the nordic countries , where people on different income levels reported similar levels of happiness . the danes , finns , swedes and dutch , all of whom scored at the top of the happiness index , considered tensions between rich and poor to be negligible in their respective countries .
in germany , france , poland and austria , the gap between rich and poor was more keenly felt . real problems in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eastern europeans do n't have enough to afford a warm meal every day in the countries which joined the eu after 2004 , fewer people can afford even the simple things in life .
in most of the new eu states , more than 15 percent of respondents said they had too little money to heat their home or eat a warm meal with fish or meat every other day .
poorer people also faced a tougher family life . the survey reveals that many eu citizens feel ill . " not many people in the eu judge their state of health as good , " said robert anderson , of the research team .
this is crucial , since family and health are considered the greatest factors for happiness . upbeat germans life quality is generally rated higher within the private sphere than the social context .
many europeans complain about air pollution and noise , ethnic tensions or criminality . despite all the problems cited , most participants in the survey , conducted between september 2007 and february 2008 , were optimistic about the future .
germans were exceptionally positive , while hungary was the only country dominated by pessimists . in march the eu foundation plans to release a full evaluation of the survey , comparing the data to the initial study undertaken in 2003 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a military spokesman said 50 rebels and about 10 soldiers had been killed during several days of heavy fighting .
the sri lankan army overran a five-mile -lrb- 8km -rrb- embankment dotted with fortified bunkers , he said .
the rebels are said to have three more defensive lines on the land dividing their territory from the government 's .
government forces are seeking to crush the tigers and end their fight for a separate state for the ethnic tamil minority .
in recent months the rebels have been driven from many towns and villages along the coast in the north-west .
sri lankan security forces are also close to the rebels ' administrative headquarters in the northern town of kilinochchi .
' major offensive ' the first line of tamil tiger defences at muhamalai fell after several days of heavy fighting , sri lanka 's military spokesman brigadier udaya nanayakkara said .
the tigers are believed to have three more defensive lines on the narrow isthmus of land that divides rebel territory from the government-controlled jaffna in the far north , he said .
the tigers have not commented on the military 's claims and the government strictly controls access by journalists to the area where the fighting is taking place .
the bbc 's roland buerk in colombo says sri lanka 's military is on a major offensive against the rebels and troops have been advancing rapidly .
but there is concern over the fate of hundreds of thousands of civilians who have fled their homes and are now trapped in the diminishing rebel territory , our correspondent says .
amnesty international has said the government is incapable of providing for their basic needs , such as shelters , sanitation and safe drinking water .
the human rights organisation has also accused the tigers of not allowing civilians to move to safer places and of using them as a human shield against the military 's onslaught .
earlier this week , sri lankan troops captured a strategically important town used by the tigers as a key supply route to the island 's north , the army said .
it was the first time in recent fighting that the army had captured parts of the a9 highway leading from the centre of the island to the jaffna peninsula , correspondents said .
brig nanayakkara said the army had taken control of mankulam town , near the a9 , on monday .
he said that in capturing the town , in rebel hands since 1999 , the army had cut off rebel supply routes .
on sunday , the army said it had entered the tamil tiger stronghold of pooneryn and now controlled the entire western coast .
the rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for tamils in the north and east since 1983 and about 70,000 people have been killed in the violence .

a military spokesman said 50 rebels and about 10 soldiers had been killed during several days of heavy fighting .
the sri lankan army overran a five-mile -lrb- 8km -rrb- embankment dotted with fortified bunkers , he said .
the rebels are said to have three more defensive lines on the land dividing their territory from the government 's .
government forces are seeking to crush the tigers and end their fight for a separate state for the ethnic tamil minority .
in recent months the rebels have been driven from many towns and villages along the coast in the north-west .
sri lankan security forces are also close to the rebels ' administrative headquarters in the northern town of kilinochchi .
' major offensive ' the first line of tamil tiger defences at muhamalai fell after several days of heavy fighting , sri lanka 's military spokesman brigadier udaya nanayakkara said .
the tigers are believed to have three more defensive lines on the narrow isthmus of land that divides rebel territory from the government-controlled jaffna in the far north , he said .
the tigers have not commented on the military 's claims and the government strictly controls access by journalists to the area where the fighting is taking place .
the bbc 's roland buerk in colombo says sri lanka 's military is on a major offensive against the rebels and troops have been advancing rapidly .
but there is concern over the fate of hundreds of thousands of civilians who have fled their homes and are now trapped in the diminishing rebel territory , our correspondent says .
amnesty international has said the government is incapable of providing for their basic needs , such as shelters , sanitation and safe drinking water .
the human rights organisation has also accused the tigers of not allowing civilians to move to safer places and of using them as a human shield against the military 's onslaught .
earlier this week , sri lankan troops captured a strategically important town used by the tigers as a key supply route to the island 's north , the army said .
it was the first time in recent fighting that the army had captured parts of the a9 highway leading from the centre of the island to the jaffna peninsula , correspondents said .
brig nanayakkara said the army had taken control of mankulam town , near the a9 , on monday .
he said that in capturing the town , in rebel hands since 1999 , the army had cut off rebel supply routes .
on sunday , the army said it had entered the tamil tiger stronghold of pooneryn and now controlled the entire western coast .
the rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for tamils in the north and east since 1983 and about 70,000 people have been killed in the violence .

for weeks judges len , arlene , craig and bruno have waxed lyrical about the skills and finesse of cherie lunghi , lisa snowdon and rachel stevens , but christine has begun her assault on the summit .
after nine weeks of competition , christine remains the only female contestant not to have faced the dreaded dance-off , a signal of her popularity with the voting public .
last saturday , she and her partner matthew cutler , waltzed their way to a personal best score of 34 and 4th place on the leaderboard .
you want to be worthy of their votes christine bleakley " it 's nice at this point , obviously , to still be in the competition .
austin , lisa , cherie and tom have always been up there at the top , so we 've been tip-toeing around it , " said christine .
" and then we just knock-em for six when they least expect it . "
the judges were also knocked for six by christine 's performance .
" without doubt , your best yet , " said arlene phillips .
head judge len goodman said he was surprised by her waltz : " she 's under the radar , and suddenly bloomin , blimey - where did she come from ? "
public support but high scores do not always guarantee your place in the competition .
in the last two weeks three of the bookies ' favourites have found themselves in the bottom two , with early favourite cherie lunghi leaving on saturday .
however , christine has been saved by the public vote every week .
" i can not tell you what it feels like to walk down the street and have a complete stranger come up and say we were really supporting you on saturday , well done , we voted for you , " she said .
" it 's an incredible feeling and it 's just lovely to have the support from people right across the country .
" you want to be worthy of their votes , i want to work harder for that very reason . "
john sergeant announced on wednesday he was leaving the show this weekend christine and matthew will be attempting to master the cha cha cha , a dance that garnered matthew a near perfect 39 points last year with his partner , and eventual winner , alesha dixon .
" i thought the waltz would be a good dance , she picked it up very quickly .
i was really proud , she was so soft and she performed it , " said matthew .
" this week we are going to have to work very hard . "
early exit on wednesday john sergeant pulled out of the competition .
widely seen as the people 's champion , he proved to be a thorn in the side of the judges .
the former bbc political correspondent caused a huge furore each week as the public saved him while other celebrities were relegated to the dance-off .
" it was always my intention to have fun on the show and i was hoping to stay in as long as possible .
the trouble is that there is now a real danger that i might win the competition , " said john .
" even for me that would be a joke too far . "
john and his partner kristina rihanoff will perform a farewell dance on saturday .
strictly come dancing is on bbc one on saturday night at 1820 gmt .

the assembly government report is an attempt to pull together information on all aspects of children 's lives .
ministers hope it will act as a benchmark to help measure improvements .
examining existing data on issues such as education , health and tackling poverty , it covers the lives of welsh children from birth until the age of 18 .
children 's minister jane hutt said : " this is the first time we have published something which paints as comprehensive and reliable a picture of children and young people 's well-being as possible .
as recession looms we are concerned that this may be used as a fig leaf for failure mark isherwood am , conservative " it highlights areas where we are making real progress , as well as the issues which still need our attention . "
in health , it shows an increase in sexually transmitted infections and the high levels of teenage pregnancy in wales compared with other european countries .
it also found that around a fifth of children under 15 in wales are obese .
the number of children placed under care orders by local authorities has increased by around a third in the last decade , according to the report .

colombian prosecutors say the company , dmg , was a front for money-laundering , and has requested the extradition of its main shareholder , david murcia .
he fled to panama when the scheme failed , prompting deadly protests by investors who had lost money .
it is not yet known if panama will extradite him .

dmg had promised investors returns of up to 150 % a month on their deposits .
it was among several finance firms whose sudden closure prompted violent protests in a number of colombian cities , in which at least two people died .

police sealed the offices of most of the 240 pyramid schemes they had tracked down , which between them had collected well over $ 200m , correspondents say .
international arrest warrants were issued for the heads of the pyramid schemes , but many are believed to have fled the country , taking hundreds of millions of dollars with them .
colombia 's president alvaro uribe has vowed to help poor investors recover their money after many of them lost their life savings .
he said police had already seized some $ 40m -lrb- £ 27m -rrb- held by pyramid schemes and that some of the finance companies had begun returning money to investors .
the emergency decrees set out new procedures to intervene in financial firms operating without authority and to seize their funds .
the decrees also aim to ease the return of funds to depositors .
