voigt told supporters the government had failed in 2003 in a law case to ban the npd and was now trying to undermine the group by " drying up " its income .
he said a fine for filing fraudulent accounts had dealt a " serious blow " to the party .
the npd has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies , but has never won seats at federal level because of a rule blocking representation to groups with less than 5 per cent of the national vote .
about 2,000 people attended two anti-npd rallies in bamberg .

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tillich , until now state finance minister , was overwhelmingly elected chairman at a party convention in zwickau with no opponent .
the state assembly in dresden , which appoints the saxon premier , is set to elect milbradt 's successor on wednesday .

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voigt told supporters the government had failed in 2003 in a law case to ban the npd and was now trying to undermine the group by " drying up " its income .
he said a fine for filing fraudulent accounts had dealt a " serious blow " to the party .
the npd has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies , but has never won seats at federal level because of a rule blocking representation to groups with less than 5 per cent of the national vote .
about 2,000 people attended two anti-npd rallies in bamberg .
after lethal clashes between the opponents on may 1 in hamburg , riot police kept a close eye on about 450 militant leftists who marched into bamberg from its railway station to confront the npd .
police detained 19 , but there was no major trouble .
bamberg mayor calls for peaceful protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protestors gather in bamburg mainstream groups attended a " festival for democracy " on bamberg 's main square , where mayor andreas starke said his city had vainly sought by legal means to prevent the npd conference taking place there .
he called for anti-npd protests to be peaceful .
" this party stokes hate and prejudices , it 's racist and anti-semitic .
we , on the other hand , avow ourselves to the values of the constitution , to freedom , tolerance and human rights , " he said .
anti-subversion agencies who monitor the npd estimate its card-carrying membership has grown recently by 1,000 to 7,000 as germany neo-nazis rally to it .
the npd denies that it is neo-nazi .
german law outlaws neo-nazi organizations .
in the northern german port city of kiel , police counted 1,200 demonstrators saturday at an anti-npd rally .
the protesters were alarmed by poll data suggesting the npd would win some seats in the kiel city council in an election on sunday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fraud was facilitated or its detection delayed by the weakness of the supervision of the trader and of the control mechanism of market activities , " the report states . kerviel 's supervisors , " who formed the first level of control , proved to be negligent in the supervision of his activities , " the report went on to say . the auditors also found that kerviel 's direct supervisor had " exhibited an inappropriate tolerance for the taking of -lsb- unauthorized trading -rsb- positions " by kerviel on the market . although the report does not name kerviel 's direct supervisor at societe generale 's delta one trading desk , a report friday in the paris-based international herald tribune identified him as eric cordelle .

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .

eleven of germany 's 16 state premiers belong to the cdu or its csu bavarian sister party .
a catholic leader of the sorb people , germany 's slavic-language minority , tillich is set to take over the eastern german state that has prospered best in two harsh decades since the collapse of german communism wiped out the region 's industry .
saxony has rebuilt around its car and semiconductor industries , but its finances were weakened when a state-guaranteed bank invested in us securities that became nearly worthless in the subprime financial crisis .
tillich , until now state finance minister , was overwhelmingly elected chairman at a party convention in zwickau with no opponent .
the state assembly in dresden , which appoints the saxon premier , is set to elect milbradt 's successor on wednesday .
milbradt said the main reason he was retiring was to usher in a change of generation , but he told a reporter he had also become fed up with carping from the junior partner in his coalition , the social democratic party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voigt told supporters the government had failed in 2003 in a law case to ban the npd and was now trying to undermine the group by " drying up " its income .
he said a fine for filing fraudulent accounts had dealt a " serious blow " to the party .
the npd has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies , but has never won seats at federal level because of a rule blocking representation to groups with less than 5 per cent of the national vote .
about 2,000 people attended two anti-npd rallies in bamberg .
after lethal clashes between the opponents on may 1 in hamburg , riot police kept a close eye on about 450 militant leftists who marched into bamberg from its railway station to confront the npd .
police detained 19 , but there was no major trouble .
bamberg mayor calls for peaceful protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protestors gather in bamburg mainstream groups attended a " festival for democracy " on bamberg 's main square , where mayor andreas starke said his city had vainly sought by legal means to prevent the npd conference taking place there .
he called for anti-npd protests to be peaceful .
" this party stokes hate and prejudices , it 's racist and anti-semitic .
we , on the other hand , avow ourselves to the values of the constitution , to freedom , tolerance and human rights , " he said .
anti-subversion agencies who monitor the npd estimate its card-carrying membership has grown recently by 1,000 to 7,000 as germany neo-nazis rally to it .
the npd denies that it is neo-nazi .
german law outlaws neo-nazi organizations .
in the northern german port city of kiel , police counted 1,200 demonstrators saturday at an anti-npd rally .
the protesters were alarmed by poll data suggesting the npd would win some seats in the kiel city council in an election on sunday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fraud was facilitated or its detection delayed by the weakness of the supervision of the trader and of the control mechanism of market activities , " the report states . kerviel 's supervisors , " who formed the first level of control , proved to be negligent in the supervision of his activities , " the report went on to say . the auditors also found that kerviel 's direct supervisor had " exhibited an inappropriate tolerance for the taking of -lsb- unauthorized trading -rsb- positions " by kerviel on the market . although the report does not name kerviel 's direct supervisor at societe generale 's delta one trading desk , a report friday in the paris-based international herald tribune identified him as eric cordelle .

" numerous operations of a fraudulent nature by jerome kerviel were carried out by this assistant trader , " the report states , without naming him . but the international herald tribune identified him as thomas mougard and reported that he , too , would be fired as a result of the findings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.05.2008 eurovision song contest : europe 's cultural carnival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's pirates of the sea are a long shot , though they have that old-school eurovision feel the world 's largest music event takes place in belgrade on saturday , may 24 , as participants from 43 nations compete for the eurovision title in all their outlandish and freakish glory . critics of the current state of the eurovision song contest think there 's only one thing left to do . " the best thing would be to abolish it , " said one anonymous observer .
" it 's turned into a complete joke .
the songs are horrible and neighboring countries just vote for each other . " gone are the good old days , when english was not the lingua franca and the contest still went by grand prix de la chanson d 'eurovision - the days , when the competition was all about composers and songwriters and less about scurrilities and costumes . swiss glamour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still elegant : lys assia the first eurovision took place in the swiss town of lugano in 1956 .
switzerland 's glamorous lys assia kept the trophy in the country .
back then , only seven countries participated in the event , which began turning into a major event by the late 1960s . it 's even turned into a political nightmare from time to time - as was the case of the spanish victory in 1968 while dictator franco was still in power .
to this day , singer massiel , who is actually called maria de los angeles santamaria espinosa , remains a hero in her country - after all , she snapped away the prize from britain 's cliff richards . the authors of a spanish documentary recently suggested that franco might have helped with a bit of manipulation .
while there 's no proof for such allegations , eurovision 's voting system remains controversial as countries seem to forget about the larger european idea when it comes to picking their favorite . nasty nepotism neighboring countries shower each other with points - especially those of the former soviet union and warsaw pact as well as the new states of the former yugoslavia , who seem to have forgotten - at least as far as the contest is concerned - that they were fighting wars with each other until recently . eurovision officials have been trying to deal with the problem by introducing new rules : this year , two semi-finals , held on the tuesday and thursday before the final , were meant to prevent block voting by separating neighbors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a white guitar and sparkly dress was all nicole needed after all , it 's meant to be a peaceful contest and only peace can lead to victory - as germany 's sole winner , nicole , can attest .
in 1982 , she made germans proud by winning with " a little bit of peace . " but the only real hit song to emerge from the competition is swedish group abba 's " waterloo " in 1979 .
it jumpstarted the group 's ascent to world stardom - a feat no other eurovision participant has managed to replicate so far . grandmas and loincloths the main reason for eurovision 's metamorphosis into a bizarre festival of outrageous performers was a decision to end the tradition of having expert juries from each country vote for the winners .
instead the process was opened up to the entire population via voting over the phone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a loincloth helped ukraine 's ruslana win in 2004 on the one hand , the switch led to a boost in viewer ratings .
on the other hand , it brought an end to clean-cut pretty ladies and handsome young fellows singing lovely songs .
they were replaced by men dressed as female flight attendants , grandmothers with drums , wild dancers in leather loincloths and grizzly monster rockers from finland . this year wo n't be that different : the roaring finns are back , france may commit a major faux pas by singing in english , and ireland is sending a turkey doll . the secret of success will this be the eurovision status quo from here to eternity ?
maybe not : last year 's winner , serbia 's marija serifovic , was quite normal when compared to the freaky rest . unfortunately , there 's no secret to success , and germany , for one , has been trying for decades to break the spell of being relegated to the lower ranks year after year .
last year , some people suggested germany should ask acclaimed writer botho strauss to take care of the lyrics and find some suburban transsexuals who would yell abuse at the balkan states . the germans nixed that idea and are sending girl group " no angels " to belgrade .
their song 's called " disappear " - not exactly an optimistic title , but maybe it 'll just do the trick . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.05.2008 eurovision song contest : europe 's cultural carnival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's pirates of the sea are a long shot , though they have that old-school eurovision feel the world 's largest music event takes place in belgrade on saturday , may 24 , as participants from 43 nations compete for the eurovision title in all their outlandish and freakish glory . critics of the current state of the eurovision song contest think there 's only one thing left to do . " the best thing would be to abolish it , " said one anonymous observer .
" it 's turned into a complete joke .
the songs are horrible and neighboring countries just vote for each other . " gone are the good old days , when english was not the lingua franca and the contest still went by grand prix de la chanson d 'eurovision - the days , when the competition was all about composers and songwriters and less about scurrilities and costumes . swiss glamour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still elegant : lys assia the first eurovision took place in the swiss town of lugano in 1956 .
switzerland 's glamorous lys assia kept the trophy in the country .
back then , only seven countries participated in the event , which began turning into a major event by the late 1960s . it 's even turned into a political nightmare from time to time - as was the case of the spanish victory in 1968 while dictator franco was still in power .
to this day , singer massiel , who is actually called maria de los angeles santamaria espinosa , remains a hero in her country - after all , she snapped away the prize from britain 's cliff richards . the authors of a spanish documentary recently suggested that franco might have helped with a bit of manipulation .
while there 's no proof for such allegations , eurovision 's voting system remains controversial as countries seem to forget about the larger european idea when it comes to picking their favorite . nasty nepotism neighboring countries shower each other with points - especially those of the former soviet union and warsaw pact as well as the new states of the former yugoslavia , who seem to have forgotten - at least as far as the contest is concerned - that they were fighting wars with each other until recently . eurovision officials have been trying to deal with the problem by introducing new rules : this year , two semi-finals , held on the tuesday and thursday before the final , were meant to prevent block voting by separating neighbors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a white guitar and sparkly dress was all nicole needed after all , it 's meant to be a peaceful contest and only peace can lead to victory - as germany 's sole winner , nicole , can attest .
in 1982 , she made germans proud by winning with " a little bit of peace . " but the only real hit song to emerge from the competition is swedish group abba 's " waterloo " in 1979 .
it jumpstarted the group 's ascent to world stardom - a feat no other eurovision participant has managed to replicate so far . grandmas and loincloths the main reason for eurovision 's metamorphosis into a bizarre festival of outrageous performers was a decision to end the tradition of having expert juries from each country vote for the winners .
instead the process was opened up to the entire population via voting over the phone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a loincloth helped ukraine 's ruslana win in 2004 on the one hand , the switch led to a boost in viewer ratings .
on the other hand , it brought an end to clean-cut pretty ladies and handsome young fellows singing lovely songs .
they were replaced by men dressed as female flight attendants , grandmothers with drums , wild dancers in leather loincloths and grizzly monster rockers from finland . this year wo n't be that different : the roaring finns are back , france may commit a major faux pas by singing in english , and ireland is sending a turkey doll . the secret of success will this be the eurovision status quo from here to eternity ?
maybe not : last year 's winner , serbia 's marija serifovic , was quite normal when compared to the freaky rest . unfortunately , there 's no secret to success , and germany , for one , has been trying for decades to break the spell of being relegated to the lower ranks year after year .
last year , some people suggested germany should ask acclaimed writer botho strauss to take care of the lyrics and find some suburban transsexuals who would yell abuse at the balkan states . the germans nixed that idea and are sending girl group " no angels " to belgrade .
their song 's called " disappear " - not exactly an optimistic title , but maybe it 'll just do the trick . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voigt told supporters the government had failed in 2003 in a law case to ban the npd and was now trying to undermine the group by " drying up " its income .
he said a fine for filing fraudulent accounts had dealt a " serious blow " to the party .
the npd has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies , but has never won seats at federal level because of a rule blocking representation to groups with less than 5 per cent of the national vote .
about 2,000 people attended two anti-npd rallies in bamberg .
after lethal clashes between the opponents on may 1 in hamburg , riot police kept a close eye on about 450 militant leftists who marched into bamberg from its railway station to confront the npd .
police detained 19 , but there was no major trouble .
bamberg mayor calls for peaceful protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protestors gather in bamburg mainstream groups attended a " festival for democracy " on bamberg 's main square , where mayor andreas starke said his city had vainly sought by legal means to prevent the npd conference taking place there .
he called for anti-npd protests to be peaceful .
" this party stokes hate and prejudices , it 's racist and anti-semitic .
we , on the other hand , avow ourselves to the values of the constitution , to freedom , tolerance and human rights , " he said .
anti-subversion agencies who monitor the npd estimate its card-carrying membership has grown recently by 1,000 to 7,000 as germany neo-nazis rally to it .
the npd denies that it is neo-nazi .
german law outlaws neo-nazi organizations .
in the northern german port city of kiel , police counted 1,200 demonstrators saturday at an anti-npd rally .
the protesters were alarmed by poll data suggesting the npd would win some seats in the kiel city council in an election on sunday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the best thing would be to abolish it , " said one anonymous observer .
" it 's turned into a complete joke .
the songs are horrible and neighboring countries just vote for each other . " gone are the good old days , when english was not the lingua franca and the contest still went by grand prix de la chanson d 'eurovision - the days , when the competition was all about composers and songwriters and less about scurrilities and costumes . swiss glamour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still elegant : lys assia the first eurovision took place in the swiss town of lugano in 1956 .
switzerland 's glamorous lys assia kept the trophy in the country .
back then , only seven countries participated in the event , which began turning into a major event by the late 1960s . it 's even turned into a political nightmare from time to time - as was the case of the spanish victory in 1968 while dictator franco was still in power .
to this day , singer massiel , who is actually called maria de los angeles santamaria espinosa , remains a hero in her country - after all , she snapped away the prize from britain 's cliff richards . the authors of a spanish documentary recently suggested that franco might have helped with a bit of manipulation .
while there 's no proof for such allegations , eurovision 's voting system remains controversial as countries seem to forget about the larger european idea when it comes to picking their favorite . nasty nepotism neighboring countries shower each other with points - especially those of the former soviet union and warsaw pact as well as the new states of the former yugoslavia , who seem to have forgotten - at least as far as the contest is concerned - that they were fighting wars with each other until recently . eurovision officials have been trying to deal with the problem by introducing new rules : this year , two semi-finals , held on the tuesday and thursday before the final , were meant to prevent block voting by separating neighbors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a white guitar and sparkly dress was all nicole needed after all , it 's meant to be a peaceful contest and only peace can lead to victory - as germany 's sole winner , nicole , can attest .
in 1982 , she made germans proud by winning with " a little bit of peace . " but the only real hit song to emerge from the competition is swedish group abba 's " waterloo " in 1979 .
it jumpstarted the group 's ascent to world stardom - a feat no other eurovision participant has managed to replicate so far . grandmas and loincloths the main reason for eurovision 's metamorphosis into a bizarre festival of outrageous performers was a decision to end the tradition of having expert juries from each country vote for the winners .
instead the process was opened up to the entire population via voting over the phone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a loincloth helped ukraine 's ruslana win in 2004 on the one hand , the switch led to a boost in viewer ratings .
on the other hand , it brought an end to clean-cut pretty ladies and handsome young fellows singing lovely songs .
they were replaced by men dressed as female flight attendants , grandmothers with drums , wild dancers in leather loincloths and grizzly monster rockers from finland . this year wo n't be that different : the roaring finns are back , france may commit a major faux pas by singing in english , and ireland is sending a turkey doll . the secret of success will this be the eurovision status quo from here to eternity ?
maybe not : last year 's winner , serbia 's marija serifovic , was quite normal when compared to the freaky rest . unfortunately , there 's no secret to success , and germany , for one , has been trying for decades to break the spell of being relegated to the lower ranks year after year .
last year , some people suggested germany should ask acclaimed writer botho strauss to take care of the lyrics and find some suburban transsexuals who would yell abuse at the balkan states . the germans nixed that idea and are sending girl group " no angels " to belgrade .
their song 's called " disappear " - not exactly an optimistic title , but maybe it 'll just do the trick . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eleven of germany 's 16 state premiers belong to the cdu or its csu bavarian sister party .
a catholic leader of the sorb people , germany 's slavic-language minority , tillich is set to take over the eastern german state that has prospered best in two harsh decades since the collapse of german communism wiped out the region 's industry .
saxony has rebuilt around its car and semiconductor industries , but its finances were weakened when a state-guaranteed bank invested in us securities that became nearly worthless in the subprime financial crisis .
tillich , until now state finance minister , was overwhelmingly elected chairman at a party convention in zwickau with no opponent .
the state assembly in dresden , which appoints the saxon premier , is set to elect milbradt 's successor on wednesday .
milbradt said the main reason he was retiring was to usher in a change of generation , but he told a reporter he had also become fed up with carping from the junior partner in his coalition , the social democratic party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voigt told supporters the government had failed in 2003 in a law case to ban the npd and was now trying to undermine the group by " drying up " its income .
he said a fine for filing fraudulent accounts had dealt a " serious blow " to the party .
the npd has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies , but has never won seats at federal level because of a rule blocking representation to groups with less than 5 per cent of the national vote .
about 2,000 people attended two anti-npd rallies in bamberg .
after lethal clashes between the opponents on may 1 in hamburg , riot police kept a close eye on about 450 militant leftists who marched into bamberg from its railway station to confront the npd .
police detained 19 , but there was no major trouble .

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .

" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .

" they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voigt told supporters the government had failed in 2003 in a law case to ban the npd and was now trying to undermine the group by " drying up " its income .
he said a fine for filing fraudulent accounts had dealt a " serious blow " to the party .
the npd has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies , but has never won seats at federal level because of a rule blocking representation to groups with less than 5 per cent of the national vote .
about 2,000 people attended two anti-npd rallies in bamberg .
after lethal clashes between the opponents on may 1 in hamburg , riot police kept a close eye on about 450 militant leftists who marched into bamberg from its railway station to confront the npd .
police detained 19 , but there was no major trouble .
bamberg mayor calls for peaceful protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protestors gather in bamburg mainstream groups attended a " festival for democracy " on bamberg 's main square , where mayor andreas starke said his city had vainly sought by legal means to prevent the npd conference taking place there .
he called for anti-npd protests to be peaceful .
" this party stokes hate and prejudices , it 's racist and anti-semitic .
we , on the other hand , avow ourselves to the values of the constitution , to freedom , tolerance and human rights , " he said .

other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .

switzerland 's glamorous lys assia kept the trophy in the country .
back then , only seven countries participated in the event , which began turning into a major event by the late 1960s . it 's even turned into a political nightmare from time to time - as was the case of the spanish victory in 1968 while dictator franco was still in power .
to this day , singer massiel , who is actually called maria de los angeles santamaria espinosa , remains a hero in her country - after all , she snapped away the prize from britain 's cliff richards . the authors of a spanish documentary recently suggested that franco might have helped with a bit of manipulation .
while there 's no proof for such allegations , eurovision 's voting system remains controversial as countries seem to forget about the larger european idea when it comes to picking their favorite . nasty nepotism neighboring countries shower each other with points - especially those of the former soviet union and warsaw pact as well as the new states of the former yugoslavia , who seem to have forgotten - at least as far as the contest is concerned - that they were fighting wars with each other until recently . eurovision officials have been trying to deal with the problem by introducing new rules : this year , two semi-finals , held on the tuesday and thursday before the final , were meant to prevent block voting by separating neighbors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a white guitar and sparkly dress was all nicole needed after all , it 's meant to be a peaceful contest and only peace can lead to victory - as germany 's sole winner , nicole , can attest .
in 1982 , she made germans proud by winning with " a little bit of peace . " but the only real hit song to emerge from the competition is swedish group abba 's " waterloo " in 1979 .
it jumpstarted the group 's ascent to world stardom - a feat no other eurovision participant has managed to replicate so far . grandmas and loincloths the main reason for eurovision 's metamorphosis into a bizarre festival of outrageous performers was a decision to end the tradition of having expert juries from each country vote for the winners .

on the other hand , it brought an end to clean-cut pretty ladies and handsome young fellows singing lovely songs .
they were replaced by men dressed as female flight attendants , grandmothers with drums , wild dancers in leather loincloths and grizzly monster rockers from finland . this year wo n't be that different : the roaring finns are back , france may commit a major faux pas by singing in english , and ireland is sending a turkey doll . the secret of success will this be the eurovision status quo from here to eternity ?
maybe not : last year 's winner , serbia 's marija serifovic , was quite normal when compared to the freaky rest . unfortunately , there 's no secret to success , and germany , for one , has been trying for decades to break the spell of being relegated to the lower ranks year after year .
last year , some people suggested germany should ask acclaimed writer botho strauss to take care of the lyrics and find some suburban transsexuals who would yell abuse at the balkan states . the germans nixed that idea and are sending girl group " no angels " to belgrade .
their song 's called " disappear " - not exactly an optimistic title , but maybe it 'll just do the trick . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it jumpstarted the group 's ascent to world stardom - a feat no other eurovision participant has managed to replicate so far . grandmas and loincloths the main reason for eurovision 's metamorphosis into a bizarre festival of outrageous performers was a decision to end the tradition of having expert juries from each country vote for the winners .
instead the process was opened up to the entire population via voting over the phone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a loincloth helped ukraine 's ruslana win in 2004 on the one hand , the switch led to a boost in viewer ratings .
on the other hand , it brought an end to clean-cut pretty ladies and handsome young fellows singing lovely songs .
they were replaced by men dressed as female flight attendants , grandmothers with drums , wild dancers in leather loincloths and grizzly monster rockers from finland . this year wo n't be that different : the roaring finns are back , france may commit a major faux pas by singing in english , and ireland is sending a turkey doll . the secret of success will this be the eurovision status quo from here to eternity ?
maybe not : last year 's winner , serbia 's marija serifovic , was quite normal when compared to the freaky rest . unfortunately , there 's no secret to success , and germany , for one , has been trying for decades to break the spell of being relegated to the lower ranks year after year .
last year , some people suggested germany should ask acclaimed writer botho strauss to take care of the lyrics and find some suburban transsexuals who would yell abuse at the balkan states . the germans nixed that idea and are sending girl group " no angels " to belgrade .
their song 's called " disappear " - not exactly an optimistic title , but maybe it 'll just do the trick . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fraud was facilitated or its detection delayed by the weakness of the supervision of the trader and of the control mechanism of market activities , " the report states . kerviel 's supervisors , " who formed the first level of control , proved to be negligent in the supervision of his activities , " the report went on to say . the auditors also found that kerviel 's direct supervisor had " exhibited an inappropriate tolerance for the taking of -lsb- unauthorized trading -rsb- positions " by kerviel on the market . although the report does not name kerviel 's direct supervisor at societe generale 's delta one trading desk , a report friday in the paris-based international herald tribune identified him as eric cordelle .
the newspaper said that cordelle and delta one head martial rouyere would be fired . " indications of complicity " in addition , the auditors ' report stated that cordelle " lacked experience in brokerage and had not been sufficiently trained in his new functions . " the report also revealed that the auditors had found " indications of complicity " in the fraud by an " assistant trader " of kerviel 's , the first suggestion that he had not worked alone . " numerous operations of a fraudulent nature by jerome kerviel were carried out by this assistant trader , " the report states , without naming him . but the international herald tribune identified him as thomas mougard and reported that he , too , would be fired as a result of the findings .
high risk the newspaper said that the conclusion that kerviel was not the only employee at societe generale responsible for the fraud could make the bank vulnerable to a very costly class-action lawsuit filed in the united states . kerviel , who is under investigation on suspicion of forgery and breach of trust , said he did not carry out the scheme for personal gain but merely to make money for the bank and to impress his superiors . the bank discovered the scheme in january of this year , after kerviel had secretly exposed it to a risk of 50 billion euros through his unauthorized trades . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?

they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .

" they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tillich , until now state finance minister , was overwhelmingly elected chairman at a party convention in zwickau with no opponent .
the state assembly in dresden , which appoints the saxon premier , is set to elect milbradt 's successor on wednesday .

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .
a poll published last week showed a majority of two-to-one in favor of the treaty among voters who have made up their minds .
however , almost half of irish voters are still undecided or indifferent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fraud was facilitated or its detection delayed by the weakness of the supervision of the trader and of the control mechanism of market activities , " the report states . kerviel 's supervisors , " who formed the first level of control , proved to be negligent in the supervision of his activities , " the report went on to say . the auditors also found that kerviel 's direct supervisor had " exhibited an inappropriate tolerance for the taking of -lsb- unauthorized trading -rsb- positions " by kerviel on the market . although the report does not name kerviel 's direct supervisor at societe generale 's delta one trading desk , a report friday in the paris-based international herald tribune identified him as eric cordelle .

high risk the newspaper said that the conclusion that kerviel was not the only employee at societe generale responsible for the fraud could make the bank vulnerable to a very costly class-action lawsuit filed in the united states . kerviel , who is under investigation on suspicion of forgery and breach of trust , said he did not carry out the scheme for personal gain but merely to make money for the bank and to impress his superiors . the bank discovered the scheme in january of this year , after kerviel had secretly exposed it to a risk of 50 billion euros through his unauthorized trades . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .

european commissioner charlie mccreevy has said that no " sane person " would want to read the european union 's lisbon treaty , the irish independent reported saturday , may 24 . speaking in dublin on friday , mccreevy , european commissioner for the internal market and services , said " i do n't expect ordinary decent irish people , or anywhere in the globe , to be sitting down and spending hours and hours reading sections about subsections referring to articles about sub-articles .
but there is sufficient analysis done . "
the former irish finance minister admitted he has n't read the entire treaty himself and said he does n't expect " any sane and sensible person " to read it from cover to cover .
mccreevy was in dublin to help campaign for a yes vote in ireland 's june 12th referendum on the reform treaty aimed at simplifying the decision-making process in the 27-member eu .
it is a replacement for the failed eu constitution rejected by french and dutch voters .
ireland is the only eu member to hold a public referendum on the treaty .

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eleven of germany 's 16 state premiers belong to the cdu or its csu bavarian sister party .
a catholic leader of the sorb people , germany 's slavic-language minority , tillich is set to take over the eastern german state that has prospered best in two harsh decades since the collapse of german communism wiped out the region 's industry .
saxony has rebuilt around its car and semiconductor industries , but its finances were weakened when a state-guaranteed bank invested in us securities that became nearly worthless in the subprime financial crisis .
tillich , until now state finance minister , was overwhelmingly elected chairman at a party convention in zwickau with no opponent .
the state assembly in dresden , which appoints the saxon premier , is set to elect milbradt 's successor on wednesday .
milbradt said the main reason he was retiring was to usher in a change of generation , but he told a reporter he had also become fed up with carping from the junior partner in his coalition , the social democratic party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a catholic leader of the sorb people , germany 's slavic-language minority , tillich is set to take over the eastern german state that has prospered best in two harsh decades since the collapse of german communism wiped out the region 's industry .

the state assembly in dresden , which appoints the saxon premier , is set to elect milbradt 's successor on wednesday .

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's particularly traumatic for children .
the eu is now trying to alleviate the problem . elena selishev is screaming at the top of her lungs .
together with other asylum seekers and illegal immigrants , she 's come to the european parliament in brussels to voice her anger about the eu 's deportation policy .
for the past eight years , she 's been waiting to hear about her application for asylum . " it 's unbearable - especially for my three children , " said the 35-year-old woman from uzbekistan .
" they finally want to get proper documents and lead a normal life . " the rules of waiting selishev and her husband , konstantin , came to belgium in 2000 and applied for asylum .
the couple felt persecuted in their home country and exposed to criminal violence - that 's the extent of the information they 're willing to give . the belgian authorities rejected their application and the appeal is still pending .
that 's why the family has been waiting - in a reception camp for asylum seekers in the flemish town of lanaken , not far from the dutch border . the family shares a 15 square meter -lrb- 161 square feet -rrb- room . the rules are strict : visitors are not allowed to enter the building ; food is served at set times in the cantine ; working outside the camp is forbidden . treated like a criminal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this the only way authorities can handle young asylum seekers ?
selishev 's children are shy .
they stopped trusting strangers last november , when the police picked up the family from their apartment and even handcuffed the 14-year-old son , nikita , selishev said . " he had to empty all of his pockets , " she said , adding that he 's been scared ever since .
" they treated him like a criminal . " konstantin selishev had been stopped by police while walking on the street .
he was n't carrying his papers on him and was therefore declared an illegal immigrant .
together with his entire family , he was brought to a deportation prison at brussels airport - and remained there for two months . " it was horrible , " nikita said , adding that they had to share a room with 20 other people , many of whom smoked .
" it was difficult for us to sleep . " they were only allowed to leave the room once a day at noontime - for 10 to 15 minutes . will changes help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the eu wo n't become easier with the new directive the european parliament is now calling for an end to these inhumane conditions , especially for children .
a new " return directive , " which is expected to be passed by lawmakers in the first week of june , will specifically address the needs of children . " they have to get access to education and the family has to be able to stay together as a unit , " said manfred weber , an eu parliamentarian and member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union . despite the plans to protect children , nongovernmental organizations have criticized the directive .
they say that it would expressly give authorities the right to detain children for up to 18 months .
child protection experts in belgium , for example , worry that while most people still see deportation detention as inhumane right now , this might change once it becomes law . the belgian government currently plans to set up special prisons for families , where children can be looked after by a tutor and attend school . the selishevs were actually released from detention after two months after the authorities discovered that they had made a mistake .
since the family 's asylum application is still pending , it was illegal to arrest them . all the selishevs can do now is to hope and wait for a positive decision . that 's the only thing that can save them from being detained yet again - and deported . ruth reichstein -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must position ourselves to meet these challenges , " she said .
" fortunately , the issue has changed in the consciousness of many and people have become more aware . "
merkel spoke as the united nations conference on biodiversity , which she opened last week , continued in bonn .
the meeting , which runs from may 19-30 , brings together around 5,000 representatives from 190 countries .
as well as merkel , international leaders such un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva are attending .
its aim is to " reduce significantly " the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 , a target laid down at the rio earth summit in 1992 and the sustainable development summit in johannesburg a decade later .
one of the most important global political issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel talked about meeting biodiversity challenges german environment minister sigmar gabriel said efforts to save threatened species from extinction echoes merkel 's comments on extinction by saying it was one of the most important global political issues along with measures to combat climate change .
the conference agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as the question how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity .
other themes include tapping traditional knowledge on medicines , the need to promote biodiversity in the world 's poorest cities and the impact of biofuels on agriculture .
gabriel appealed to brazil and other nations to show willingness to compromise so that an agreement taking into account the interests of both the world 's richest and poorest countries could be reached .
" i hope that brazil shows more flexibility , " he said in reference to the south american powerhouse 's decision to link progress at the conference to concessions in world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks .
" adopting such a hard-line position will not benefit them in the long run , " the minister said .
gabriel talks of biopiracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists know the importance of biodiversity gabriel said germany wanted to see an equal sharing of the benefits arising from the use of animal and plant life in products made by the pharmaceutical industry .
" developing countries are quite right to describe it as biopiracy when industrial nations help themselves to genetic resources in the rain forests and produce medicines from them without paying a cent in return , " he said .
the ninth conference of the parties to the convention biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- is the last major gathering before the 2010 target date .
its central aim is to draft a document similar to the kyoto protocol on climate change to take over after 2010 .
the organizers are keen to secure binding commitment to clearly laid down targets , along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol global warming and the successor agreement which began to take shape at the un conference on climate change in bali in december . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voigt told supporters the government had failed in 2003 in a law case to ban the npd and was now trying to undermine the group by " drying up " its income .
he said a fine for filing fraudulent accounts had dealt a " serious blow " to the party .
the npd has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies , but has never won seats at federal level because of a rule blocking representation to groups with less than 5 per cent of the national vote .
about 2,000 people attended two anti-npd rallies in bamberg .
after lethal clashes between the opponents on may 1 in hamburg , riot police kept a close eye on about 450 militant leftists who marched into bamberg from its railway station to confront the npd .
police detained 19 , but there was no major trouble .
bamberg mayor calls for peaceful protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protestors gather in bamburg mainstream groups attended a " festival for democracy " on bamberg 's main square , where mayor andreas starke said his city had vainly sought by legal means to prevent the npd conference taking place there .
he called for anti-npd protests to be peaceful .
" this party stokes hate and prejudices , it 's racist and anti-semitic .
we , on the other hand , avow ourselves to the values of the constitution , to freedom , tolerance and human rights , " he said .
anti-subversion agencies who monitor the npd estimate its card-carrying membership has grown recently by 1,000 to 7,000 as germany neo-nazis rally to it .
the npd denies that it is neo-nazi .
german law outlaws neo-nazi organizations .
in the northern german port city of kiel , police counted 1,200 demonstrators saturday at an anti-npd rally .
the protesters were alarmed by poll data suggesting the npd would win some seats in the kiel city council in an election on sunday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
