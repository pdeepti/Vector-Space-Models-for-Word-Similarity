" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .

" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "

" we consider the doha agreement as a first step but a very important step to settle conflicts among the various factions in lebanon , " steinmeier said . calls to give up violence the arab-mediated deal , signed earlier in may in doha , qatar , got lebanon 's us-backed parliament majority and the hezbollah-led opposition to agree to form a national unity government and halt the crisis which last month escalated into violence that pushed lebanon to the brink of a new civil war .

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .
far-right party accused of racism more than 20 percent of switzerland 's population is foreign-born - the highest number in europe - and the issue is routinely seized on by the populist swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
this weekend 's vote is the sixth time it has launched a popular referendum on the subject .
switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .
the svp has transformed itself from a small farmers ' party into a fiercely populist force with a strong anti-immigrant message over the past decades , and scored 29 percent in last october 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait for a bus in front of the controversial svp poster deemed racist in last year 's polls the party was accused of racism by a united nations expert during last year 's general election for a poster showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag .
this time around , the party plastered the country with posters showing a sea of black and brown hands grasping for a pile of swiss passports , with the word " stop ! " in huge letters .
with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .
those who want to get swiss passports must live in switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests on swiss language and culture , and those born in switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .

this weekend 's vote is the sixth time it has launched a popular referendum on the subject .
switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .
the svp has transformed itself from a small farmers ' party into a fiercely populist force with a strong anti-immigrant message over the past decades , and scored 29 percent in last october 's general elections .

with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .

" we consider the doha agreement as a first step but a very important step to settle conflicts among the various factions in lebanon , " steinmeier said . calls to give up violence the arab-mediated deal , signed earlier in may in doha , qatar , got lebanon 's us-backed parliament majority and the hezbollah-led opposition to agree to form a national unity government and halt the crisis which last month escalated into violence that pushed lebanon to the brink of a new civil war .
sectarian clashes left 82 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , with michel suleiman " the election of a president and the formation of a government are signs of hope , " steinmeier said , emphasising that the deal reached in qatar says that force and weapons should not be used to resolve conflict . " violent acts should not be repeated and the government should work on disarming all militias , " steinmeier said . hezbollah is the only armed force left in lebanon after all militias were disarmed following the national reconciliation that ended lebanon 's 1975-90 civil war . hezbollah was considered by the government as " a resistance fighting an occupation force -lrb- israel -rrb- . " " a new beginning with syria " beirut is steinmeier 's first stop on a middle east tour that will also take in jerusalem and ramallah . steinmeier said it was " encouraging " that suleiman 's inaugural speech displayed support for the establishment of an international court to try those behind the assassinations of former lebanese premier rafik hariri in 2005 and other anti-syrian public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of lebanese protested for a full syrian troop withdrawal following hariri 's murder in 2005 syria 's military was in lebanon for three decades until it was forced to withdraw by a local outcry over hariri 's assassination which was widely blamed on damascus .

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .
offices raided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy is a sensitive issue in germany prosecutors investigating the case raided deutsche telekom 's bonn headquarters on thursday .
they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .
a government meeting in berlin on monday with the companies ' chiefs will initiate a dialogue about how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws , an interior ministry spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

helped by czech tax breaks and using european meat , maling plans to produce 10,000 tons a year at its 400-million-koruny -lrb- 16.5 million-euro , $ 25.4-million -rrb- plant , production manager jiri vancura said .
" they need to be somewhere in the eu so the plant meets all the standards , " he said .
" they otherwise ca n't export to the markets where they want to - and once used to - be . "
the new canning factory in hrobcice , once a farming village of 950 , is china 's second manufacturing investment in the czech republic , which joined the european union in 2004 .

sichuan changhong was the first electronics firm to begin churning out flat-screen televisions in the czech republic last year .
other chinese investors have settled in bulgaria and hungary .
changhong spent 320 million czech crowns on its plant in nymburk , east of prague , aiming for a share of the 35 million tv sets sold in europe annually .
government incentives played a role - in maling 's case a tax break of up to 3.5 million euros applicable within five years , as well as lower investment and labor costs than in western europe .
" we were looking at how expensive it would be to build the plant in germany , " vancura said .
" just the construction would cost 50 to 100 percent more . "
maling was shopping around the region before finding the right location for the plant .
in the end , vancura said , the company chose the czech republic mainly due to earlier personal contacts .

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .

the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .
offices raided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy is a sensitive issue in germany prosecutors investigating the case raided deutsche telekom 's bonn headquarters on thursday .
they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .
a government meeting in berlin on monday with the companies ' chiefs will initiate a dialogue about how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws , an interior ministry spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we consider the doha agreement as a first step but a very important step to settle conflicts among the various factions in lebanon , " steinmeier said . calls to give up violence the arab-mediated deal , signed earlier in may in doha , qatar , got lebanon 's us-backed parliament majority and the hezbollah-led opposition to agree to form a national unity government and halt the crisis which last month escalated into violence that pushed lebanon to the brink of a new civil war .
sectarian clashes left 82 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , with michel suleiman " the election of a president and the formation of a government are signs of hope , " steinmeier said , emphasising that the deal reached in qatar says that force and weapons should not be used to resolve conflict . " violent acts should not be repeated and the government should work on disarming all militias , " steinmeier said . hezbollah is the only armed force left in lebanon after all militias were disarmed following the national reconciliation that ended lebanon 's 1975-90 civil war . hezbollah was considered by the government as " a resistance fighting an occupation force -lrb- israel -rrb- . " " a new beginning with syria " beirut is steinmeier 's first stop on a middle east tour that will also take in jerusalem and ramallah . steinmeier said it was " encouraging " that suleiman 's inaugural speech displayed support for the establishment of an international court to try those behind the assassinations of former lebanese premier rafik hariri in 2005 and other anti-syrian public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of lebanese protested for a full syrian troop withdrawal following hariri 's murder in 2005 syria 's military was in lebanon for three decades until it was forced to withdraw by a local outcry over hariri 's assassination which was widely blamed on damascus .

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .
" rwe will now commit to selling off its gas transportation network in germany to an independent third party within the next two years , " it added .
the news is likely to come as a blow to firms such as gaz de france and russia 's gazprom , who are currently fighting european union plans to break up the continent 's energy giants in order to boost competition .
" this decision was not an easy one for rwe to take , " the company said , adding that it was not linked to ongoing talks about separating its electricity and gas transmission networks .
abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "
the proposal provoked fierce opposition in several european countries , including russia , with eight eu states - austria , bulgaria , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - penning a joint letter lambasting the idea .
but on feb .
28 , e.on sent shockwaves through europe by saying that it was ready to " unbundle " itself by selling off its electricity transmission network - thereby greatly boosting its chance of avoiding a massive anti-trust fine from the commission .
eu member states are expected to make a final decision on the unbundling proposal by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .

switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .
" rwe will now commit to selling off its gas transportation network in germany to an independent third party within the next two years , " it added .
the news is likely to come as a blow to firms such as gaz de france and russia 's gazprom , who are currently fighting european union plans to break up the continent 's energy giants in order to boost competition .
" this decision was not an easy one for rwe to take , " the company said , adding that it was not linked to ongoing talks about separating its electricity and gas transmission networks .
abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "
the proposal provoked fierce opposition in several european countries , including russia , with eight eu states - austria , bulgaria , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - penning a joint letter lambasting the idea .
but on feb .
28 , e.on sent shockwaves through europe by saying that it was ready to " unbundle " itself by selling off its electricity transmission network - thereby greatly boosting its chance of avoiding a massive anti-trust fine from the commission .
eu member states are expected to make a final decision on the unbundling proposal by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sichuan changhong was the first electronics firm to begin churning out flat-screen televisions in the czech republic last year .
other chinese investors have settled in bulgaria and hungary .
changhong spent 320 million czech crowns on its plant in nymburk , east of prague , aiming for a share of the 35 million tv sets sold in europe annually .
government incentives played a role - in maling 's case a tax break of up to 3.5 million euros applicable within five years , as well as lower investment and labor costs than in western europe .
" we were looking at how expensive it would be to build the plant in germany , " vancura said .
" just the construction would cost 50 to 100 percent more . "
maling was shopping around the region before finding the right location for the plant .

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .
" rwe will now commit to selling off its gas transportation network in germany to an independent third party within the next two years , " it added .
the news is likely to come as a blow to firms such as gaz de france and russia 's gazprom , who are currently fighting european union plans to break up the continent 's energy giants in order to boost competition .
" this decision was not an easy one for rwe to take , " the company said , adding that it was not linked to ongoing talks about separating its electricity and gas transmission networks .
abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .
offices raided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy is a sensitive issue in germany prosecutors investigating the case raided deutsche telekom 's bonn headquarters on thursday .
they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .
a government meeting in berlin on monday with the companies ' chiefs will initiate a dialogue about how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws , an interior ministry spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .
far-right party accused of racism more than 20 percent of switzerland 's population is foreign-born - the highest number in europe - and the issue is routinely seized on by the populist swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
this weekend 's vote is the sixth time it has launched a popular referendum on the subject .
switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .
the svp has transformed itself from a small farmers ' party into a fiercely populist force with a strong anti-immigrant message over the past decades , and scored 29 percent in last october 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait for a bus in front of the controversial svp poster deemed racist in last year 's polls the party was accused of racism by a united nations expert during last year 's general election for a poster showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag .
this time around , the party plastered the country with posters showing a sea of black and brown hands grasping for a pile of swiss passports , with the word " stop ! " in huge letters .
with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .
those who want to get swiss passports must live in switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests on swiss language and culture , and those born in switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .
" rwe will now commit to selling off its gas transportation network in germany to an independent third party within the next two years , " it added .
the news is likely to come as a blow to firms such as gaz de france and russia 's gazprom , who are currently fighting european union plans to break up the continent 's energy giants in order to boost competition .
" this decision was not an easy one for rwe to take , " the company said , adding that it was not linked to ongoing talks about separating its electricity and gas transmission networks .
abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "
the proposal provoked fierce opposition in several european countries , including russia , with eight eu states - austria , bulgaria , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - penning a joint letter lambasting the idea .
but on feb .
28 , e.on sent shockwaves through europe by saying that it was ready to " unbundle " itself by selling off its electricity transmission network - thereby greatly boosting its chance of avoiding a massive anti-trust fine from the commission .
eu member states are expected to make a final decision on the unbundling proposal by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

helped by czech tax breaks and using european meat , maling plans to produce 10,000 tons a year at its 400-million-koruny -lrb- 16.5 million-euro , $ 25.4-million -rrb- plant , production manager jiri vancura said .
" they need to be somewhere in the eu so the plant meets all the standards , " he said .
" they otherwise ca n't export to the markets where they want to - and once used to - be . "
the new canning factory in hrobcice , once a farming village of 950 , is china 's second manufacturing investment in the czech republic , which joined the european union in 2004 .
returning to old communist markets in central and eastern europe , now eu members , is the first goal , firm 's business manager petr valentik said . maling products are set to show up soon on supermarket shelves in the region .
attractive tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants to sell more of its products in europe old czech industries such as textiles and shoe making have been hard hit by chinese competition .

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .
far-right party accused of racism more than 20 percent of switzerland 's population is foreign-born - the highest number in europe - and the issue is routinely seized on by the populist swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
this weekend 's vote is the sixth time it has launched a popular referendum on the subject .
switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .
the svp has transformed itself from a small farmers ' party into a fiercely populist force with a strong anti-immigrant message over the past decades , and scored 29 percent in last october 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait for a bus in front of the controversial svp poster deemed racist in last year 's polls the party was accused of racism by a united nations expert during last year 's general election for a poster showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag .
this time around , the party plastered the country with posters showing a sea of black and brown hands grasping for a pile of swiss passports , with the word " stop ! " in huge letters .
with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .
those who want to get swiss passports must live in switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests on swiss language and culture , and those born in switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .
far-right party accused of racism more than 20 percent of switzerland 's population is foreign-born - the highest number in europe - and the issue is routinely seized on by the populist swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
this weekend 's vote is the sixth time it has launched a popular referendum on the subject .
switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .
the svp has transformed itself from a small farmers ' party into a fiercely populist force with a strong anti-immigrant message over the past decades , and scored 29 percent in last october 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait for a bus in front of the controversial svp poster deemed racist in last year 's polls the party was accused of racism by a united nations expert during last year 's general election for a poster showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag .
this time around , the party plastered the country with posters showing a sea of black and brown hands grasping for a pile of swiss passports , with the word " stop ! " in huge letters .
with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .
those who want to get swiss passports must live in switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests on swiss language and culture , and those born in switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .
children who have one swiss parent and the partners of swiss citizens can benefit from a fast-track procedure . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .
" rwe will now commit to selling off its gas transportation network in germany to an independent third party within the next two years , " it added .
the news is likely to come as a blow to firms such as gaz de france and russia 's gazprom , who are currently fighting european union plans to break up the continent 's energy giants in order to boost competition .
" this decision was not an easy one for rwe to take , " the company said , adding that it was not linked to ongoing talks about separating its electricity and gas transmission networks .
abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "
the proposal provoked fierce opposition in several european countries , including russia , with eight eu states - austria , bulgaria , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - penning a joint letter lambasting the idea .
but on feb .
28 , e.on sent shockwaves through europe by saying that it was ready to " unbundle " itself by selling off its electricity transmission network - thereby greatly boosting its chance of avoiding a massive anti-trust fine from the commission .
eu member states are expected to make a final decision on the unbundling proposal by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .
far-right party accused of racism more than 20 percent of switzerland 's population is foreign-born - the highest number in europe - and the issue is routinely seized on by the populist swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
this weekend 's vote is the sixth time it has launched a popular referendum on the subject .
switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .
the svp has transformed itself from a small farmers ' party into a fiercely populist force with a strong anti-immigrant message over the past decades , and scored 29 percent in last october 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait for a bus in front of the controversial svp poster deemed racist in last year 's polls the party was accused of racism by a united nations expert during last year 's general election for a poster showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag .
this time around , the party plastered the country with posters showing a sea of black and brown hands grasping for a pile of swiss passports , with the word " stop ! " in huge letters .
with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .
those who want to get swiss passports must live in switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests on swiss language and culture , and those born in switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .

helped by czech tax breaks and using european meat , maling plans to produce 10,000 tons a year at its 400-million-koruny -lrb- 16.5 million-euro , $ 25.4-million -rrb- plant , production manager jiri vancura said .
" they need to be somewhere in the eu so the plant meets all the standards , " he said .
" they otherwise ca n't export to the markets where they want to - and once used to - be . "
the new canning factory in hrobcice , once a farming village of 950 , is china 's second manufacturing investment in the czech republic , which joined the european union in 2004 .
returning to old communist markets in central and eastern europe , now eu members , is the first goal , firm 's business manager petr valentik said . maling products are set to show up soon on supermarket shelves in the region .
attractive tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants to sell more of its products in europe old czech industries such as textiles and shoe making have been hard hit by chinese competition .
while taiwanese companies , including electronics makers foxconn and tatung , have helped create new jobs in the central european country since the fall of communism in 1989 , mainland chinese companies have been more cautious .
sichuan changhong was the first electronics firm to begin churning out flat-screen televisions in the czech republic last year .
other chinese investors have settled in bulgaria and hungary .
changhong spent 320 million czech crowns on its plant in nymburk , east of prague , aiming for a share of the 35 million tv sets sold in europe annually .
government incentives played a role - in maling 's case a tax break of up to 3.5 million euros applicable within five years , as well as lower investment and labor costs than in western europe .
" we were looking at how expensive it would be to build the plant in germany , " vancura said .
" just the construction would cost 50 to 100 percent more . "
maling was shopping around the region before finding the right location for the plant .
in the end , vancura said , the company chose the czech republic mainly due to earlier personal contacts .
good for czechs hrobcice mayor bozena zemanova is happy that the chinese manufacturer chose her village , where unemployment only recently declined from around 20 percent to about 12 percent .
while the czech republic and other eastern european countries have a shortage of highly skilled workers , jobs are scarce for the area 's unqualified who once worked on farms , she said .
" it will amount to a windfall for our people , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

helped by czech tax breaks and using european meat , maling plans to produce 10,000 tons a year at its 400-million-koruny -lrb- 16.5 million-euro , $ 25.4-million -rrb- plant , production manager jiri vancura said .
" they need to be somewhere in the eu so the plant meets all the standards , " he said .
" they otherwise ca n't export to the markets where they want to - and once used to - be . "
the new canning factory in hrobcice , once a farming village of 950 , is china 's second manufacturing investment in the czech republic , which joined the european union in 2004 .
returning to old communist markets in central and eastern europe , now eu members , is the first goal , firm 's business manager petr valentik said . maling products are set to show up soon on supermarket shelves in the region .
attractive tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants to sell more of its products in europe old czech industries such as textiles and shoe making have been hard hit by chinese competition .
while taiwanese companies , including electronics makers foxconn and tatung , have helped create new jobs in the central european country since the fall of communism in 1989 , mainland chinese companies have been more cautious .
sichuan changhong was the first electronics firm to begin churning out flat-screen televisions in the czech republic last year .
other chinese investors have settled in bulgaria and hungary .
changhong spent 320 million czech crowns on its plant in nymburk , east of prague , aiming for a share of the 35 million tv sets sold in europe annually .
government incentives played a role - in maling 's case a tax break of up to 3.5 million euros applicable within five years , as well as lower investment and labor costs than in western europe .
" we were looking at how expensive it would be to build the plant in germany , " vancura said .
" just the construction would cost 50 to 100 percent more . "
maling was shopping around the region before finding the right location for the plant .
in the end , vancura said , the company chose the czech republic mainly due to earlier personal contacts .
good for czechs hrobcice mayor bozena zemanova is happy that the chinese manufacturer chose her village , where unemployment only recently declined from around 20 percent to about 12 percent .
while the czech republic and other eastern european countries have a shortage of highly skilled workers , jobs are scarce for the area 's unqualified who once worked on farms , she said .
" it will amount to a windfall for our people , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .

" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .

the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .

abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "
the proposal provoked fierce opposition in several european countries , including russia , with eight eu states - austria , bulgaria , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - penning a joint letter lambasting the idea .
but on feb .
28 , e.on sent shockwaves through europe by saying that it was ready to " unbundle " itself by selling off its electricity transmission network - thereby greatly boosting its chance of avoiding a massive anti-trust fine from the commission .
eu member states are expected to make a final decision on the unbundling proposal by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .
" rwe will now commit to selling off its gas transportation network in germany to an independent third party within the next two years , " it added .
the news is likely to come as a blow to firms such as gaz de france and russia 's gazprom , who are currently fighting european union plans to break up the continent 's energy giants in order to boost competition .
" this decision was not an easy one for rwe to take , " the company said , adding that it was not linked to ongoing talks about separating its electricity and gas transmission networks .
abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "
the proposal provoked fierce opposition in several european countries , including russia , with eight eu states - austria , bulgaria , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - penning a joint letter lambasting the idea .
but on feb .
28 , e.on sent shockwaves through europe by saying that it was ready to " unbundle " itself by selling off its electricity transmission network - thereby greatly boosting its chance of avoiding a massive anti-trust fine from the commission .
eu member states are expected to make a final decision on the unbundling proposal by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .

the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .

helped by czech tax breaks and using european meat , maling plans to produce 10,000 tons a year at its 400-million-koruny -lrb- 16.5 million-euro , $ 25.4-million -rrb- plant , production manager jiri vancura said .
" they need to be somewhere in the eu so the plant meets all the standards , " he said .
" they otherwise ca n't export to the markets where they want to - and once used to - be . "
the new canning factory in hrobcice , once a farming village of 950 , is china 's second manufacturing investment in the czech republic , which joined the european union in 2004 .
returning to old communist markets in central and eastern europe , now eu members , is the first goal , firm 's business manager petr valentik said . maling products are set to show up soon on supermarket shelves in the region .
attractive tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants to sell more of its products in europe old czech industries such as textiles and shoe making have been hard hit by chinese competition .
while taiwanese companies , including electronics makers foxconn and tatung , have helped create new jobs in the central european country since the fall of communism in 1989 , mainland chinese companies have been more cautious .
sichuan changhong was the first electronics firm to begin churning out flat-screen televisions in the czech republic last year .
other chinese investors have settled in bulgaria and hungary .
changhong spent 320 million czech crowns on its plant in nymburk , east of prague , aiming for a share of the 35 million tv sets sold in europe annually .
government incentives played a role - in maling 's case a tax break of up to 3.5 million euros applicable within five years , as well as lower investment and labor costs than in western europe .
" we were looking at how expensive it would be to build the plant in germany , " vancura said .
" just the construction would cost 50 to 100 percent more . "
maling was shopping around the region before finding the right location for the plant .
in the end , vancura said , the company chose the czech republic mainly due to earlier personal contacts .
good for czechs hrobcice mayor bozena zemanova is happy that the chinese manufacturer chose her village , where unemployment only recently declined from around 20 percent to about 12 percent .
while the czech republic and other eastern european countries have a shortage of highly skilled workers , jobs are scarce for the area 's unqualified who once worked on farms , she said .
" it will amount to a windfall for our people , " she said . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .

they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .
offices raided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy is a sensitive issue in germany prosecutors investigating the case raided deutsche telekom 's bonn headquarters on thursday .
they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .
a government meeting in berlin on monday with the companies ' chiefs will initiate a dialogue about how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws , an interior ministry spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .
far-right party accused of racism more than 20 percent of switzerland 's population is foreign-born - the highest number in europe - and the issue is routinely seized on by the populist swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
this weekend 's vote is the sixth time it has launched a popular referendum on the subject .
switzerland 's multi-party government - which includes two svp ministers regarded as moderates - is against the initiative which it deems arbitrary and discriminatory , a view shared by most members of parliament .
the svp has transformed itself from a small farmers ' party into a fiercely populist force with a strong anti-immigrant message over the past decades , and scored 29 percent in last october 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait for a bus in front of the controversial svp poster deemed racist in last year 's polls the party was accused of racism by a united nations expert during last year 's general election for a poster showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag .
this time around , the party plastered the country with posters showing a sea of black and brown hands grasping for a pile of swiss passports , with the word " stop ! " in huge letters .
with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .
those who want to get swiss passports must live in switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests on swiss language and culture , and those born in switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .
offices raided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy is a sensitive issue in germany prosecutors investigating the case raided deutsche telekom 's bonn headquarters on thursday .
they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .
a government meeting in berlin on monday with the companies ' chiefs will initiate a dialogue about how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws , an interior ministry spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people wait for a bus in front of the controversial svp poster deemed racist in last year 's polls the party was accused of racism by a united nations expert during last year 's general election for a poster showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag .
this time around , the party plastered the country with posters showing a sea of black and brown hands grasping for a pile of swiss passports , with the word " stop ! " in huge letters .
with polls showing a lack of support for its proposal , the svp ran advertisements blaming foreign-born residents for violent crime .
switzerland has some of the toughest naturalization laws in europe , defining nationality by virtue of blood .
those who want to get swiss passports must live in switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests on swiss language and culture , and those born in switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .

they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .

" we consider the doha agreement as a first step but a very important step to settle conflicts among the various factions in lebanon , " steinmeier said . calls to give up violence the arab-mediated deal , signed earlier in may in doha , qatar , got lebanon 's us-backed parliament majority and the hezbollah-led opposition to agree to form a national unity government and halt the crisis which last month escalated into violence that pushed lebanon to the brink of a new civil war .
sectarian clashes left 82 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , with michel suleiman " the election of a president and the formation of a government are signs of hope , " steinmeier said , emphasising that the deal reached in qatar says that force and weapons should not be used to resolve conflict . " violent acts should not be repeated and the government should work on disarming all militias , " steinmeier said . hezbollah is the only armed force left in lebanon after all militias were disarmed following the national reconciliation that ended lebanon 's 1975-90 civil war . hezbollah was considered by the government as " a resistance fighting an occupation force -lrb- israel -rrb- . " " a new beginning with syria " beirut is steinmeier 's first stop on a middle east tour that will also take in jerusalem and ramallah . steinmeier said it was " encouraging " that suleiman 's inaugural speech displayed support for the establishment of an international court to try those behind the assassinations of former lebanese premier rafik hariri in 2005 and other anti-syrian public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of lebanese protested for a full syrian troop withdrawal following hariri 's murder in 2005 syria 's military was in lebanon for three decades until it was forced to withdraw by a local outcry over hariri 's assassination which was widely blamed on damascus .
syria has strongly denied any involvement . the german foreign minister underlined that suleiman 's inaugural speech " spoke of a new beginning in relations with syria . " " i hope there will be a normalization of relations and that later there will be an exchange of ambassadors and that syria treats lebanon as a sovereign country , " steinmeier said . he stressed that neighboring syria should " recognize lebanon 's independence " from now on . syria and lebanon have no diplomatic representation . israel frees hezbollah spy german troops has been working in the un naval force patrolling lebanese waters to keep the peace with israel and deter arms shipments to hezbollah . steinmeier said that germany is working closely with the lebanese authorities to enhance the country 's " monitoring of its borders . " germany has given lebanon technical expertise and vehicles in order to start securing its land borders , and is also acting as a mediator in negotiations between hezbollah and israel on a prisoner exchange . on sunday , israel freed hezbollah spy nassim nisr and then deported him to lebanon while the shiite militant group handed over what it said were the remains of israeli soldiers killed in its 2006 war with the jewish state . bildunterschrift : nassim nisr waves to a crowd as he arrives in lebanon " i hope this is a step in the direction of a prisoner exchange , " steinmeier told reporters after meeting prime minister fuad siniora later on sunday . " i am happy that preliminary steps were taken in that direction and hope that this creates a positive dynamic , building mutual trust .

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .
offices raided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy is a sensitive issue in germany prosecutors investigating the case raided deutsche telekom 's bonn headquarters on thursday .
they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .
a government meeting in berlin on monday with the companies ' chiefs will initiate a dialogue about how the industry can improve compliance with privacy laws , an interior ministry spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
the swiss people 's party , the largest in parliament , wanted the secret ballots back and the right to appeal scrapped .

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .
at the time , i had only been in my post for a few days , " he said .

they also confirmed that an investigation has been launched against zumwinkel and former telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke .
the disclosure of the affair has sparked an outcry in germany , where privacy is a particularly sensitive issue ever since the state-sanctioned snooping of the nazi and communist regimes .
the german government demanded on friday that the various telecommunications companies introduce self-regulation to prevent any repeats of the 2005 privacy breach at the country 's biggest phone company .

" we consider the doha agreement as a first step but a very important step to settle conflicts among the various factions in lebanon , " steinmeier said . calls to give up violence the arab-mediated deal , signed earlier in may in doha , qatar , got lebanon 's us-backed parliament majority and the hezbollah-led opposition to agree to form a national unity government and halt the crisis which last month escalated into violence that pushed lebanon to the brink of a new civil war .
sectarian clashes left 82 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , with michel suleiman " the election of a president and the formation of a government are signs of hope , " steinmeier said , emphasising that the deal reached in qatar says that force and weapons should not be used to resolve conflict . " violent acts should not be repeated and the government should work on disarming all militias , " steinmeier said . hezbollah is the only armed force left in lebanon after all militias were disarmed following the national reconciliation that ended lebanon 's 1975-90 civil war . hezbollah was considered by the government as " a resistance fighting an occupation force -lrb- israel -rrb- . " " a new beginning with syria " beirut is steinmeier 's first stop on a middle east tour that will also take in jerusalem and ramallah . steinmeier said it was " encouraging " that suleiman 's inaugural speech displayed support for the establishment of an international court to try those behind the assassinations of former lebanese premier rafik hariri in 2005 and other anti-syrian public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of lebanese protested for a full syrian troop withdrawal following hariri 's murder in 2005 syria 's military was in lebanon for three decades until it was forced to withdraw by a local outcry over hariri 's assassination which was widely blamed on damascus .
syria has strongly denied any involvement . the german foreign minister underlined that suleiman 's inaugural speech " spoke of a new beginning in relations with syria . " " i hope there will be a normalization of relations and that later there will be an exchange of ambassadors and that syria treats lebanon as a sovereign country , " steinmeier said . he stressed that neighboring syria should " recognize lebanon 's independence " from now on . syria and lebanon have no diplomatic representation . israel frees hezbollah spy german troops has been working in the un naval force patrolling lebanese waters to keep the peace with israel and deter arms shipments to hezbollah . steinmeier said that germany is working closely with the lebanese authorities to enhance the country 's " monitoring of its borders . " germany has given lebanon technical expertise and vehicles in order to start securing its land borders , and is also acting as a mediator in negotiations between hezbollah and israel on a prisoner exchange . on sunday , israel freed hezbollah spy nassim nisr and then deported him to lebanon while the shiite militant group handed over what it said were the remains of israeli soldiers killed in its 2006 war with the jewish state . bildunterschrift : nassim nisr waves to a crowd as he arrives in lebanon " i hope this is a step in the direction of a prisoner exchange , " steinmeier told reporters after meeting prime minister fuad siniora later on sunday .

switzerland 's supreme court banned secret ballots five years ago after it emerged that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the balkans , turkey and africa , while approving those from western europe .
it also gave those rejected the right to appeal .

helped by czech tax breaks and using european meat , maling plans to produce 10,000 tons a year at its 400-million-koruny -lrb- 16.5 million-euro , $ 25.4-million -rrb- plant , production manager jiri vancura said .
" they need to be somewhere in the eu so the plant meets all the standards , " he said .
" they otherwise ca n't export to the markets where they want to - and once used to - be . "
the new canning factory in hrobcice , once a farming village of 950 , is china 's second manufacturing investment in the czech republic , which joined the european union in 2004 .
returning to old communist markets in central and eastern europe , now eu members , is the first goal , firm 's business manager petr valentik said . maling products are set to show up soon on supermarket shelves in the region .
attractive tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china wants to sell more of its products in europe old czech industries such as textiles and shoe making have been hard hit by chinese competition .
while taiwanese companies , including electronics makers foxconn and tatung , have helped create new jobs in the central european country since the fall of communism in 1989 , mainland chinese companies have been more cautious .
sichuan changhong was the first electronics firm to begin churning out flat-screen televisions in the czech republic last year .
other chinese investors have settled in bulgaria and hungary .
changhong spent 320 million czech crowns on its plant in nymburk , east of prague , aiming for a share of the 35 million tv sets sold in europe annually .
government incentives played a role - in maling 's case a tax break of up to 3.5 million euros applicable within five years , as well as lower investment and labor costs than in western europe .
" we were looking at how expensive it would be to build the plant in germany , " vancura said .
" just the construction would cost 50 to 100 percent more . "
maling was shopping around the region before finding the right location for the plant .
in the end , vancura said , the company chose the czech republic mainly due to earlier personal contacts .
good for czechs hrobcice mayor bozena zemanova is happy that the chinese manufacturer chose her village , where unemployment only recently declined from around 20 percent to about 12 percent .

" rwe is still convinced that it has complied with the legal requirements in the gas business -lrb- but -rrb- in order to avoid protracted litigation , the group has now decided in favor of a consensual settlement , " it said .
" rwe will now commit to selling off its gas transportation network in germany to an independent third party within the next two years , " it added .
the news is likely to come as a blow to firms such as gaz de france and russia 's gazprom , who are currently fighting european union plans to break up the continent 's energy giants in order to boost competition .
" this decision was not an easy one for rwe to take , " the company said , adding that it was not linked to ongoing talks about separating its electricity and gas transmission networks .
abuse of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is challenging major energy companies across the continent the eu investigation , launched on may 11 , 2007 , was based on the suspicion that rwe " may have abused " its control of gas transmission systems in north rhine-westphalia " by raising rivals ' costs and preventing -lrb- new -rrb- entrants from getting access to capacity on gas transport infrastructure in germany , " a statement said at the time .
the case , which is still ongoing , was one of a number which the commission opened to challenge major energy firms such as germany 's eon and france 's gdf , suspecting that they could be using their status as the owners of gas and electricity transmission systems to keep potential competitors out of the market .
in september the commission went further , proposing that power companies in europe which both sell gas or electricity and control the transmission networks be obliged to sell off their networks - a process known as " unbundling . "
the proposal provoked fierce opposition in several european countries , including russia , with eight eu states - austria , bulgaria , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - penning a joint letter lambasting the idea .
but on feb .
28 , e.on sent shockwaves through europe by saying that it was ready to " unbundle " itself by selling off its electricity transmission network - thereby greatly boosting its chance of avoiding a massive anti-trust fine from the commission .

" we consider the doha agreement as a first step but a very important step to settle conflicts among the various factions in lebanon , " steinmeier said . calls to give up violence the arab-mediated deal , signed earlier in may in doha , qatar , got lebanon 's us-backed parliament majority and the hezbollah-led opposition to agree to form a national unity government and halt the crisis which last month escalated into violence that pushed lebanon to the brink of a new civil war .

" we consider the doha agreement as a first step but a very important step to settle conflicts among the various factions in lebanon , " steinmeier said . calls to give up violence the arab-mediated deal , signed earlier in may in doha , qatar , got lebanon 's us-backed parliament majority and the hezbollah-led opposition to agree to form a national unity government and halt the crisis which last month escalated into violence that pushed lebanon to the brink of a new civil war .

" i can assure our clients : their data is safe with deutsche telekom , " rene obermann said in an interview for bild am sonntag newspaper , published on sunday .
" the misbehavior of a few bad apples in the past does not change this fact .
our staff does good and proper work . "
deutsche telekom conceded earlier this week that it had hired an outside firm to surreptitiously track hundreds of thousands of phone calls in 2005 and perhaps also 2006 by senior executives and journalists to identify the source of leaks to the news media about the company 's internal affairs .
the disclosure , prompted by a report on the web site of news magazine der spiegel , has sparked a storm of protest in germany among privacy advocates , politicians and company labor representatives .
i did n't do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann denied any personal involvement in the affair obermann denied that he was personally involved in the escalating privacy sandal engulfing europe 's largest telecommunications business .
" i learnt of a first case of data abuse at deutsche telekom last summer and did not hide anything , but drew the necessary personal and organizational consequences . "
" everything else was put in the hands of the prosecutors investigating the matter , " said obermann , who took up his post in november 2006 .
der spiegel reported on sunday on it web site that one payment to private detectives hired to track calls by executives to journalists was authorized by an office manager who worked for both obermann and klaus zumwinkel , the former head of the company 's supervisory board .
responding to the report , obermann said : " if this is the case , it happened without my knowledge . "
" i neither saw such an account nor signed off on it .

as welsh forces begin their seasonal crackdown , police urged people not to drive at all after drinking .
one in 20 breath tests last summer was positive , and this year 's push will involve increased stop checks .
gwent police say they will be on the roads 24 hours a day to increase the number of motorists breathalysed .
the campaign , which will be officially launched by dyfed-powys police on 10 june , will also use the crimestoppers anonymous phone line .
officers regularly use information on drink-drivers which has been left on the phone line to follow up and catch them . "
as these events may take place over a number of hours they may lose track of how much they have had to drink " andy edwards , dyfed-powys police , on the danger of drink-driving after barbecues during the campaign last summer 7,970 breath tests were administered in wales .
some 400 of these , or about 5 % , were positive .
the four police forces in wales are joining forces for the campaign .
dyfed-powys acting chief constable andy edwards said : " in the summer many people take advantage to have parties and barbecues especially when the sun is shining .
" however , as these events may take place over a number of hours they may lose track of how much they have had to drink .

3ks engineering has begun work on a contract worth £ 1m to build the panels which will open and close the retractable roof .
each of the 28 panels weighs 16 tonnes , and all 60 members of staff at the company have been working around the clock to meet the project deadline .
the retractable roof will be in place for next year 's wimbledon .
centre court at wimbledon has recently been extensively redeveloped , and this year 's competition will see both players and spectators left open to the elements .
the company won the contract because it is the only one in the uk where the panels could be fabricated , machined and assembled on one site .
' large components ' the panels are expected to leave llanelli in november under police escort .
a company spokesman said he thought the contract would help to bring in more work .
" we do a lot of offshore work anyway for the ministry of defence so we have the systems in place to compete with the big companies , " he said .

the slovak wildlife society 's -lrb- sws -rrb- work with mammals , such as wolves and bears , has attracted interest from highlands estate owner paul lister .
the society is also to work collaboratively this summer with the wildlife conservation research unit headed by scot , david macdonald .
sws hopes the planned centre would help rehabilitate sick and injured mammals .
robin rigg , of the anglo-slovak organisation , said the sanctuary could provide care for abandoned european brown bear cubs and lynx with minimal human contact .
bear-proof bins he said : " the aim would be to release them back into the wild .
" another part of the sanctuary would have individual animals not able to be released and could be seen by people and help educate them on the country 's wildlife . "
mr rigg 's brother alex , an artist based near thornhill , dumfries , has helped to run educational projects on wild animals for schools in slovakia .
sws has a specific scheme , called the bears project , which is attempting to help people better understand the animals .
it has been also promoted the use of bear-proof bins from north america and safe use of electric fencing to protect properties without harming the creatures .
professor macdonald , who heads university of oxford 's wildlife conservation research unit , confirmed members of sws would be working with his team over the summer .
he has previously visited the society in slovakia .
mr lister , who owns the alladale wilderness reserve north of inverness , has also been a visitor .
he is keen to see wolves and other animals once native to scotland reintroduced .

the slovak wildlife society 's -lrb- sws -rrb- work with mammals , such as wolves and bears , has attracted interest from highlands estate owner paul lister .
the society is also to work collaboratively this summer with the wildlife conservation research unit headed by scot , david macdonald .
sws hopes the planned centre would help rehabilitate sick and injured mammals .
robin rigg , of the anglo-slovak organisation , said the sanctuary could provide care for abandoned european brown bear cubs and lynx with minimal human contact .
bear-proof bins he said : " the aim would be to release them back into the wild .
" another part of the sanctuary would have individual animals not able to be released and could be seen by people and help educate them on the country 's wildlife . "
mr rigg 's brother alex , an artist based near thornhill , dumfries , has helped to run educational projects on wild animals for schools in slovakia .
sws has a specific scheme , called the bears project , which is attempting to help people better understand the animals .
it has been also promoted the use of bear-proof bins from north america and safe use of electric fencing to protect properties without harming the creatures .
professor macdonald , who heads university of oxford 's wildlife conservation research unit , confirmed members of sws would be working with his team over the summer .
he has previously visited the society in slovakia .
mr lister , who owns the alladale wilderness reserve north of inverness , has also been a visitor .
he is keen to see wolves and other animals once native to scotland reintroduced .

picture : lloyd bishop in the last in a series on the use of technology in the highlands and islands , the bbc scotland news website looks at broadband .
it has brought star wars stormtroopers , graphic novel artists and writers to the north for the highlands ' first comic book convention .
and made it possible for work of an inverness fashion designer to be seen in all its glory on the web .
broadband along with advances in communications technology have opened the highlands and islands to the rest of the world at a click of a mouse .
but the roll-out of faster internet speeds has not been without problems .
one woman for whom the web has been a major boost is inverness designer sandra murray .
her work has been draped on models posing against the backdrops of a new york city skyline and dramatic landscapes of the scottish highlands .
while she can not ever rule out the value of face-to-face meetings with buyers and those who provide her with the raw materials , she said a website dedicated to her designs has helped raise her profile .
she said : " it is definitely a shop window for me .
" i have n't put products up for sale on the website but that might come . "
ms murray said one handbag designer 's online sales now out strip those of her flagship shop .
practically the entire event was organised through e-mail - from sending invitations to guests to booking hotel rooms and flights for them richmond clements hiex organiser ms murray said : " it just shows people are so busy and time-short they ca n't walk round the corner to the shops . "
however , amid the drive towards new technology , ms murray said fashionistas were hankering for traditional materials .
she said : " i think one of the best things i have ever done is a photo shoot in the hebrides which are shown on the website .
" it shows the place but also because luxury is being redefined a lot of people want heritage and history attached to their clothes .
" they want something to trace back , such as to harris tweed , or lochcarron .
" when i did an event with the national trust for scotland in new york i had five models wearing five garments all in scottish fabric .
" these were 5ft 11in , very glamorous girls in the metropolitan club , which is quite a grand place , and the models were going around telling people about the clothing . "
star wars and debates on which actor was the best batman and the explosion in popularity of japanese manga comics could not be further removed from statuesque fashion models strutting their stuff in the big apple .
but ms murray 's art and hiex - the highlands ' first comic book convention - are loosely connected by their use of the internet to reach the wider world .
richmond clements , one of the convention organisers , said without communications technology the event would not have happened .
he said : " practically the entire event was organised through e-mail - from sending invitations to guests to booking hotel rooms and flights for them .
" our website , which was kindly built for us by one of the guests , author michael carroll , was at the forefront of the publicity drive to promote the event .
" mike had previously organised the irish national sci-fi con , octocon , so as well as providing excellent advice and experience , he also gifted us with another splendid thing .
" he had written a computer program to help organise the weekend . "
the cover of futurequake comic which mr clements is involved with the introduction of faster internet connection speeds in the region had some hitches .
connected communities , a publicly-funded scheme to bring wireless broadband on the western isles , has met with fierce opposition on barra .
residents have argued money would be better spent upgrading telephone exchanges for bt to provide cheaper and faster internet services .
earlier this year , highlands and islands enterprise -lrb- hie -rrb- said it was dealing with a number of objections and complaints .
work to deliver broadband internet connections across the rest of the highlands and islands was also dogged by delays and extra expense .
in november , a highland council report said the £ 70m flagship government project , pathfinder north , to provide faster services was six months behind schedule and £ 1.6m over budget .
the project is being rolled out in argyll and bute , moray , orkney , shetland and the western isles .
the previous scottish executive administration committed more than £ 60m to pathfinder north .
meanwhile , the larger than life adventures of comic book stories are being transformed by technology .
mr clements said : " i 'm part of the editorial team on the comic futurequake , and we could not function without the internet .
" there are three of us involved in putting the book out , and we live in birmingham , cardiff and me in the highlands . "
he added : " some artists have abandoned paper altogether .
the most famous and notable artists to do so is brian bolland .
" he is renowned for his brilliantly precise line work .
what is amazing though is that after moving to purely digital drawing , his style never changed at all .
" it still looks as detailed and realistic as it always did . "
