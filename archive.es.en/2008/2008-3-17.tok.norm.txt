" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .
the 11-member tribunal has to approve court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment against the akp before a court case can begin .
a final verdict is not expected for several months .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .

tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .

" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .
" the images of what 's happening in lhasa belong out there in the world . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 400 nato-led kfor peacekeepers had been sent to the northern , serb-dominated section of mitrovica as un police and civilian officials were ordered out in a situation evaluated as too dangerous for non-military personnel .
un chief ban ki-moon deplored the violent attacks against un and nato-led forces and urged " all communities to exercise calm and restraint . "
he expected " all sides to refrain from any actions or statements that could incite or provoke further violence , " a statement from his office said .
" time for maturity " in the capital pristina , prime minister hashim thaci vowed to maintain control over kosovo , which declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
serbia considers kosovo 's secession illegal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci called for calm and maturity " we are responsible and are determined to defend law and order , but most of all the territorial integrity of kosovo , " thaci said after meeting the european union envoy to kosovo , pieter feith .
" now it 's time for maturity , calm and common responsibility . "
rioting lasted some six hours , from early morning until around noon , during which shots were occasionally heard .
kfor said in the early afternoon that it has imposed control over northern mitrovica and established checkpoints around it and helicopters hovered above .
a river divides mitrovica between a kosovar albanian-dominated section in the south and the northern part , which is the hub of the largest serb enclave in kosovo .
police spokesman besim hoti said 25 united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- police officers were injured .
kfor spokesman etienne du fayet said eight peacekeepers were injured .
" we received a couple of hits by firearms , molotov cocktails and even hand grenades .
those ... were fired towards kfor and injured our soldiers , " du fayet told news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un police protect the court compound during clashes kosovo serbian medical sources said they treated nearly 80 protesters , two of whom sustained life-threatening injuries .
the deputy head of unmik , larry rossin , and kfor commander general xavier bout de marnhac condemned " the resort to lethal violence , including direct fire , taken by a mob . "
resorting to violence " crosses one of the red lines that have been clearly articulated to the leaders of kosovo serbs in the north and to officials in belgrade , " they said .
belgrade nationalists encouraged violence but violence in northern kosovo , the largest serb enclave with parallel structures of authority endorsed by serbia , has simmered each day since kosovo declared independence a month ago .
the 120,000 serbs who live in kosovo along with 2 million ethnic albanians reject the feb .
17 declaration of independence from serbia .
belgrade has said it will never accept kosovar statehood .
at least encouraged by belgrade leaders , including outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica and his hawkish kosovo minister slobodan samardzic , serbs have protested daily in northern kosovo and occasionally resorted to violence .
" activities that the serbs undertake ... which sometimes include elements of low-level violence , are a product of kosovo 's illegal declaration of independence , " samardzic said .
after a spate of violent incidents last month , when serbs set un vehicles and border checkpoints on fire , samardzic justified the attacks as a " legitimate " reaction to kosovo 's split from serbia .
kosovo tensions set to continue while pristina is desperate to keep the northern fifth of kosovo under control , belgrade wants to strengthen the de facto partition along ethnic lines by keeping both the albanian-dominated government and the international presence out .
without security forces of its own , pristina relies on un and kfor to impose laws north of river ibar , in the serb-dominated fifth of the country .
officials welcomed the raid on the mitrovica courthouse .
" we asked un and kfor from the start of the crisis to restore law and order and protect kosovo 's institutions , " deputy premier hajredin kuci told dpa . " the un mission in kosovo and kfor should deploy its entire force and authority in all parts of kosovo . "
in a statement monday afternoon , however , kostunica said he " sharply condemns the use of force against serbs who resist the establishment of a false state -lrb- kosovo -rrb- on serbia 's soil . "
with parliamentary polls in serbia scheduled for may 11 , tensions and potential for violence are certain to persist in northern kosovo , as the receding province provides ammunition for the nationalist rhetoric in belgrade .
" i would like at this point to urge everybody in kosovo to remain calm , to show restraint , and think of the future , " eu envoy feith told reporters in pristina . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 400 nato-led kfor peacekeepers had been sent to the northern , serb-dominated section of mitrovica as un police and civilian officials were ordered out in a situation evaluated as too dangerous for non-military personnel .
un chief ban ki-moon deplored the violent attacks against un and nato-led forces and urged " all communities to exercise calm and restraint . "
he expected " all sides to refrain from any actions or statements that could incite or provoke further violence , " a statement from his office said .
" time for maturity " in the capital pristina , prime minister hashim thaci vowed to maintain control over kosovo , which declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
serbia considers kosovo 's secession illegal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci called for calm and maturity " we are responsible and are determined to defend law and order , but most of all the territorial integrity of kosovo , " thaci said after meeting the european union envoy to kosovo , pieter feith .
" now it 's time for maturity , calm and common responsibility . "
rioting lasted some six hours , from early morning until around noon , during which shots were occasionally heard .
kfor said in the early afternoon that it has imposed control over northern mitrovica and established checkpoints around it and helicopters hovered above .
a river divides mitrovica between a kosovar albanian-dominated section in the south and the northern part , which is the hub of the largest serb enclave in kosovo .
police spokesman besim hoti said 25 united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- police officers were injured .
kfor spokesman etienne du fayet said eight peacekeepers were injured .
" we received a couple of hits by firearms , molotov cocktails and even hand grenades .
those ... were fired towards kfor and injured our soldiers , " du fayet told news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un police protect the court compound during clashes kosovo serbian medical sources said they treated nearly 80 protesters , two of whom sustained life-threatening injuries .
the deputy head of unmik , larry rossin , and kfor commander general xavier bout de marnhac condemned " the resort to lethal violence , including direct fire , taken by a mob . "
resorting to violence " crosses one of the red lines that have been clearly articulated to the leaders of kosovo serbs in the north and to officials in belgrade , " they said .
belgrade nationalists encouraged violence but violence in northern kosovo , the largest serb enclave with parallel structures of authority endorsed by serbia , has simmered each day since kosovo declared independence a month ago .
the 120,000 serbs who live in kosovo along with 2 million ethnic albanians reject the feb .
17 declaration of independence from serbia .
belgrade has said it will never accept kosovar statehood .
at least encouraged by belgrade leaders , including outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica and his hawkish kosovo minister slobodan samardzic , serbs have protested daily in northern kosovo and occasionally resorted to violence .
" activities that the serbs undertake ... which sometimes include elements of low-level violence , are a product of kosovo 's illegal declaration of independence , " samardzic said .
after a spate of violent incidents last month , when serbs set un vehicles and border checkpoints on fire , samardzic justified the attacks as a " legitimate " reaction to kosovo 's split from serbia .
kosovo tensions set to continue while pristina is desperate to keep the northern fifth of kosovo under control , belgrade wants to strengthen the de facto partition along ethnic lines by keeping both the albanian-dominated government and the international presence out .
without security forces of its own , pristina relies on un and kfor to impose laws north of river ibar , in the serb-dominated fifth of the country .
officials welcomed the raid on the mitrovica courthouse .
" we asked un and kfor from the start of the crisis to restore law and order and protect kosovo 's institutions , " deputy premier hajredin kuci told dpa . " the un mission in kosovo and kfor should deploy its entire force and authority in all parts of kosovo . "
in a statement monday afternoon , however , kostunica said he " sharply condemns the use of force against serbs who resist the establishment of a false state -lrb- kosovo -rrb- on serbia 's soil . "
with parliamentary polls in serbia scheduled for may 11 , tensions and potential for violence are certain to persist in northern kosovo , as the receding province provides ammunition for the nationalist rhetoric in belgrade .
" i would like at this point to urge everybody in kosovo to remain calm , to show restraint , and think of the future , " eu envoy feith told reporters in pristina . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.03.2008 high times for german vintners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us imports of german wine have trebled since 2002 , despite the weak dollar from new york to oslo and moscow to tokyo , german wine is in greater demand than ever - in the upper price categories above all . german vintners had one of their best years ever in 2007 , with global sales of 635 million euros -lrb- $ 990 million -rrb- in riesling , mueller-thurgau and silvaner .
the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .

american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .

over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .

" the international outraged at the suffering in tibet and the demonstrations at chinese embassies around the world will never influence leaders in beijing .
by cruelly suppressing the revolt , the chinese regime is making a calculated risk … china is a colossus which other nations handle with velvet gloves .
western governments will continue to give the upper hand to realpolitik over humanitarian solidarity . "
the zurich-based neue zuercher zeitung wrote that while the world 's indignation about the crisis in tibet is " understandable and correct , " it is not necessarily productive .
western leaders need to be much more assertive with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government realizes its reputation is on the line " sporadic indignation and hasty kowtowing before dictators and their wishes does not create respect for democracy in china .
those people that do n't possess the backbone to defend their own values and convictions are not respected in china . "
the german leipziger volkszeitung came out against a boycott , which it called a " demonstration of powerlessness " on the part of the west .
" if sports are supposed to play the world 's moral authority , the policy has failed , " the paper commented .
" neither the united nations , the us or the european union has convinced the ruling powers in beijing to solve the tibet problem without using force .
as moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 have shown , boycotts harm only the athletes and are politically ineffective . "
the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that while a boycott is not an ideal way of dealing with china , governments might be left with no other choice .
" at the moment , a boycott of the olympics would not seem to be the most effective , " the paper opined .
" but how china reacts in relation to the unrest will be of crucial importance .
a bloodbath in tibet would make it impossible to take part in a peaceful sports rivalry in beijing . "
the dutch newspaper de volkskrant wrote that a boycott of the summer olympics would send the wrong signal .
china knows that it has a lot at stake , the newspaper wrote in an editorial monday , and will do what it takes to avoid damaging its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china sees the olympics as an important publicity event “ the chinese rulers are faced with a big dilemma , " the daily said .
" a clampdown , which would cause a lot of bloodshed , brings with it the risk of substantially damaging its reputation . "
the conservative vienna newspaper die presse opposed a boycott , pointing out that the dalai lama had also spoken out against it .
" -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- said china has earned the games , yet it 's the international community 's ' moral responsibility ' to remind the chinese leaders that they must be a respectable host .
that may sound wimpy , but the wise religious leader is right .
a boycott does n't make sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : independence demonstrations turn violent in tibet olympic torch starts journey to beijing , despite disruptions germany calls on china to open up on tibet expert believes west can do little to sway china over tibet germany suspends aid talks with china over tibet violence human rights -pipe- 17.03.2008 eu opposes boycott of beijing olympics as tibet unrest escalates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tibetan capital lhasa has been rocked by violence the european union is opposed to a boycott of the beijing olympic games over china 's crackdown on pro-independence protests in tibet amid mounting fears the violence may end up hurting sports . the eu 's slovenian presidency said on monday , march 17 that the bloc remained firmly opposed to boycotting the olympic games in beijing in august in the wake of china 's bloody repression of protests in tibet that have left several people dead and injured scores .
a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tibetan cause has a lot of support in europe the chinese government should react positively to the dalai lama 's refusal to call for a boycott of the olympics and start “ dealing seriously with tibetan grievances , ” said the british newspaper the financial times on monday . " the dalai lama condemned what he called china 's ' rule of ­ terror ' and ' cultural genocide ' in tibet .
but he refrained from joining calls for a boycott of the beijing olympic games in august .
in the current violent circumstances , that is an olive branch , and chinese leaders should grasp it . "
the german rheinische post said countries should be forceful in their condemnations of china .
" china is ... a brutal regime which suppresses , locks up and kills dissenters , " the dusseldorf-based daily wrote .
" blood is on the hands of the ruling leaders , even if they long ago exchanged mao for tailored suits .
china wants to present itself to the world as a modern government that is on its way to becoming the second world power after the usa .
an olympic boycott would burst this dream .
if the pressure of the world community does not immediately stop the blood from pouring in tibet , then the youth of the world should not decamp to beijing .
it would be despicable to step over the dead bodies of tibetans in order to summon the cheerful spirit of the games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around europe munich 's sueddeutsche zeitung said that sponsors are slowly beginning to ask themselves whether the publicity is worth the damage to their brand names .
" it 's time to remind the communists in beijing that they need to remember that the olympic games do not only mean billions of advertising dollars and building contracts for the sons of party elites , but also require responsibility .
when the government invites millions of people to a peaceful celebration in the capital , it can not be simultaneously swinging clubs in lhasa and arresting more dissenters .

negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .

" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .

" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .
the 11-member tribunal has to approve court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment against the akp before a court case can begin .
a final verdict is not expected for several months .
a blow to turkey 's eu aspirations berlin shares the view of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who warned saturday that " the legal system should n't meddle in democratic politics . "

" there are people with nationalist sentiments and they are upset about turkey 's march towards the eu .
they are trying to reverse this but this is against the founding philosophy of the republic , which is a march towards the west , " celik said .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 17.03.2008 germany criticizes turkish party ban as undemocratic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey could be headed for a political crisis the german government sharply criticized a turkish prosecutor 's attempt to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for anti-secular activities , saying it will undermine turkey 's efforts to join to join the eu . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday , march 17 that he could not understand the chief proescutor 's ruling .
steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .
ban decision not final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more hurdle to joining the eu ?
" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .
the 11-member tribunal has to approve court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment against the akp before a court case can begin .
a final verdict is not expected for several months .
a blow to turkey 's eu aspirations berlin shares the view of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who warned saturday that " the legal system should n't meddle in democratic politics . "
turkish labor minister faruk celik told reuters that the entire case was a bid by nationalists inside the judiciary to try and block turkey 's eu membership bid .
" there are people with nationalist sentiments and they are upset about turkey 's march towards the eu .
they are trying to reverse this but this is against the founding philosophy of the republic , which is a march towards the west , " celik said .
turkey 's eu bid already faces opposition from many current members .
german chancellor angela merkel opposes turkey 's bid to join the eu although her left-right coalition government formally supports ankara 's ongoing membership talks with the bloc .
there are some 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany , most of them descendants of " guest workers " who came to the country in the 1960s . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 17.03.2008 germany criticizes turkish party ban as undemocratic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey could be headed for a political crisis the german government sharply criticized a turkish prosecutor 's attempt to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for anti-secular activities , saying it will undermine turkey 's efforts to join to join the eu . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday , march 17 that he could not understand the chief proescutor 's ruling .
steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .
ban decision not final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more hurdle to joining the eu ?
" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : independence demonstrations turn violent in tibet olympic torch starts journey to beijing , despite disruptions germany calls on china to open up on tibet expert believes west can do little to sway china over tibet germany suspends aid talks with china over tibet violence asia -pipe- 17.03.2008 european press review : turning up pressure on china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nepalese police officers snatch a tibetan flag from a tibetan protester in kathmandu while european newspaper editorials condemned the chinese government 's violent response to the uprising in tibet , there was disagreement on whether to boycott the upcoming olympic games in beijing this summer . the chinese government is convinced that it can violently suppress the uprising in tibet without facing any real consequences from the rest of the world , and it 's probably right , said the rome daily la repubblica .
" the international outraged at the suffering in tibet and the demonstrations at chinese embassies around the world will never influence leaders in beijing .
by cruelly suppressing the revolt , the chinese regime is making a calculated risk … china is a colossus which other nations handle with velvet gloves .
western governments will continue to give the upper hand to realpolitik over humanitarian solidarity . "
the zurich-based neue zuercher zeitung wrote that while the world 's indignation about the crisis in tibet is " understandable and correct , " it is not necessarily productive .
western leaders need to be much more assertive with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government realizes its reputation is on the line " sporadic indignation and hasty kowtowing before dictators and their wishes does not create respect for democracy in china .
those people that do n't possess the backbone to defend their own values and convictions are not respected in china . "
the german leipziger volkszeitung came out against a boycott , which it called a " demonstration of powerlessness " on the part of the west .
" if sports are supposed to play the world 's moral authority , the policy has failed , " the paper commented .
" neither the united nations , the us or the european union has convinced the ruling powers in beijing to solve the tibet problem without using force .
as moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 have shown , boycotts harm only the athletes and are politically ineffective . "
the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that while a boycott is not an ideal way of dealing with china , governments might be left with no other choice .
" at the moment , a boycott of the olympics would not seem to be the most effective , " the paper opined .
" but how china reacts in relation to the unrest will be of crucial importance .
a bloodbath in tibet would make it impossible to take part in a peaceful sports rivalry in beijing . "
the dutch newspaper de volkskrant wrote that a boycott of the summer olympics would send the wrong signal .
china knows that it has a lot at stake , the newspaper wrote in an editorial monday , and will do what it takes to avoid damaging its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china sees the olympics as an important publicity event “ the chinese rulers are faced with a big dilemma , " the daily said .
" a clampdown , which would cause a lot of bloodshed , brings with it the risk of substantially damaging its reputation . "
the conservative vienna newspaper die presse opposed a boycott , pointing out that the dalai lama had also spoken out against it .
" -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- said china has earned the games , yet it 's the international community 's ' moral responsibility ' to remind the chinese leaders that they must be a respectable host .
that may sound wimpy , but the wise religious leader is right .
a boycott does n't make sense .
the ' youth of the world ' will be travelling to beijing ...
the chinese government should be told that its behavior until now in relation to its own ethnic and religious minorities is simply unworthy of a large nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tibetan cause has a lot of support in europe the chinese government should react positively to the dalai lama 's refusal to call for a boycott of the olympics and start “ dealing seriously with tibetan grievances , ” said the british newspaper the financial times on monday . " the dalai lama condemned what he called china 's ' rule of ­ terror ' and ' cultural genocide ' in tibet .
but he refrained from joining calls for a boycott of the beijing olympic games in august .
in the current violent circumstances , that is an olive branch , and chinese leaders should grasp it . "
the german rheinische post said countries should be forceful in their condemnations of china .
" china is ... a brutal regime which suppresses , locks up and kills dissenters , " the dusseldorf-based daily wrote .
" blood is on the hands of the ruling leaders , even if they long ago exchanged mao for tailored suits .
china wants to present itself to the world as a modern government that is on its way to becoming the second world power after the usa .
an olympic boycott would burst this dream .
if the pressure of the world community does not immediately stop the blood from pouring in tibet , then the youth of the world should not decamp to beijing .
it would be despicable to step over the dead bodies of tibetans in order to summon the cheerful spirit of the games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around europe munich 's sueddeutsche zeitung said that sponsors are slowly beginning to ask themselves whether the publicity is worth the damage to their brand names .
" it 's time to remind the communists in beijing that they need to remember that the olympic games do not only mean billions of advertising dollars and building contracts for the sons of party elites , but also require responsibility .
when the government invites millions of people to a peaceful celebration in the capital , it can not be simultaneously swinging clubs in lhasa and arresting more dissenters .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

" the international outraged at the suffering in tibet and the demonstrations at chinese embassies around the world will never influence leaders in beijing .
by cruelly suppressing the revolt , the chinese regime is making a calculated risk … china is a colossus which other nations handle with velvet gloves .
western governments will continue to give the upper hand to realpolitik over humanitarian solidarity . "
the zurich-based neue zuercher zeitung wrote that while the world 's indignation about the crisis in tibet is " understandable and correct , " it is not necessarily productive .
western leaders need to be much more assertive with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government realizes its reputation is on the line " sporadic indignation and hasty kowtowing before dictators and their wishes does not create respect for democracy in china .
those people that do n't possess the backbone to defend their own values and convictions are not respected in china . "
the german leipziger volkszeitung came out against a boycott , which it called a " demonstration of powerlessness " on the part of the west .
" if sports are supposed to play the world 's moral authority , the policy has failed , " the paper commented .
" neither the united nations , the us or the european union has convinced the ruling powers in beijing to solve the tibet problem without using force .
as moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 have shown , boycotts harm only the athletes and are politically ineffective . "
the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that while a boycott is not an ideal way of dealing with china , governments might be left with no other choice .
" at the moment , a boycott of the olympics would not seem to be the most effective , " the paper opined .
" but how china reacts in relation to the unrest will be of crucial importance .
a bloodbath in tibet would make it impossible to take part in a peaceful sports rivalry in beijing . "
the dutch newspaper de volkskrant wrote that a boycott of the summer olympics would send the wrong signal .
china knows that it has a lot at stake , the newspaper wrote in an editorial monday , and will do what it takes to avoid damaging its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china sees the olympics as an important publicity event “ the chinese rulers are faced with a big dilemma , " the daily said .
" a clampdown , which would cause a lot of bloodshed , brings with it the risk of substantially damaging its reputation . "
the conservative vienna newspaper die presse opposed a boycott , pointing out that the dalai lama had also spoken out against it .
" -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- said china has earned the games , yet it 's the international community 's ' moral responsibility ' to remind the chinese leaders that they must be a respectable host .
that may sound wimpy , but the wise religious leader is right .
a boycott does n't make sense .
the ' youth of the world ' will be travelling to beijing ...
the chinese government should be told that its behavior until now in relation to its own ethnic and religious minorities is simply unworthy of a large nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tibetan cause has a lot of support in europe the chinese government should react positively to the dalai lama 's refusal to call for a boycott of the olympics and start “ dealing seriously with tibetan grievances , ” said the british newspaper the financial times on monday . " the dalai lama condemned what he called china 's ' rule of ­ terror ' and ' cultural genocide ' in tibet .
but he refrained from joining calls for a boycott of the beijing olympic games in august .
in the current violent circumstances , that is an olive branch , and chinese leaders should grasp it . "
the german rheinische post said countries should be forceful in their condemnations of china .
" china is ... a brutal regime which suppresses , locks up and kills dissenters , " the dusseldorf-based daily wrote .
" blood is on the hands of the ruling leaders , even if they long ago exchanged mao for tailored suits .
china wants to present itself to the world as a modern government that is on its way to becoming the second world power after the usa .
an olympic boycott would burst this dream .
if the pressure of the world community does not immediately stop the blood from pouring in tibet , then the youth of the world should not decamp to beijing .
it would be despicable to step over the dead bodies of tibetans in order to summon the cheerful spirit of the games . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators took to the streets around europe munich 's sueddeutsche zeitung said that sponsors are slowly beginning to ask themselves whether the publicity is worth the damage to their brand names .
" it 's time to remind the communists in beijing that they need to remember that the olympic games do not only mean billions of advertising dollars and building contracts for the sons of party elites , but also require responsibility .
when the government invites millions of people to a peaceful celebration in the capital , it can not be simultaneously swinging clubs in lhasa and arresting more dissenters .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .

"
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .

" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .

" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 400 nato-led kfor peacekeepers had been sent to the northern , serb-dominated section of mitrovica as un police and civilian officials were ordered out in a situation evaluated as too dangerous for non-military personnel .
un chief ban ki-moon deplored the violent attacks against un and nato-led forces and urged " all communities to exercise calm and restraint . "
he expected " all sides to refrain from any actions or statements that could incite or provoke further violence , " a statement from his office said .
" time for maturity " in the capital pristina , prime minister hashim thaci vowed to maintain control over kosovo , which declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
serbia considers kosovo 's secession illegal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci called for calm and maturity " we are responsible and are determined to defend law and order , but most of all the territorial integrity of kosovo , " thaci said after meeting the european union envoy to kosovo , pieter feith .
" now it 's time for maturity , calm and common responsibility . "
rioting lasted some six hours , from early morning until around noon , during which shots were occasionally heard .
kfor said in the early afternoon that it has imposed control over northern mitrovica and established checkpoints around it and helicopters hovered above .
a river divides mitrovica between a kosovar albanian-dominated section in the south and the northern part , which is the hub of the largest serb enclave in kosovo .
police spokesman besim hoti said 25 united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- police officers were injured .
kfor spokesman etienne du fayet said eight peacekeepers were injured .
" we received a couple of hits by firearms , molotov cocktails and even hand grenades .
those ... were fired towards kfor and injured our soldiers , " du fayet told news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un police protect the court compound during clashes kosovo serbian medical sources said they treated nearly 80 protesters , two of whom sustained life-threatening injuries .
the deputy head of unmik , larry rossin , and kfor commander general xavier bout de marnhac condemned " the resort to lethal violence , including direct fire , taken by a mob . "
resorting to violence " crosses one of the red lines that have been clearly articulated to the leaders of kosovo serbs in the north and to officials in belgrade , " they said .
belgrade nationalists encouraged violence but violence in northern kosovo , the largest serb enclave with parallel structures of authority endorsed by serbia , has simmered each day since kosovo declared independence a month ago .
the 120,000 serbs who live in kosovo along with 2 million ethnic albanians reject the feb .
17 declaration of independence from serbia .
belgrade has said it will never accept kosovar statehood .
at least encouraged by belgrade leaders , including outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica and his hawkish kosovo minister slobodan samardzic , serbs have protested daily in northern kosovo and occasionally resorted to violence .
" activities that the serbs undertake ... which sometimes include elements of low-level violence , are a product of kosovo 's illegal declaration of independence , " samardzic said .
after a spate of violent incidents last month , when serbs set un vehicles and border checkpoints on fire , samardzic justified the attacks as a " legitimate " reaction to kosovo 's split from serbia .
kosovo tensions set to continue while pristina is desperate to keep the northern fifth of kosovo under control , belgrade wants to strengthen the de facto partition along ethnic lines by keeping both the albanian-dominated government and the international presence out .
without security forces of its own , pristina relies on un and kfor to impose laws north of river ibar , in the serb-dominated fifth of the country .
officials welcomed the raid on the mitrovica courthouse .
" we asked un and kfor from the start of the crisis to restore law and order and protect kosovo 's institutions , " deputy premier hajredin kuci told dpa . " the un mission in kosovo and kfor should deploy its entire force and authority in all parts of kosovo . "
in a statement monday afternoon , however , kostunica said he " sharply condemns the use of force against serbs who resist the establishment of a false state -lrb- kosovo -rrb- on serbia 's soil . "
with parliamentary polls in serbia scheduled for may 11 , tensions and potential for violence are certain to persist in northern kosovo , as the receding province provides ammunition for the nationalist rhetoric in belgrade .
" i would like at this point to urge everybody in kosovo to remain calm , to show restraint , and think of the future , " eu envoy feith told reporters in pristina . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 400 nato-led kfor peacekeepers had been sent to the northern , serb-dominated section of mitrovica as un police and civilian officials were ordered out in a situation evaluated as too dangerous for non-military personnel .
un chief ban ki-moon deplored the violent attacks against un and nato-led forces and urged " all communities to exercise calm and restraint . "
he expected " all sides to refrain from any actions or statements that could incite or provoke further violence , " a statement from his office said .
" time for maturity " in the capital pristina , prime minister hashim thaci vowed to maintain control over kosovo , which declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
serbia considers kosovo 's secession illegal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci called for calm and maturity " we are responsible and are determined to defend law and order , but most of all the territorial integrity of kosovo , " thaci said after meeting the european union envoy to kosovo , pieter feith .
" now it 's time for maturity , calm and common responsibility . "
rioting lasted some six hours , from early morning until around noon , during which shots were occasionally heard .
kfor said in the early afternoon that it has imposed control over northern mitrovica and established checkpoints around it and helicopters hovered above .
a river divides mitrovica between a kosovar albanian-dominated section in the south and the northern part , which is the hub of the largest serb enclave in kosovo .
police spokesman besim hoti said 25 united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- police officers were injured .
kfor spokesman etienne du fayet said eight peacekeepers were injured .
" we received a couple of hits by firearms , molotov cocktails and even hand grenades .
those ... were fired towards kfor and injured our soldiers , " du fayet told news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un police protect the court compound during clashes kosovo serbian medical sources said they treated nearly 80 protesters , two of whom sustained life-threatening injuries .
the deputy head of unmik , larry rossin , and kfor commander general xavier bout de marnhac condemned " the resort to lethal violence , including direct fire , taken by a mob . "
resorting to violence " crosses one of the red lines that have been clearly articulated to the leaders of kosovo serbs in the north and to officials in belgrade , " they said .
belgrade nationalists encouraged violence but violence in northern kosovo , the largest serb enclave with parallel structures of authority endorsed by serbia , has simmered each day since kosovo declared independence a month ago .
the 120,000 serbs who live in kosovo along with 2 million ethnic albanians reject the feb .
17 declaration of independence from serbia .
belgrade has said it will never accept kosovar statehood .
at least encouraged by belgrade leaders , including outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica and his hawkish kosovo minister slobodan samardzic , serbs have protested daily in northern kosovo and occasionally resorted to violence .
" activities that the serbs undertake ... which sometimes include elements of low-level violence , are a product of kosovo 's illegal declaration of independence , " samardzic said .
after a spate of violent incidents last month , when serbs set un vehicles and border checkpoints on fire , samardzic justified the attacks as a " legitimate " reaction to kosovo 's split from serbia .
kosovo tensions set to continue while pristina is desperate to keep the northern fifth of kosovo under control , belgrade wants to strengthen the de facto partition along ethnic lines by keeping both the albanian-dominated government and the international presence out .
without security forces of its own , pristina relies on un and kfor to impose laws north of river ibar , in the serb-dominated fifth of the country .
officials welcomed the raid on the mitrovica courthouse .
" we asked un and kfor from the start of the crisis to restore law and order and protect kosovo 's institutions , " deputy premier hajredin kuci told dpa . " the un mission in kosovo and kfor should deploy its entire force and authority in all parts of kosovo . "
in a statement monday afternoon , however , kostunica said he " sharply condemns the use of force against serbs who resist the establishment of a false state -lrb- kosovo -rrb- on serbia 's soil . "
with parliamentary polls in serbia scheduled for may 11 , tensions and potential for violence are certain to persist in northern kosovo , as the receding province provides ammunition for the nationalist rhetoric in belgrade .
" i would like at this point to urge everybody in kosovo to remain calm , to show restraint , and think of the future , " eu envoy feith told reporters in pristina . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 17.03.2008 germany criticizes turkish party ban as undemocratic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey could be headed for a political crisis the german government sharply criticized a turkish prosecutor 's attempt to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for anti-secular activities , saying it will undermine turkey 's efforts to join to join the eu . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday , march 17 that he could not understand the chief proescutor 's ruling .
steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .
ban decision not final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more hurdle to joining the eu ?
" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .
the 11-member tribunal has to approve court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment against the akp before a court case can begin .
a final verdict is not expected for several months .
a blow to turkey 's eu aspirations berlin shares the view of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who warned saturday that " the legal system should n't meddle in democratic politics . "
turkish labor minister faruk celik told reuters that the entire case was a bid by nationalists inside the judiciary to try and block turkey 's eu membership bid .
" there are people with nationalist sentiments and they are upset about turkey 's march towards the eu .
they are trying to reverse this but this is against the founding philosophy of the republic , which is a march towards the west , " celik said .
turkey 's eu bid already faces opposition from many current members .
german chancellor angela merkel opposes turkey 's bid to join the eu although her left-right coalition government formally supports ankara 's ongoing membership talks with the bloc .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp .

there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.03.2008 high times for german vintners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us imports of german wine have trebled since 2002 , despite the weak dollar from new york to oslo and moscow to tokyo , german wine is in greater demand than ever - in the upper price categories above all . german vintners had one of their best years ever in 2007 , with global sales of 635 million euros -lrb- $ 990 million -rrb- in riesling , mueller-thurgau and silvaner .
the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .
" the images of what 's happening in lhasa belong out there in the world . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.03.2008 high times for german vintners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us imports of german wine have trebled since 2002 , despite the weak dollar from new york to oslo and moscow to tokyo , german wine is in greater demand than ever - in the upper price categories above all . german vintners had one of their best years ever in 2007 , with global sales of 635 million euros -lrb- $ 990 million -rrb- in riesling , mueller-thurgau and silvaner .
the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .

thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .

" the international outraged at the suffering in tibet and the demonstrations at chinese embassies around the world will never influence leaders in beijing .
by cruelly suppressing the revolt , the chinese regime is making a calculated risk … china is a colossus which other nations handle with velvet gloves .
western governments will continue to give the upper hand to realpolitik over humanitarian solidarity . "
the zurich-based neue zuercher zeitung wrote that while the world 's indignation about the crisis in tibet is " understandable and correct , " it is not necessarily productive .
western leaders need to be much more assertive with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government realizes its reputation is on the line " sporadic indignation and hasty kowtowing before dictators and their wishes does not create respect for democracy in china .
those people that do n't possess the backbone to defend their own values and convictions are not respected in china . "
the german leipziger volkszeitung came out against a boycott , which it called a " demonstration of powerlessness " on the part of the west .
" if sports are supposed to play the world 's moral authority , the policy has failed , " the paper commented .
" neither the united nations , the us or the european union has convinced the ruling powers in beijing to solve the tibet problem without using force .
as moscow in 1980 and los angeles in 1984 have shown , boycotts harm only the athletes and are politically ineffective . "
the conservative norwegian newspaper aftenposten said that while a boycott is not an ideal way of dealing with china , governments might be left with no other choice .
" at the moment , a boycott of the olympics would not seem to be the most effective , " the paper opined .
" but how china reacts in relation to the unrest will be of crucial importance .
a bloodbath in tibet would make it impossible to take part in a peaceful sports rivalry in beijing . "
the dutch newspaper de volkskrant wrote that a boycott of the summer olympics would send the wrong signal .
china knows that it has a lot at stake , the newspaper wrote in an editorial monday , and will do what it takes to avoid damaging its reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china sees the olympics as an important publicity event “ the chinese rulers are faced with a big dilemma , " the daily said .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.03.2008 high times for german vintners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us imports of german wine have trebled since 2002 , despite the weak dollar from new york to oslo and moscow to tokyo , german wine is in greater demand than ever - in the upper price categories above all . german vintners had one of their best years ever in 2007 , with global sales of 635 million euros -lrb- $ 990 million -rrb- in riesling , mueller-thurgau and silvaner .
the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .
but that could change . guenther birkenstock -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.03.2008 high times for german vintners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us imports of german wine have trebled since 2002 , despite the weak dollar from new york to oslo and moscow to tokyo , german wine is in greater demand than ever - in the upper price categories above all . german vintners had one of their best years ever in 2007 , with global sales of 635 million euros -lrb- $ 990 million -rrb- in riesling , mueller-thurgau and silvaner .
the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .
the 11-member tribunal has to approve court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment against the akp before a court case can begin .
a final verdict is not expected for several months .
a blow to turkey 's eu aspirations berlin shares the view of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who warned saturday that " the legal system should n't meddle in democratic politics . "
turkish labor minister faruk celik told reuters that the entire case was a bid by nationalists inside the judiciary to try and block turkey 's eu membership bid .
" there are people with nationalist sentiments and they are upset about turkey 's march towards the eu .
they are trying to reverse this but this is against the founding philosophy of the republic , which is a march towards the west , " celik said .
turkey 's eu bid already faces opposition from many current members .
german chancellor angela merkel opposes turkey 's bid to join the eu although her left-right coalition government formally supports ankara 's ongoing membership talks with the bloc .

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama has spoken of " cultural genocide " in tibet the turmoil has brought a wave of negative publicity for china ahead of its hosting of the olympics games and has sparked an international discussion about a boycott .
tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama on sunday condemned what he called china 's " rule of terror " and " cultural genocide " in tibet after reports of heavy casualties among protesters .
but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .

" this is an extraordinary , in many ways a historic occasion in relations between israel and germany , " israeli prime minister ehud olmert said .
israel becomes the sixth country - after france , italy , spain , poland and russia - with which germany will in future hold yearly intergovernmental meetings .
the two countries plan to step up bilateral cooperation in culture , science , economics and media .
there are plans to set up a german-israeli forum to promote exchanges of young people from both nations .
the israeli universities of haifa and jerusalem plan to set up centers for germany studies this year and the two countries ' armies intend to scale up training exchanges .
" a new chapter " earlier , a sombre-faced merkel turned up the eternal flame in the hall of remembrance at the yad vashem memorial before laying a wreath and pausing for several seconds of silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the yad vashem memorial dressed in a black suit , merkel - the first german chancellor born after world war ii - also visited the children 's memorial and signed the guestbook at the end of her third visit to yad vashem since taking office .
" in view of germany 's responsibility for the shoah -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , the german government ... underlines its determination to build a future together , " she said .
on sunday , merkel visited the grave and home of israel 's founder and first prime minister david ben gurion at the sde boker kibbutz in the heart of the negev desert in the south of the country .
on tuesday , merkel will become the first german chancellor to address the israeli parliament , the knesset , an honour normally reserved for heads of state .
" sixty years after the creation of israel we affirm again the special responsibility of germany towards israel , " merkel said at a lavish welcoming ceremony at tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
" but there is not only the responsibility for the past but projects for a better future , " she added .
" i am grateful we can open a new chapter in relations between our two countries , " she said .
welcoming merkel , olmert praised her " unflinching support " for the jewish state and described the german leader as a " strategic ally . "
on the eve of her three-day visit , merkel stressed germany 's continuing responsibility to israel .
merkel said she wanted " to show our responsibility for the past - the horrors of the shoah - and demonstrate clearly that israel 's right to existence is a constant in german foreign policy . "
more than 60 years since the holocaust , in which the nazis killed six million jews , germany is israel 's most important political and trading partner in europe .
merkel holds back with criticism merkel , who is under pressure from some politicians at home to raise controversial issues with olmert such as the building of jewish settlements in the west bank , remained cautious about the topic during talks with the israeli prime minister .
pointing out that actions by both the israelis and palestinians were hampering the peace process , merkel said : " the practical situation is more complicated than it appears from a distance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mideast conflict has been simmering for a long time olmert stressed israel will continue settlement construction in annexed east jerusalem .
" there are places that we will not give up as part of a final -lrb- peace -rrb- agreement and that is why there is no reason that we stop building there , " he said , alluding to large israeli settlement blocs in the west bank .
referring to the so-called roadmap for peace to end the mideast conflict , merkel said all sides " have to stick to the conditions as far as possible . "
she added that europeans too had responsibilities in solving the conflict .
" we should n't bite off more than we can chew .
but it would be wrong to close our eyes to the problem too , " she said .
germany is to host a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
dealing with iran iran remained high on the agenda during talks .
merkel underlined that she was in favour of a concerted common approach to dealing with tehran which the international community suspects of developing nuclear weapons .
the chancellor however stressed that germany would pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
earlier this year , germany joined the five permanent un security council members russia , united states , france , britain and china this year in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against iran , which the council approved this month . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a boycott would " greatly damage ' sport , " slovenian sports minister milan zver was quoted by the sta news agency as saying at the start of a meeting of eu sports ministers and eu national olympic committees at the brdo pri kranju castle , north of ljubljana zver added that he was also personally against the idea of a boycott , sta reported .
" i hope that sport is still an instrument for intercultural dialogue , " ' zver said , adding that discussion about a possible boycott would be ' hard to avoid ' at the eu meeting .
negative publicity violence has flared in tibet and neighboring provinces after five days of protests in lhasa , the tibetan capital , in what is seen as the greatest challenge to beijing 's authority in the region for nearly 20 years , when an uprising was brutally suppressed by authorities , rights groups have said .

but he refrained from calling for a boycott of the beijing olympics , as many tibetan exiles have been demanding .
" building bridges not walls " most european governments and sports officials have ruled out boycotting the games .
on monday , the german government reasserted it was opposed to a boycott .
german chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman said the government " explicitly did not share " calls to boycott the olympic games in beijing in august .
" the german government does n't support calls to boycott the olympics in beijing .
that would only affect athletes who have been preparing for years for the games , " thomas steg said in berlin .
" from the point of view of the chancellor , the problems in the region can only be resolved through a peaceful dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama , " steg said . he said germany " understands and supports the will for cultural and religious autonomy " among tibetans but also " the territorial integrity of china and everything that goes along with a ' one china ' policy . "
thomas bach , the german vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said a boycott would not solve the crisis .
" the more difficult a situation , the more important the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation associated with the olympics becomes , " bach said in an interview with german radio station , deutschlandfunk .
" the aim of the olympic games is to build bridges and not walls , " bach said .
he pointed out that boycotts had proved unsuccessful in the past .
the games were boycotted in 1980 in moscow and in los angeles in 1984 .
sport organizations are n't a world government and ca n't resolve problems " that a generation of un secretary-generals and heads of states have n't solved , " he said .
stepping up pressure however , some politicians have raised the possibility of using a boycott as a tool to step up pressure on china .
" dealing carefully with the people 's republic of china requires that you not completely rule out something like this -lrb- a boycott -rrb- , " roland koch , a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the premier of the state of hesse said on monday .
at the same time everyone should be clear that such a boycott would be the last thing the international community should resort to , " koch said .
koch , who has been a close friend of the dalai lama for years , also urged the chinese government to stop expelling journalists from tibet .
" diplomats and journalists must have immediate access to the tibetan region , " koch said .
" the images of what 's happening in lhasa belong out there in the world . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .

" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .
the 11-member tribunal has to approve court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment against the akp before a court case can begin .

some 400 nato-led kfor peacekeepers had been sent to the northern , serb-dominated section of mitrovica as un police and civilian officials were ordered out in a situation evaluated as too dangerous for non-military personnel .
un chief ban ki-moon deplored the violent attacks against un and nato-led forces and urged " all communities to exercise calm and restraint . "
he expected " all sides to refrain from any actions or statements that could incite or provoke further violence , " a statement from his office said .
" time for maturity " in the capital pristina , prime minister hashim thaci vowed to maintain control over kosovo , which declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
serbia considers kosovo 's secession illegal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci called for calm and maturity " we are responsible and are determined to defend law and order , but most of all the territorial integrity of kosovo , " thaci said after meeting the european union envoy to kosovo , pieter feith .
" now it 's time for maturity , calm and common responsibility . "
rioting lasted some six hours , from early morning until around noon , during which shots were occasionally heard .
kfor said in the early afternoon that it has imposed control over northern mitrovica and established checkpoints around it and helicopters hovered above .
a river divides mitrovica between a kosovar albanian-dominated section in the south and the northern part , which is the hub of the largest serb enclave in kosovo .
police spokesman besim hoti said 25 united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- police officers were injured .
kfor spokesman etienne du fayet said eight peacekeepers were injured .
" we received a couple of hits by firearms , molotov cocktails and even hand grenades .
those ... were fired towards kfor and injured our soldiers , " du fayet told news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un police protect the court compound during clashes kosovo serbian medical sources said they treated nearly 80 protesters , two of whom sustained life-threatening injuries .
the deputy head of unmik , larry rossin , and kfor commander general xavier bout de marnhac condemned " the resort to lethal violence , including direct fire , taken by a mob . "
resorting to violence " crosses one of the red lines that have been clearly articulated to the leaders of kosovo serbs in the north and to officials in belgrade , " they said .
belgrade nationalists encouraged violence but violence in northern kosovo , the largest serb enclave with parallel structures of authority endorsed by serbia , has simmered each day since kosovo declared independence a month ago .
the 120,000 serbs who live in kosovo along with 2 million ethnic albanians reject the feb .
17 declaration of independence from serbia .
belgrade has said it will never accept kosovar statehood .
at least encouraged by belgrade leaders , including outgoing prime minister vojislav kostunica and his hawkish kosovo minister slobodan samardzic , serbs have protested daily in northern kosovo and occasionally resorted to violence .
" activities that the serbs undertake ... which sometimes include elements of low-level violence , are a product of kosovo 's illegal declaration of independence , " samardzic said .
after a spate of violent incidents last month , when serbs set un vehicles and border checkpoints on fire , samardzic justified the attacks as a " legitimate " reaction to kosovo 's split from serbia .
kosovo tensions set to continue while pristina is desperate to keep the northern fifth of kosovo under control , belgrade wants to strengthen the de facto partition along ethnic lines by keeping both the albanian-dominated government and the international presence out .
without security forces of its own , pristina relies on un and kfor to impose laws north of river ibar , in the serb-dominated fifth of the country .
officials welcomed the raid on the mitrovica courthouse .
" we asked un and kfor from the start of the crisis to restore law and order and protect kosovo 's institutions , " deputy premier hajredin kuci told dpa . " the un mission in kosovo and kfor should deploy its entire force and authority in all parts of kosovo . "
in a statement monday afternoon , however , kostunica said he " sharply condemns the use of force against serbs who resist the establishment of a false state -lrb- kosovo -rrb- on serbia 's soil . "
with parliamentary polls in serbia scheduled for may 11 , tensions and potential for violence are certain to persist in northern kosovo , as the receding province provides ammunition for the nationalist rhetoric in belgrade .
" i would like at this point to urge everybody in kosovo to remain calm , to show restraint , and think of the future , " eu envoy feith told reporters in pristina . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british are the germans ' biggest customers , and they 're burying the cliche : instead of quaffing cheap , sweet " liebfrauenmilch , " they 're shelling out more money for german whites that are full of character , that is , wines whose flavor reflects the terroir in which they were grown . until recently , the french seemed to have copyrighted the term , which refers to the effect that local conditions - the quality of the earth , the angle of the sun , the microclimate - have on grapes .
but german vintners growing interest in these factors and their increased skill have led to more individuality in their wines .
nowadays , ever more german wines have unique flavors , such as riesling that tastes vaguely of slate or silvaner with a hint of limestone .
they offer a strong contrast to the mass of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon that come from all over the world and may taste nice , but are often interchangeable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german wines are no longer just for quaffing the us offers an example of german wine 's new popularity .
american companies imported 47 million euros in german wine in 2002 .
by 2007 the amount had trebled , despite the weakness of the dollar which had jacked up the price of european wine . popular on the home front german wine has also gained popularity at home .
over half of the money german consumers spent on wine last year went toward local bottles .
and in an upset to another cliche , germans spent more money on wine than they did on beer - for the seventh year in a row . that 's part of the reason dusseldorf 's " prowein " has evolved into europe 's most important wine and spirits trade fair .
although vinexpo in bordeaux and vinitaly in verona are more glamorous , ever more wine traders , sommeliers and vintners are coming to germany to pick up on the newest trends .
this year 3,000 exhibitors from four dozen countries are showing there , more than ever before . ready for a good year although they are n't yet ripe , professionals will get to taste the first german wines of 2007 at the fair , which runs until tuesday , march 18 .
despite the rainy summer in much of the country , it 's expected to be a good year , since a long growth period counts more for a nice wine than hot , sunny days do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grapes need a long time to ripen rather than hot temperatures an especially warm april led to a much earlier start for the grapes than normal .
each day gives them more time to develop flavor , so that a slower , cooler growth period results in a finer wine .
thus german vintners were able to harvest more and better grapes in 2007 . the bigger and better harvest has also made organic wine a greater topic at prowein this year .
in line with the boom in organic food , consumers have also taken an interest in organic wine , and the industry has responded .
long considered a recipe for mediocrity , the organic certificate has now become sign of quality , with vintners employing the techniques used to produce organic wines regardless of whether they have the certification or not .
however , the amount of certified organic wine still makes up only around 3 percent of germany 's total wine production , leaving plenty of opportunity for french and italian vintners to satisfy the growing demand .
but that could change . guenther birkenstock -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 17.03.2008 germany criticizes turkish party ban as undemocratic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey could be headed for a political crisis the german government sharply criticized a turkish prosecutor 's attempt to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- for anti-secular activities , saying it will undermine turkey 's efforts to join to join the eu . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday , march 17 that he could not understand the chief proescutor 's ruling .
steinmeier said the akp has shown itself to be committed to democracy and the rule of law and that he believes the court will ultimately reject the request to outlaw the party .
" i have taken noted of the banning application against the turkish ruling party , the akp , with incomprehension , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , adding that he had faith in turkey 's judiciary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier sharply criticized the proposed ban deputy government spokesman thomas steg said berlin was " worried " by the court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp friday , calling the move undemocratic .
turkey 's top court was reviewing yalcinkaya 's indictment of the akp on monday , which seeks to shut down the akp and ban many of turkey 's top politicians , including prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , from participating in politics for five years .
skirmish over secularism yalcinkaya 's move is the latest round in the battle between turkey 's secularist forces and the akp since the party came to power in 2002 .
analysts see the current fight as a clash between secularists and the more religious , conservative akp .
while anger has been simmering since the akp won snap elections last year , tensions flared last month when the akp pushed through a bill allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a culture clash turkey , a strictly secular country , is seeing a power shift away from secular urban elites to the more conservative , rural middle-class circles which supports the akp . " the system is resisting -lrb- the change -rrb- .
the polarization between the judiciary and the government is a major political crisis , " political expert nuray mert said in an interview published in the popular vatan daily monday .
" no one can know where it will end , " she said .
akp rejects islamist charges yalcinkaya 's indictment accuses the akp , which emerged from a banned islamist movement , of attempting to infiltrate state institutions to establish an " islamist-inspired " system in turkey , which is a strictly secular country .
as proof , it points to the akp 's move to allow women to wear islamic-style headscarves at universities , attempts to restrict public drinking of alcohol to " red light zones " and appointments to public sector positions seemingly based on the religious convictions of the applicants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan said the court case will only increase his popularity the indictment seeks to have erdogan , president abdullah gul and 69 other akp figures , from ministers to local council mayors , banned from politics for five years .
secularists claim that the party has a secret agenda to replace the secular order with religious rule in the mainly muslim country .
the akp rejects the charges and says it is fully committed to the strict separation of state and religion enshrined in the constitution .
erdogan remains defiant prime minister erdogan has slammed as an attack on democracy .
erdogan said the attempt to shut down the akp would only make his party more popular .
" our votes will increase .
we are in charge .
no one can take us off our path , " erdogan said after a meeting with colleagues in ankara .
turkish newspapers speculated that the akp might try to force through constitutional changes that would make it very difficult for the court to shut down the party .
the party has a clear majority in parliament but would need the support of an extreme right-wing opposition party in order to get constitutional changes passed .
ban decision not final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more hurdle to joining the eu ?
" the indictment has been distributed to our members and we are in the process of appointing a rapporteur to study the indictment , " the court 's deputy chairman osman alifeyyaz paksut told reporters .
paksut said a " preliminary study " would be finished within 10 days .
the 11-member tribunal has to approve court of appeals chief prosecutor abdurrahman yalcinkaya 's indictment against the akp before a court case can begin .
a final verdict is not expected for several months .
a blow to turkey 's eu aspirations berlin shares the view of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who warned saturday that " the legal system should n't meddle in democratic politics . "
turkish labor minister faruk celik told reuters that the entire case was a bid by nationalists inside the judiciary to try and block turkey 's eu membership bid .
" there are people with nationalist sentiments and they are upset about turkey 's march towards the eu .
they are trying to reverse this but this is against the founding philosophy of the republic , which is a march towards the west , " celik said .
turkey 's eu bid already faces opposition from many current members .

china was clearly taken aback by the resignation of the film director steven spielberg as an adviser to the games .
and just as china was hoping that the spielberg affair had died down , along comes tibet .
china seems not to have fully understood the extent to which the olympic games exposes the host 's policies to criticism .
britain will find the same in 2012 .
the chinese government had hoped that its policy of partial opening would be enough .
since 2007 , for example , foreign journalists are meant to be allowed to travel freely to much of china , though of course tibet was immediately put out of bounds once the protests started .
the old habits kicked in .
bigger problem tibet is potentially a much bigger problem for china than the resignation of a hollywood director as " artistic adviser " to the beijing olympics .
steven spielberg was protesting that china had not used its links with sudan to help bring an end to violence in darfur .
the publicity in that case was not good for china 's aim of presenting the olympics as the moment in which its " peaceful rise " was accepted worldwide .
but china is not directly responsible for darfur .
it is directly responsible for tibet .
threat of boycott tibet has always had a romantic association around the world , fostered by the figure of the exiled spiritual leader the dalai lama .
if the protests in tibet are repressed too harshly , then calls for a boycott of the games could grow , even though the dalai lama himself is not calling for such a move .
governments around the world would be forced to make comments more critical of china over tibet than they normally do .
many governments feel that china has not balanced its policy in tibet properly .
it has undoubtedly poured a lot of money in to improve economic conditions , the railway link to lhasa being the latest example .
but it has also poured in chinese immigrants and has , in the view of foreign governments and human rights observers , neglected the cultural aspirations of the tibetans .
this feeling was evident in a statement on 15 march by the us secretary of state condoleezza rice who said in part : " we also urge china to address policies in tibetan areas that have created tensions due to their impact on tibetan religion , culture , and livelihoods . "
raising human rights the british foreign secretary david miliband said recently that diplomats no longer had to fear that raising human rights with china meant that economic relations would be damaged .
however , visits by prime minister gordon brown and the french president nicolas sarkozy to china showed little evidence that human rights had featured much during their talks .
mr miliband 's confidence will no doubt strengthen the chances of the dalai lama meeting mr brown during an expected visit to britain in may .
he was refused a meeting with the previous prime minister , tony blair , in 2004 .
foreign governments accept chinese rule in tibet and do not recognise the tibetan government-in-exile in india .
those governments are not calling for tibetan independence .
nor is the dalai lama , though china accuses him of doing so .
he says he would like " meaningful autonomy " within the chinese state .
however , a balanced solution along those lines seems far off .
the everest ban an example of china 's habits of control can even be seen on the peaks of mount everest .
it was the everest climbers ' website everest news that earlier this month revealed that china had closed mount everest on the tibetan side until 10 may .
it has since persuaded the government of nepal , to which it gives substantial economic aid , to do the same on its side .
the stated reason is " concern of heavy climbing activities , crowded climbing routes and increasing environmental pressures " .
but the real reason is probably to allow a chinese team to reach the summit with the olympic torch - without risking other climbers flying the tibetan flag at the same time .

china was clearly taken aback by the resignation of the film director steven spielberg as an adviser to the games .
and just as china was hoping that the spielberg affair had died down , along comes tibet .
china seems not to have fully understood the extent to which the olympic games exposes the host 's policies to criticism .
britain will find the same in 2012 .
the chinese government had hoped that its policy of partial opening would be enough .
since 2007 , for example , foreign journalists are meant to be allowed to travel freely to much of china , though of course tibet was immediately put out of bounds once the protests started .
the old habits kicked in .
bigger problem tibet is potentially a much bigger problem for china than the resignation of a hollywood director as " artistic adviser " to the beijing olympics .
steven spielberg was protesting that china had not used its links with sudan to help bring an end to violence in darfur .
the publicity in that case was not good for china 's aim of presenting the olympics as the moment in which its " peaceful rise " was accepted worldwide .
but china is not directly responsible for darfur .
it is directly responsible for tibet .
threat of boycott tibet has always had a romantic association around the world , fostered by the figure of the exiled spiritual leader the dalai lama .
if the protests in tibet are repressed too harshly , then calls for a boycott of the games could grow , even though the dalai lama himself is not calling for such a move .
governments around the world would be forced to make comments more critical of china over tibet than they normally do .
many governments feel that china has not balanced its policy in tibet properly .
it has undoubtedly poured a lot of money in to improve economic conditions , the railway link to lhasa being the latest example .
but it has also poured in chinese immigrants and has , in the view of foreign governments and human rights observers , neglected the cultural aspirations of the tibetans .
this feeling was evident in a statement on 15 march by the us secretary of state condoleezza rice who said in part : " we also urge china to address policies in tibetan areas that have created tensions due to their impact on tibetan religion , culture , and livelihoods . "
raising human rights the british foreign secretary david miliband said recently that diplomats no longer had to fear that raising human rights with china meant that economic relations would be damaged .
however , visits by prime minister gordon brown and the french president nicolas sarkozy to china showed little evidence that human rights had featured much during their talks .
mr miliband 's confidence will no doubt strengthen the chances of the dalai lama meeting mr brown during an expected visit to britain in may .
he was refused a meeting with the previous prime minister , tony blair , in 2004 .
foreign governments accept chinese rule in tibet and do not recognise the tibetan government-in-exile in india .
those governments are not calling for tibetan independence .
nor is the dalai lama , though china accuses him of doing so .
he says he would like " meaningful autonomy " within the chinese state .
however , a balanced solution along those lines seems far off .
the everest ban an example of china 's habits of control can even be seen on the peaks of mount everest .
it was the everest climbers ' website everest news that earlier this month revealed that china had closed mount everest on the tibetan side until 10 may .
it has since persuaded the government of nepal , to which it gives substantial economic aid , to do the same on its side .
the stated reason is " concern of heavy climbing activities , crowded climbing routes and increasing environmental pressures " .
but the real reason is probably to allow a chinese team to reach the summit with the olympic torch - without risking other climbers flying the tibetan flag at the same time .

shell said its reserves replacement ratio for the year was 109 % , meaning that it had found more oil and gas in the ground than it had produced .
however , the firm did not commit to previously stated near-term growth targets of 1 % to 2 % to 2010 .
shell posted annual profits of $ 27.56bn -lrb- £ 13.6bn -rrb- , a record for a uk-listed company , helped by soaring oil prices .
when the firm posted its profit figures in january , it failed to state its reserves , which had raised concerns that the numbers could be disappointing .
net reserves stood at 11.9 billion barrels equivalent at the end of 2007 , similar to that seen a year earlier .
the firm also raised its estimates of its overall oil and gas resources to 66 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 2007 .

the news has rattled investors worldwide , who fear that the credit crisis is deepening .
the bank got into trouble over its sub-prime mortgage debts , and other banks had stopped lending to it .
the rescue has been backed by the us federal reserve , who will lend $ 30bn and lower its discount rate to 3.25 % .
the discount rate is the rate at which the fed lends to the banking sector , but the fed is widely expected to slash interest rates that affect consumers as well - by up to 1 % - when it meets on tuesday .
taking inflation into account this would take interest rates into negative territory .
and it has created a new lending facility for big investment banks , who will be able to borrow against the value of their mortgage assets .
stock markets fell sharply around the world on monday , with the hong kong index down 5 % , the japanese market nearly 4 % , while london 's ftse dropped 100 points on its opening .

its shares have lost 98 % of their value since their high of $ 158 in april one year ago , when the bank was worth $ 18bn .
it means that the former chief executive of the bank , jimmy cayne , the richest boss on wall street , has seen his fortune plummet from $ 1bn to $ 12m .
in october , the shares were still worth $ 117 , but by friday , they had fallen to $ 30 -lrb- £ 15 -rrb- after an emergency rescue package was announced .
under the deal , which emerged on sunday , the federal reserve will fund up to $ 30bn of bear stearns 's less liquid assets .
in turn , jp morgan will guarantee to meet all the payments due to bear stearns clients .

that 's very unclear " robert peston , bbc business editor read robert 's thoughts in full bear stearns 's problems stem from the global credit crunch and the worry is that other lenders may also have major funding problems .
last week , speculation had intensified that the bank was struggling to fund its daily business .
bbc business editor robert peston said bear stearns was taken to the brink of insolvency last week by a sudden collapse in confidence on the part of its hedge fund clients .
as a result , these clients rushed to withdraw their assets .
' other banks ' the credit crunch was caused because banks became less willing to lend to each other after they suffered large losses on investments linked to the us housing market , and the sub-prime sector in particular .
but the crisis has now become more general , with other kinds of assets also looking vulnerable .
sub-prime lenders focus on clients with poor or non-existent credit histories , and a record number of borrowers have defaulted on loans .
the subsequent freezing-up of the credit markets created problems for a number of companies which relied on borrowing money to fund their business .
in the uk , northern rock ran into trouble when its line of relatively cheap credit dried up .
at the end of last year , bear stearns reported that it had made its first ever quarterly loss after buying investments linked to the us mortgage market .
it was one of the first to admit it had problems linked to sub-prime mortgages , after two of its hedge funds had to be bailed out in july .
robert peston said that last week 's move by jpmorgan and the fed of new york was essentially a central bank bailout , and described the crisis as " america 's northern rock " .

the news has rattled investors worldwide , who fear that the credit crisis is deepening .
the bank got into trouble over its sub-prime mortgage debts , and other banks had stopped lending to it .
the rescue has been backed by the us federal reserve , who will lend $ 30bn and lower its discount rate to 3.25 % .
the discount rate is the rate at which the fed lends to the banking sector , but the fed is widely expected to slash interest rates that affect consumers as well - by up to 1 % - when it meets on tuesday .

that 's very unclear robert peston , bbc business editor read robert 's thoughts in full bear stearns 's problems stem from the global credit crunch and the worry is that other lenders may also have major funding problems .
last week , speculation had intensified that the bank was struggling to fund its daily business .
bbc business editor robert peston said bear stearns was taken to the brink of insolvency last week by a sudden collapse in confidence on the part of its hedge fund clients .
as a result , these clients rushed to withdraw their assets .
' other banks ' the credit crunch was caused because banks became less willing to lend to each other after they suffered large losses on investments linked to the us housing market , and the sub-prime sector in particular .
but the crisis has now become more general , with other kinds of assets also looking vulnerable .
sub-prime lenders focus on clients with poor or non-existent credit histories , and a record number of borrowers have defaulted on loans .
the subsequent freezing-up of the credit markets created problems for a number of companies which relied on borrowing money to fund their business .
in the uk , northern rock ran into trouble when its line of relatively cheap credit dried up .
at the end of last year , bear stearns reported that it had made its first ever quarterly loss after buying investments linked to the us mortgage market .
it was one of the first to admit it had problems linked to sub-prime mortgages , after two of its hedge funds had to be bailed out in july .
robert peston said that last week 's move by jpmorgan and the fed of new york was essentially a central bank bailout , and described the crisis as " america 's northern rock " .

page last updated at 08:53 gmt , monday , 17 march 2008 e-mail this to a friend printable version methadone paradise sarah paterson reporter the politics show scotland methadone is used to assist heroin users back to normal lives fat , dumb and happy .
no - not the title for a new hollywood comedy .
but a serious attempt to sum up 20,000 + drug users on the methadone programme by one of holyrood 's top politicians .
in an interview for this programme , the conservative justice spokesman bill aitken says a high proportion of the drug-abusing population are sitting " fat , dumb and happy " on methadone .
he reckons we rely too much on the heroin substitute and should make more addicts go cold-turkey .
the scottish government has already promised to promote abstinence in its new national drugs strategy as part of the budget deal compromise with the tories .
the conservatives want a new radical approach to the treatment of addicts is needed .
they say a shift away from treating addicts with methadone towards recovery and abstinence is needed .
" it 's the extent of it .
we have a very high proportion of the drug abusing population sitting fat dumb and happy on methadone , now the only thing can be said in many instances , not all it prevents them from committing crime .
this is not the answer . "
" get them back into the community the only way your going to do that not in every case , is by a much greater degree of abstinence based treatments . "
hard line it 's this hard line approach that is at odds with the previous government 's strategy .
labour 's richard simpson says bill aitken needs to say sorry and remember that his comments are not helpful in the wider debate .
" bill aitkens words are really deeply offensive and he must apologise for them .
" there are many patients on methadone who get back into work education or training .
" we do need a grown up debate about the treatments available for people with drug addiction and we need to look at alternatives including abstinence and other pharmalogical treatments but we do not need this sort of language in this discussion . "
drug death capital scotland is europe 's drug death capital .
figures published by the un reveal that the number of drug related deaths rose by 25 % on the previous year and are now at the highest number since records began .
the snp government are reviewing the current spending on drug treatment and assessing whether there is enough choice for addicts in the provision of services that promote abstinence and offer residential rehabilitation .
so what are the choices facing the thousands of drug addicts in scotland .
the bethany christian centre offers a six month residential programme where no drug substitutes are allowed .
according to chief executive , iain gordon four of five people who complete the programme remain abstinent nine months later .
alex is one of the newest residents on the programme .
" i think you have to be rehabilitation to do it , too difficult outside , you need support to set you free . "
stability created ?
abstinence programmes have had some success in treating long term drug addiction but most practitioners who treat drug addicts believe that the use of methadone plays an important part in recovery .
patrick joyce from the links project , edinburgh said : " i think what methadone does is it starts to build in a baseline stability that enables people then to concentrate on their recovery .
" it 's actually been a key tool enabling people to look at the possibility of abstinence and drug free for the first time and from that sense it 's been very useful indeed and been able to move people on . "
the big question facing the government as it reviews scotland 's drugs policy , is do we need to see a big shift away from treating addicts with methadone and if the conservatives more radical approach to the treatment of addicts is needed - where will the funding come from - in what is a tight economic climate .

in an interview for this programme , the conservative justice spokesman bill aitken says a high proportion of the drug-abusing population are sitting " fat , dumb and happy " on methadone .
he reckons we rely too much on the heroin substitute and should make more addicts go cold-turkey .
the scottish government has already promised to promote abstinence in its new national drugs strategy as part of the budget deal compromise with the tories .
the conservatives want a new radical approach to the treatment of addicts is needed .
they say a shift away from treating addicts with methadone towards recovery and abstinence is needed .
" it 's the extent of it .
we have a very high proportion of the drug abusing population sitting fat dumb and happy on methadone , now the only thing can be said in many instances , not all it prevents them from committing crime .
this is not the answer . "
" get them back into the community the only way your going to do that not in every case , is by a much greater degree of abstinence based treatments . "
hard line it 's this hard line approach that is at odds with the previous government 's strategy .
labour 's richard simpson says bill aitken needs to say sorry and remember that his comments are not helpful in the wider debate .
" bill aitkens words are really deeply offensive and he must apologise for them .
" there are many patients on methadone who get back into work education or training .
" we do need a grown up debate about the treatments available for people with drug addiction and we need to look at alternatives including abstinence and other pharmalogical treatments but we do not need this sort of language in this discussion . "
drug death capital scotland is europe 's drug death capital .
figures published by the un reveal that the number of drug related deaths rose by 25 % on the previous year and are now at the highest number since records began .
the snp government are reviewing the current spending on drug treatment and assessing whether there is enough choice for addicts in the provision of services that promote abstinence and offer residential rehabilitation .
so what are the choices facing the thousands of drug addicts in scotland .
the bethany christian centre offers a six month residential programme where no drug substitutes are allowed .
according to chief executive , iain gordon four of five people who complete the programme remain abstinent nine months later .
alex is one of the newest residents on the programme .
" i think you have to be rehabilitation to do it , too difficult outside , you need support to set you free . "
stability created ?
abstinence programmes have had some success in treating long term drug addiction but most practitioners who treat drug addicts believe that the use of methadone plays an important part in recovery .
patrick joyce from the links project , edinburgh said : " i think what methadone does is it starts to build in a baseline stability that enables people then to concentrate on their recovery .
" it 's actually been a key tool enabling people to look at the possibility of abstinence and drug free for the first time and from that sense it 's been very useful indeed and been able to move people on . "
the big question facing the government as it reviews scotland 's drugs policy , is do we need to see a big shift away from treating addicts with methadone and if the conservatives more radical approach to the treatment of addicts is needed - where will the funding come from - in what is a tight economic climate .

the independent panel said evidence to show what worked in drug treatment was " seriously weak or absent " .
more than £ 330m is spent in england and wales on treating offenders annually .
the panel said some treatment services risked doing more harm than good .
it criticised the carat service , which took on 78,000 new prisoners last year .
return to drugs in a report seen by bbc home editor mark easton , the commission said the treatment service cost £ 31m to run but " there are no evaluations of its effectiveness " .
it found for the 40,000 prisoners who go through detox while in jail , a lack of proper aftercare meant many went straight back to using hard drugs when they left prison .
and that one in 200 injecting heroin users would be dead from an overdose within a fortnight of being released .
there was also a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of drug-free wings in prisons , it said . "
answers to even basic questions are not freely available and the weakness of the evidence base severely hampers good practice " uk drug policy commission " given the considerable ongoing investment in criminal justice system drug interventions , it is striking that we still know so little about the effectiveness of many of them , especially those in prisons and crucially whether they represent value for money " , it added .
while community programmes appeared to work better , they were no magic bullet .
in february , the government launched its 10-year drugs strategy , which saw more money focused on drug-dependent offenders .
but the commission said : " we simply do not know enough about which programmes work best for whom .
" answers to even basic questions are not freely available and the weakness of the evidence base severely hampers good practice . "
the report was highly critical of the quality of treatment in jails , where " provision often falls short of even minimum standards ... a major concern for the health and well-being of prisoners and the subsequent impact on crime " .
government 's ' difficulties ' but the government said there was a growing body of evidence treating offenders could reduce drug-related crime .
its new drugs strategy made " proactively targeting and managing drug-misusing offenders " a key element .
an additional £ 25m a year will be spent on treating offenders by 2011 .
justice minister david hanson welcomed the commission 's report .
he said it recognised the challenges , difficulties and recent improvements in drug treatment .
he said 53 prisons would benefit from health funding for enhanced clinical drug services by april .
the £ 175m drugs intervention programme treated 40,000 offenders in the community last year .
six months later , 47 % had reduced their offending .
but 28 % had increased .
widening warning the report said plans to widen treatment to drug users whose habit was not directly related to their offending was " likely to be inefficient and could be harmful " .
the risk was that younger recreational drug users would fail to complete some treatment programme and would end up being further criminalised .
the law of diminishing returns could kick in , making the scheme less effective and more expensive , it warned .
chairman of the british medical association 's forensic medicine committee , george fernie , said the prison system lacked a " comprehensive care package " from when someone entered the custodial chain to when they were released .
" technically , it is not that difficult to get somebody off drugs , " he said .
" it is the follow-through that we have to have , with stable housing , employment and family support . "
he backed community treatment , saying : " prisons are perhaps not awash with drugs , but illegal substances are readily available .
" we would like people treated effectively in the community if the alternative is a short prison sentence . "

it 's the process , currently under way with a vengeance , of banks and financial institutions asking for their loans back , especially from borrowers perceived as high risk .
it follows years of the opposite , known - unsurprisingly - as leveraging .
there 's pain for all of us - in the form of less credit , cripplingly expensive credit or a drop in the value of the investments held by the pension funds on which we depend in the leveraging era , the world 's banks and other great lenders lent far too much - to businesses , to various financial speculators , such as hedge funds and private-equity investors , to homeowners , to shoppers , and even to each other .
a great bubble of debt was created .
that bubble was punctured last summer , when lenders suddenly realised that some of their loans - the subprime ones to us homeowners with poor credit histories - were n't ever going to be repaid in full .
' bad risks ' since then lenders have been asking for their money back from those perceived to be a lousy credit prospect - and pushing up the cost of credit for almost everyone .
this deleveraging process , which has gone in fits and starts , moved up a gear in the past fortnight , as lenders became increasingly fearful about the outlook for the biggest economy in the world , that of the us .
bear stearns employs 2000 people in london borrowers dependent on certain parts of the us economy , especially its ailing housing market , are increasingly perceived as bad risks .
that 's what caused the crises last week at carlyle capital corporation and bear stearns .
in the coming days you can expect more bad news from financial firms whose sources of finance are drying up .
now , in many ways deleveraging is a good thing .
it 's time we learned not to borrow more than we can afford .
the problem is that the process of deleveraging causes pain , and not just to wall street firms or wealthy investors .
mortgage pot shrinking there 's pain for all of us - in the form of less credit , cripplingly expensive credit or a drop in the value of the investments held by the pension funds on which we depend .
or if a company that 's borrowed too much runs into difficulties , well then there 's a potential financial cost to its employees .
even bear stearns , primarily a wall street firm , employs 2000 people in london .
the amount of uk mortgage finance available is shrinking so is there nothing that governments can do to minimise the dislocation caused by deleveraging ?
well in a way our own government has actually been encouraging deleveraging , by supporting the plan of northern rock - the nationalised bank - to shrink its balance sheet by around £ 60bn .
the impact of that is to cut the amount of mortgage finance available in the uk by up to a fifth .
as for central banks , they increasingly look not like supermen but seven-stone weaklings .
they 've been reducing official interest rates , but that 's done little to cut the cost of credit for most of us or increase its availability , because banks have taken the opportunity to rebuild their profit margins .
' dodgy assets ' and what about central banks ' new willingness to allow banks to swap financial assets of dubious value for hard cash or liquid government bonds ?
well that may have encouraged lenders to seize dodgy assets from borrowers that are in trouble in order to dump them on a central bank like the new york fed .
in other words , central banks may inadvertently be accelerating that fateful deleveraging process .
worse still , perhaps , the cost of longer-term loans is being pushed up , because lenders and investors believe the fed is devaluing the dollar and stoking up inflation .
as the distinguished economist joseph stiglitz has observed , much of central banks ' evasive action looks as effective as pushing on a piece of string .

it 's the process , currently under way with a vengeance , of banks and financial institutions asking for their loans back , especially from borrowers perceived as high risk .
it follows years of the opposite , known - unsurprisingly - as leveraging .
there 's pain for all of us - in the form of less credit , cripplingly expensive credit or a drop in the value of the investments held by the pension funds on which we depend in the leveraging era , the world 's banks and other great lenders lent far too much - to businesses , to various financial speculators , such as hedge funds and private-equity investors , to homeowners , to shoppers , and even to each other .
a great bubble of debt was created .
that bubble was punctured last summer , when lenders suddenly realised that some of their loans - the subprime ones to us homeowners with poor credit histories - were n't ever going to be repaid in full .
' bad risks ' since then lenders have been asking for their money back from those perceived to be a lousy credit prospect - and pushing up the cost of credit for almost everyone .
this deleveraging process , which has gone in fits and starts , moved up a gear in the past fortnight , as lenders became increasingly fearful about the outlook for the biggest economy in the world , that of the us .
bear stearns employs 2000 people in london borrowers dependent on certain parts of the us economy , especially its ailing housing market , are increasingly perceived as bad risks .
that 's what caused the crises last week at carlyle capital corporation and bear stearns .
in the coming days you can expect more bad news from financial firms whose sources of finance are drying up .
now , in many ways deleveraging is a good thing .
it 's time we learned not to borrow more than we can afford .
the problem is that the process of deleveraging causes pain , and not just to wall street firms or wealthy investors .
mortgage pot shrinking there 's pain for all of us - in the form of less credit , cripplingly expensive credit or a drop in the value of the investments held by the pension funds on which we depend .
or if a company that 's borrowed too much runs into difficulties , well then there 's a potential financial cost to its employees .
even bear stearns , primarily a wall street firm , employs 2000 people in london .
the amount of uk mortgage finance available is shrinking so is there nothing that governments can do to minimise the dislocation caused by deleveraging ?
well in a way our own government has actually been encouraging deleveraging , by supporting the plan of northern rock - the nationalised bank - to shrink its balance sheet by around £ 60bn .
the impact of that is to cut the amount of mortgage finance available in the uk by up to a fifth .
as for central banks , they increasingly look not like supermen but seven-stone weaklings .
they 've been reducing official interest rates , but that 's done little to cut the cost of credit for most of us or increase its availability , because banks have taken the opportunity to rebuild their profit margins .
' dodgy assets ' and what about central banks ' new willingness to allow banks to swap financial assets of dubious value for hard cash or liquid government bonds ?
well that may have encouraged lenders to seize dodgy assets from borrowers that are in trouble in order to dump them on a central bank like the new york fed .
in other words , central banks may inadvertently be accelerating that fateful deleveraging process .
worse still , perhaps , the cost of longer-term loans is being pushed up , because lenders and investors believe the fed is devaluing the dollar and stoking up inflation .
as the distinguished economist joseph stiglitz has observed , much of central banks ' evasive action looks as effective as pushing on a piece of string .

the problem is that the process of deleveraging causes pain , and not just to wall street firms or wealthy investors .
mortgage pot shrinking there 's pain for all of us - in the form of less credit , cripplingly expensive credit or a drop in the value of the investments held by the pension funds on which we depend .
or if a company that 's borrowed too much runs into difficulties , well then there 's a potential financial cost to its employees .
even bear stearns , primarily a wall street firm , employs 2000 people in london .
so is there nothing that governments can do to minimise the dislocation caused by deleveraging ?
well in a way our own government has actually been encouraging deleveraging , by supporting the plan of northern rock - the nationalised bank - to shrink its balance sheet by around £ 60bn .
the impact of that is to cut the amount of mortgage finance available in the uk by up to a fifth .
as for central banks , they increasingly look not like supermen but seven-stone weaklings .
they 've been reducing official interest rates , but that 's done little to cut the cost of credit for most of us or increase its availability , because banks have taken the opportunity to rebuild their profit margins .
' dodgy assets ' and what about central banks ' new willingness to allow banks to swap financial assets of dubious value for hard cash or liquid government bonds ?
well that may have encouraged lenders to seize dodgy assets from borrowers that are in trouble in order to dump them on a central bank like the new york fed .
in other words , central banks may inadvertently be accelerating that fateful deleveraging process .
worse still , perhaps , the cost of longer-term loans is being pushed up , because lenders and investors believe the fed is devaluing the dollar and stoking up inflation .
as the distinguished economist joseph stiglitz has observed , much of central banks ' evasive action looks as effective as pushing on a piece of string .
