meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche , the company ’ s primary shareholder had lobbied hard against the bill . the new legislation is an amendment to the 48-year-old " volkswagen law , " which protects the car manufacturer from takeover .
it had been struck down last year by the european union 's highest court .
berlin , however , on thursday , nov .
13 , ruled that the state of lower saxony would have veto rights at shareholder meetings that normally require a share stake of at least 25 percent .
home to volkswagen , lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of the company .
porsche , the company 's primary shareholder , will own just under 75 percent of the giant car manufacturer by next year .
a solid majority of legislators in germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament backed the bill , which is a welcome addition because the state is considered a guarantor of jobs at volkswagen , the largest industrial company in lower saxony .
eu vows action claiming the revised law violates eu rules on the free flow of capital however , the european commission is demanding that the law be scrapped .
" we will move ahead with the case in the next few weeks , " a commission spokesman said .
with the new law , lower saxony can block strategic decisions made by porsche , a move that the prestigious automobile brand has contested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised vw workers she would back the new bill in brussels porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking wrote to legislators , predicting that law would cause future problems for berlin .
bernd osterloh , the labor leader at volkswagen , applauded the law however as a " grand signal " and claimed it is in full compliance with eu law .
merkel vows to defend new bill in a speech at the volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in september , german chancellor angela merkel said that she believed the new law met eu demands and was adamant about defending the blocking minority clause in brussels .

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .

the request comes as the financial crisis pounds european carmakers . " the aim of the current discussions is to make preparations for guaranteeing further loans because the global financial situation of our parent company general motors has worsened , " opel chief executive hans demant told the online edition of handelsblatt .
" we want to ensure opel 's future in europe but also jobs , which is why we have the full support of our employees , " he continued .
opel and other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw have announced temporary closures of factories to save costs following a huge drop in orders .
in addition to asking berlin for help , opel has also asked that states in which the company has plants to step up to the plate as well .
these include north-rhine westphalia , rhineland-palatinate , hessen and thuringia . according to the handelsblatt , hessen 's government is " clearly ready to provide 500 million euros .

opel also requested soft loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market .
merkel 's ruling coalition conceded to scrap the tax on new cars bought in the first half of 2009 , but the move has evidently provided little comfort for opel .
the company is also seeking a pan-european plan worth 40 billion euros to provide low-cost loans from the european investment bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "

this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 14.11.2008 landmark cases force europe to reconsider right to die großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having the right to die is a hotly debated topic across europe a top italian court has allowed doctors to cut life support to a coma patient , though euthanasia is n't legal in the country .
meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .

british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the fourth such expulsion in three weeks , a 12-year-old schoolgirl was made to leave a train an hour 's ride from home because she could not pay a 40-euro fine .
passenger groups are leading the campaign to shame deutsche bahn after the embarrassing incidents made headlines across the country this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro bahn 's naumann is leading the criticism against db " it is purely foolish to react in such a way , " karl-peter naumann , director of the passenger organization pro bahn , told reuters .
" banishing them from the train is inhumane and causes unnecessary problems . "
the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .
in that expulsion , a 14-year-old was told to leave a train because her ticket was only valid later in the day .
but other reports of incidents previous to that soon came to light including the case of a 13-year-old child who had to carry her cello 5 km -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- home in the dark .
another documented incident involved a 12-year-old being dumped on a platform with no money or mobile phone .
deutsche bahn has since apologized and stated on wednesday that all its ticket inspectors would have to sign an agreement promising not to banish children from trains if travelling alone .
" everybody should know that it is unacceptable to throw children off the train , " a deutsche bahn spokesman told the taz daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche , the company ’ s primary shareholder had lobbied hard against the bill . the new legislation is an amendment to the 48-year-old " volkswagen law , " which protects the car manufacturer from takeover .
it had been struck down last year by the european union 's highest court .
berlin , however , on thursday , nov .
13 , ruled that the state of lower saxony would have veto rights at shareholder meetings that normally require a share stake of at least 25 percent .
home to volkswagen , lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of the company .
porsche , the company 's primary shareholder , will own just under 75 percent of the giant car manufacturer by next year .
a solid majority of legislators in germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament backed the bill , which is a welcome addition because the state is considered a guarantor of jobs at volkswagen , the largest industrial company in lower saxony .
eu vows action claiming the revised law violates eu rules on the free flow of capital however , the european commission is demanding that the law be scrapped .
" we will move ahead with the case in the next few weeks , " a commission spokesman said .
with the new law , lower saxony can block strategic decisions made by porsche , a move that the prestigious automobile brand has contested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised vw workers she would back the new bill in brussels porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking wrote to legislators , predicting that law would cause future problems for berlin .
bernd osterloh , the labor leader at volkswagen , applauded the law however as a " grand signal " and claimed it is in full compliance with eu law .
merkel vows to defend new bill in a speech at the volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in september , german chancellor angela merkel said that she believed the new law met eu demands and was adamant about defending the blocking minority clause in brussels .
thousands of vw workers have demonstrated in support of the law , which is also backed by christian wulff , lower saxony 's premier . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .

that label now can officially be applied in the euro zone . the 15-member euro zone officially slumped into recession after figures out friday , nov .
14 , showed its economy contracting by 0.2 percent for a second quarter in a row . the euro zone 's latest gdp estimates were published just one day before heads of state and government from the world 's 20 leading economies were due to meet in washington to discuss the global financial crisis , which experts say is partly to blame for europe 's economic slowdown . according to flash estimates from the european statistical office , eurostat , gross domestic product in two of the euro area 's biggest economies , germany and italy , fell by 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008 , after falling by 0.4 percent in the second . another euro zone heavyweight , france , saw its gdp grow by just 0.1 percent in the third quarter , after contracting by 0.3 percent in the previous three months . recession in germany the eurostat figures confirmed that europe 's economic locomotive , germany , had entered into recession for the first time in five years on the back of falling exports . the german parliament has just approved a 12-billion-euro -lrb- $ 15-billion -rrb- economic-stimulus package put together by chancellor angela merkel amid concerns that the slump will continue in 2009 . in italy , business confidence dropped to its lowest level in almost 15 years in october , with officials expecting the economy to stagnate in 2009 . gdp in the euro zone 's fourth-largest economy , spain , contracted for the first time in 15 years in the third quarter , by 0.2 percent , with analysts attributing the slowdown mainly to the collapse of the country 's key construction sector . while european union gdp also fell by 0.2 percent in the third quarter , economic growth in the 27-member bloc was stuck at zero percent in the second quarter . car sales down in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drop in car sales also indicates recession economists ' technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth . however , there were more signs friday that the eu was also suffering , with sales of new passenger cars plunging by 14.5 percent in october , compared to the same month last year , according to the european car manufacturers ' association , acea . the sharpest drops in demand were found in latvia -lrb- -37.7 percent -rrb- , spain -lrb- -23.8 percent -rrb- and ireland -lrb- -18.2 percent -rrb- . european carmakers have long been lobbying governments to introduce financial incentives to boost sales as they try to fulfil the eu 's request for less-polluting vehicles . the only good economic news of the day came from inflation figures , with eurostat confirming that consumer prices in the euro zone had slowed to 3.2 percent in october , compared to 3.6 percent in september . inflation in the eu was also down , from 4.2 percent in september to 3.7 percent in october , thanks mainly to a drop in oil prices . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .

porsche , the company ’ s primary shareholder had lobbied hard against the bill . the new legislation is an amendment to the 48-year-old " volkswagen law , " which protects the car manufacturer from takeover .
it had been struck down last year by the european union 's highest court .
berlin , however , on thursday , nov .
13 , ruled that the state of lower saxony would have veto rights at shareholder meetings that normally require a share stake of at least 25 percent .
home to volkswagen , lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of the company .
porsche , the company 's primary shareholder , will own just under 75 percent of the giant car manufacturer by next year .
a solid majority of legislators in germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament backed the bill , which is a welcome addition because the state is considered a guarantor of jobs at volkswagen , the largest industrial company in lower saxony .
eu vows action claiming the revised law violates eu rules on the free flow of capital however , the european commission is demanding that the law be scrapped .
" we will move ahead with the case in the next few weeks , " a commission spokesman said .
with the new law , lower saxony can block strategic decisions made by porsche , a move that the prestigious automobile brand has contested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised vw workers she would back the new bill in brussels porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking wrote to legislators , predicting that law would cause future problems for berlin .
bernd osterloh , the labor leader at volkswagen , applauded the law however as a " grand signal " and claimed it is in full compliance with eu law .
merkel vows to defend new bill in a speech at the volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in september , german chancellor angela merkel said that she believed the new law met eu demands and was adamant about defending the blocking minority clause in brussels .

in the fourth such expulsion in three weeks , a 12-year-old schoolgirl was made to leave a train an hour 's ride from home because she could not pay a 40-euro fine .
passenger groups are leading the campaign to shame deutsche bahn after the embarrassing incidents made headlines across the country this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro bahn 's naumann is leading the criticism against db " it is purely foolish to react in such a way , " karl-peter naumann , director of the passenger organization pro bahn , told reuters .
" banishing them from the train is inhumane and causes unnecessary problems . "
the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .
in that expulsion , a 14-year-old was told to leave a train because her ticket was only valid later in the day .
but other reports of incidents previous to that soon came to light including the case of a 13-year-old child who had to carry her cello 5 km -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- home in the dark .
another documented incident involved a 12-year-old being dumped on a platform with no money or mobile phone .
deutsche bahn has since apologized and stated on wednesday that all its ticket inspectors would have to sign an agreement promising not to banish children from trains if travelling alone .
" everybody should know that it is unacceptable to throw children off the train , " a deutsche bahn spokesman told the taz daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .

the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .

" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the fourth such expulsion in three weeks , a 12-year-old schoolgirl was made to leave a train an hour 's ride from home because she could not pay a 40-euro fine .
passenger groups are leading the campaign to shame deutsche bahn after the embarrassing incidents made headlines across the country this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro bahn 's naumann is leading the criticism against db " it is purely foolish to react in such a way , " karl-peter naumann , director of the passenger organization pro bahn , told reuters .
" banishing them from the train is inhumane and causes unnecessary problems . "
the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .
in that expulsion , a 14-year-old was told to leave a train because her ticket was only valid later in the day .
but other reports of incidents previous to that soon came to light including the case of a 13-year-old child who had to carry her cello 5 km -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- home in the dark .
another documented incident involved a 12-year-old being dumped on a platform with no money or mobile phone .
deutsche bahn has since apologized and stated on wednesday that all its ticket inspectors would have to sign an agreement promising not to banish children from trains if travelling alone .
" everybody should know that it is unacceptable to throw children off the train , " a deutsche bahn spokesman told the taz daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "

meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.11.2008 dr congo 's greatest need is diplomacy , aid worker says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a quarter of a million civilians have been displaced in the brutal fighting in dr congo amid increasing violence in dr congo , aid agencies are struggling to offer help for civilians .
but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .
but the bilateral friendship has to rise above such pettiness and in washington such small childish behavior will hopefully be quelled . christoph hasselbach -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the request comes as the financial crisis pounds european carmakers . " the aim of the current discussions is to make preparations for guaranteeing further loans because the global financial situation of our parent company general motors has worsened , " opel chief executive hans demant told the online edition of handelsblatt .
" we want to ensure opel 's future in europe but also jobs , which is why we have the full support of our employees , " he continued .
opel and other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw have announced temporary closures of factories to save costs following a huge drop in orders .
in addition to asking berlin for help , opel has also asked that states in which the company has plants to step up to the plate as well .

opel also requested soft loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market .
merkel 's ruling coalition conceded to scrap the tax on new cars bought in the first half of 2009 , but the move has evidently provided little comfort for opel .

meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the request comes as the financial crisis pounds european carmakers . " the aim of the current discussions is to make preparations for guaranteeing further loans because the global financial situation of our parent company general motors has worsened , " opel chief executive hans demant told the online edition of handelsblatt .
" we want to ensure opel 's future in europe but also jobs , which is why we have the full support of our employees , " he continued .
opel and other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw have announced temporary closures of factories to save costs following a huge drop in orders .
in addition to asking berlin for help , opel has also asked that states in which the company has plants to step up to the plate as well .
these include north-rhine westphalia , rhineland-palatinate , hessen and thuringia . according to the handelsblatt , hessen 's government is " clearly ready to provide 500 million euros .

opel also requested soft loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market .
merkel 's ruling coalition conceded to scrap the tax on new cars bought in the first half of 2009 , but the move has evidently provided little comfort for opel .
the company is also seeking a pan-european plan worth 40 billion euros to provide low-cost loans from the european investment bank .

meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the fourth such expulsion in three weeks , a 12-year-old schoolgirl was made to leave a train an hour 's ride from home because she could not pay a 40-euro fine .

the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills .

the request comes as the financial crisis pounds european carmakers . " the aim of the current discussions is to make preparations for guaranteeing further loans because the global financial situation of our parent company general motors has worsened , " opel chief executive hans demant told the online edition of handelsblatt .
" we want to ensure opel 's future in europe but also jobs , which is why we have the full support of our employees , " he continued .
opel and other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw have announced temporary closures of factories to save costs following a huge drop in orders .
in addition to asking berlin for help , opel has also asked that states in which the company has plants to step up to the plate as well .
these include north-rhine westphalia , rhineland-palatinate , hessen and thuringia . according to the handelsblatt , hessen 's government is " clearly ready to provide 500 million euros .

opel also requested soft loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market .
merkel 's ruling coalition conceded to scrap the tax on new cars bought in the first half of 2009 , but the move has evidently provided little comfort for opel .

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .
but the bilateral friendship has to rise above such pettiness and in washington such small childish behavior will hopefully be quelled . christoph hasselbach -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.11.2008 dr congo 's greatest need is diplomacy , aid worker says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a quarter of a million civilians have been displaced in the brutal fighting in dr congo amid increasing violence in dr congo , aid agencies are struggling to offer help for civilians .
but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .
but the bilateral friendship has to rise above such pettiness and in washington such small childish behavior will hopefully be quelled . christoph hasselbach -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.11.2008 dr congo 's greatest need is diplomacy , aid worker says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a quarter of a million civilians have been displaced in the brutal fighting in dr congo amid increasing violence in dr congo , aid agencies are struggling to offer help for civilians .
but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .

in the fourth such expulsion in three weeks , a 12-year-old schoolgirl was made to leave a train an hour 's ride from home because she could not pay a 40-euro fine .
passenger groups are leading the campaign to shame deutsche bahn after the embarrassing incidents made headlines across the country this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro bahn 's naumann is leading the criticism against db " it is purely foolish to react in such a way , " karl-peter naumann , director of the passenger organization pro bahn , told reuters .
" banishing them from the train is inhumane and causes unnecessary problems . "
the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .
in that expulsion , a 14-year-old was told to leave a train because her ticket was only valid later in the day .
but other reports of incidents previous to that soon came to light including the case of a 13-year-old child who had to carry her cello 5 km -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- home in the dark .
another documented incident involved a 12-year-old being dumped on a platform with no money or mobile phone .
deutsche bahn has since apologized and stated on wednesday that all its ticket inspectors would have to sign an agreement promising not to banish children from trains if travelling alone .
" everybody should know that it is unacceptable to throw children off the train , " a deutsche bahn spokesman told the taz daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are looking at the -lrb- us -rrb- plan .
the plan has not yet been made official but certainly , if it amounts to illegal state aid we will act at the wto , " barroso told europe 1 radio when asked about the us bailout package .
an aid package worth $ 25 billion was approved by the us congress in september .
the package was earmarked for investment in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made .
since september , all three of the us major car manufacturers - general motors , ford and chrysler - have been hit by the global financial crisis which has savaged the us economy , prompting the auto giants to call for bail-out assistance in much the same way as the country 's banks .
us president-elect barack obama raised the issue of help for the industry with the aim of protecting jobs in the us industrial heartland but president george w. bush has been reluctant to take action .
the wto has a trade dispute mechanism to which aggrieved parties can take their complaints for settlement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.11.2008 dr congo 's greatest need is diplomacy , aid worker says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a quarter of a million civilians have been displaced in the brutal fighting in dr congo amid increasing violence in dr congo , aid agencies are struggling to offer help for civilians .
but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2008 eu , russia agree on new partnership talks and financial policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and medvedev also discussed georgia and the proposed us missile system relations between the eu and russia took another step towards normalization when the presidents of russia and france agreed to continue negotiations on a " new eu-russia agreement " in december . russian president dmitry medvedev and french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , met in nice for four hours on friday before setting off for a meeting in washington with the heads of the world 's most important economies .
the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .

leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .

the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro bahn 's naumann is leading the criticism against db " it is purely foolish to react in such a way , " karl-peter naumann , director of the passenger organization pro bahn , told reuters .
" banishing them from the train is inhumane and causes unnecessary problems . "
the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .
in that expulsion , a 14-year-old was told to leave a train because her ticket was only valid later in the day .
but other reports of incidents previous to that soon came to light including the case of a 13-year-old child who had to carry her cello 5 km -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- home in the dark .
another documented incident involved a 12-year-old being dumped on a platform with no money or mobile phone .
deutsche bahn has since apologized and stated on wednesday that all its ticket inspectors would have to sign an agreement promising not to banish children from trains if travelling alone .
" everybody should know that it is unacceptable to throw children off the train , " a deutsche bahn spokesman told the taz daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.11.2008 dr congo 's greatest need is diplomacy , aid worker says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a quarter of a million civilians have been displaced in the brutal fighting in dr congo amid increasing violence in dr congo , aid agencies are struggling to offer help for civilians .
but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .

what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 germany has many plans and demands for finance summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has admitted there will be " tough talks " in washington leaders from 20 countries will attend the first world finance summit .
germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .

eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.11.2008 dr congo 's greatest need is diplomacy , aid worker says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a quarter of a million civilians have been displaced in the brutal fighting in dr congo amid increasing violence in dr congo , aid agencies are struggling to offer help for civilians .
but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .

other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche , the company ’ s primary shareholder had lobbied hard against the bill . the new legislation is an amendment to the 48-year-old " volkswagen law , " which protects the car manufacturer from takeover .
it had been struck down last year by the european union 's highest court .
berlin , however , on thursday , nov .
13 , ruled that the state of lower saxony would have veto rights at shareholder meetings that normally require a share stake of at least 25 percent .
home to volkswagen , lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of the company .
porsche , the company 's primary shareholder , will own just under 75 percent of the giant car manufacturer by next year .
a solid majority of legislators in germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament backed the bill , which is a welcome addition because the state is considered a guarantor of jobs at volkswagen , the largest industrial company in lower saxony .
eu vows action claiming the revised law violates eu rules on the free flow of capital however , the european commission is demanding that the law be scrapped .
" we will move ahead with the case in the next few weeks , " a commission spokesman said .
with the new law , lower saxony can block strategic decisions made by porsche , a move that the prestigious automobile brand has contested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised vw workers she would back the new bill in brussels porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking wrote to legislators , predicting that law would cause future problems for berlin .
bernd osterloh , the labor leader at volkswagen , applauded the law however as a " grand signal " and claimed it is in full compliance with eu law .
merkel vows to defend new bill in a speech at the volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in september , german chancellor angela merkel said that she believed the new law met eu demands and was adamant about defending the blocking minority clause in brussels .
thousands of vw workers have demonstrated in support of the law , which is also backed by christian wulff , lower saxony 's premier . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin , however , on thursday , nov .
13 , ruled that the state of lower saxony would have veto rights at shareholder meetings that normally require a share stake of at least 25 percent .
home to volkswagen , lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of the company .
porsche , the company 's primary shareholder , will own just under 75 percent of the giant car manufacturer by next year .
a solid majority of legislators in germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament backed the bill , which is a welcome addition because the state is considered a guarantor of jobs at volkswagen , the largest industrial company in lower saxony .
eu vows action claiming the revised law violates eu rules on the free flow of capital however , the european commission is demanding that the law be scrapped .
" we will move ahead with the case in the next few weeks , " a commission spokesman said .
with the new law , lower saxony can block strategic decisions made by porsche , a move that the prestigious automobile brand has contested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised vw workers she would back the new bill in brussels porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking wrote to legislators , predicting that law would cause future problems for berlin .
bernd osterloh , the labor leader at volkswagen , applauded the law however as a " grand signal " and claimed it is in full compliance with eu law .
merkel vows to defend new bill in a speech at the volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in september , german chancellor angela merkel said that she believed the new law met eu demands and was adamant about defending the blocking minority clause in brussels .
thousands of vw workers have demonstrated in support of the law , which is also backed by christian wulff , lower saxony 's premier . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are looking at the -lrb- us -rrb- plan .
the plan has not yet been made official but certainly , if it amounts to illegal state aid we will act at the wto , " barroso told europe 1 radio when asked about the us bailout package .
an aid package worth $ 25 billion was approved by the us congress in september .
the package was earmarked for investment in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made .
since september , all three of the us major car manufacturers - general motors , ford and chrysler - have been hit by the global financial crisis which has savaged the us economy , prompting the auto giants to call for bail-out assistance in much the same way as the country 's banks .
us president-elect barack obama raised the issue of help for the industry with the aim of protecting jobs in the us industrial heartland but president george w. bush has been reluctant to take action .
the wto has a trade dispute mechanism to which aggrieved parties can take their complaints for settlement .
if the eu deems the us package to be illegal state aid , the commission will activate the mechanism in an attempt to win compensation . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 analysis : imf could emerge stronger from financial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf could take on a stronger supervisory role in the future as world leaders gather for a key financial summit in washington , one of the most likely outcomes is a strengthened role for the international monetary fund to help countries pull themselves out of the crisis . the imf has already agreed to provide emergency loans to countries in dire need of cash , including iceland , ukraine , hungary and pakistan , as the financial crisis spread from the united states to the rest of the world .
the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile in britain , a 13-year-old won the right to refuse a potentially life-saving surgery . italy 's top appeals court on thursday , nov .
13 , upheld a july ruling allowing for the removal of feeding tubes supporting a woman who has been in a coma for 16 years . thirty-five-year-old eluana englaro 's case has fuelled controversy over euthanasia in mostly catholic italy where church authorities have spoken out against her elderly father beppino 's wish to terminate her life .
eluana fell into a coma after a 1992 car accident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro has been fighting to take his daughter off life support for 16 years beppino englaro welcomed the court ruling , saying it proved the " rule of law " existed in italy , television news channel sky tg24 reported .
but italy 's interior ministry undersecretary alfredo mantovano condemned the ruling . " some magistrates reject the need to safeguard human life by favoring more or less veiled forms of euthanasia and murder by consent , " mantovano was quoted as saying by the ansa news agency . the ruling could bring to an end a long legal battle which has resonated through italian society by pitting conservatives against those who say people should be allowed to choose what medical treatment they wish to receive and to specify this by means of " living wills . " while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
british girl refuses heart surgery in another case this week , 13-year-old hannah jones from britain was granted the right to refuse a heart surgery that could prolong her life .
she was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four and later contracted cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart , as a result of the leukemia treatment .
doctors told her that her only chance was a heart transplant , but the medication she would have to take would probably cause the leukemia to return .
hannah 's mother kirsty said hannah has already lived twice as long as the 6 months doctors gave when diagnosing the heart condition .
" so you just do n't know what is coming round the corner , " she added .
hannah decided she 'd had enough of being confined to a bed .
her parents accepted her decision , but the health authorities did not .
child protection officers were drafted in and threatened the jones family with a court order to remove her from parents ' custody and force her to undergo the transplant .
hannah , however , convinced the authorities that she did not want a transplant and that she wanted to stay home with her family instead of going back to the hospital .
they gave in .
hannah will now to spend her remaining days with her parents and siblings oliver , 11 , lucy , 10 , and four year-old phoebe , reports said . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .

his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.11.2008 germany has many plans and demands for finance summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has admitted there will be " tough talks " in washington leaders from 20 countries will attend the first world finance summit .
germany has many demands , from more transparency and a supervisory position to a worldwide loan registry and a re-evaluation of banking salaries . german experts compiling a brief for the summit in washington called friday in berlin for a rethink of the way banking executives are paid and for a worldwide loan registry .
the report criticizes short-term performance bonuses for financial executives , saying they were a significant cause of the global financial crisis , according to the officials who saw the document .
the group also called for a world registry of big loans , similar to the database of big domestic credits which germany already has , so that governments can see at a glance how great the credit risks in the nation are .
the european union 's position at the world finance summit this weekend in washington is also the german position .
german chancellor angela merkel had a decisive share in the agreement at the eu summit on nov .
7 , 2008 .
ever since , german deputy economy minister bernd pfaffenbach has been travelling around the world in the run-up to washington to sound out possibilities for an agreement among the participants .
and also to campaign for what is important from germany 's perspective .
when the state and government heads from economically important countries all over the world meet in washington on nov .
15 , in the eyes of the german government it all comes down to one thing : " for us it is important that we draw the right conclusions from the current financial crisis , " says government spokesperson ulrich wilhelm .
" and that through a range of agreed upon measures , we ensure that such a financial market crisis does not happen again . "
merkel hopes for fast results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants need to define joint goals in washington the german government will be hoping for quick results .
but as merkel 's spokesman indicated , it 's unlikely the summit will produce that . but joint goals have to be defined there and then deliberated intensively afterwards between the participants .
the results should then be examined at another summit just weeks away .
according to wilhelm , the federal government wants to convince the partners to enforce more transparency for financial products and that in addition the incentives in the financial market to seek short-term gain under high risk are removed .
the government also wants to convince the summit 's participants that " we also need stronger supervision , for example regarding the question of equity configuration , the regulation of non-banks , " explains wilhelm .
" furthermore , we also need to introduce a monitoring role on an international level . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will dominique strauss-kahn , iwf chief , take on a supervisory role for the financial markets ?
this will be one of the most controversial points in washington .
the german government wants to delegate this monitoring role to the international monetary fund , which is also the european union 's position .
other countries reject this proposal .
the german government 's demand to regulate the financial markets more strongly is not just a reaction to the current crisis .
merkel had already requested a code of conduct for hedge funds at the g8 summit for leading industrial nations in heiligendamm in the summer of 2007 .
it failed however due to resistance from the us and the uk .
but all the same : work orders were then assigned to international expert bodies like the financial market stabilization forum .
this preliminary work can now help in reaching an effective regulation quickly . peter stuetzle -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .
" agreement does not mean that everyone does the same , but rather that everyone has to move in the same direction . "
this is apparently what the 27 nations want .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it were up to the eu , the international monetary fund would gain more power but that concerns cooperation within the eu .
now it is time to deal with the demands of other world players .
what is clear is that the heads of states and governments want financial institutes , markets and even rating agencies all over the world to be regulated or at least monitored .
the international monetary fund should play an increased role , including an early warning system for future financial crises .
managers should no longer be given incentives to focus on short-term gain at the expense of long-term development . in general , risks should be lowered .
in addition , world leaders plan a follow-up conference 100 days after the summit to take stock of progress .
rules only for eu countries ?
dissent exists within the eu about the scale of government regulation and the question of how political it looks .
sarkozy 's talk about a european economic government is seen by many as bordering on socialism and excluding non-european nations .
for german chancellor angela merkel , that is just quibbling .
" you can say that economic cooperation between government leaders is a council that focuses on economic issues , you can even call it an economic government if you like , " merkel said .
" but the point is that it encompasses 27 member countries and there was no discussion about that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy isn ’ t always in agreement with him : finance minister peer steinbrück for all that show of unity , sarkozy did not hide his personal dislike of germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck . according to sarkozy , steinbrueck is sometimes disagreeable .

the request comes as the financial crisis pounds european carmakers . " the aim of the current discussions is to make preparations for guaranteeing further loans because the global financial situation of our parent company general motors has worsened , " opel chief executive hans demant told the online edition of handelsblatt .
" we want to ensure opel 's future in europe but also jobs , which is why we have the full support of our employees , " he continued .
opel and other german carmakers such as daimler and bmw have announced temporary closures of factories to save costs following a huge drop in orders .
in addition to asking berlin for help , opel has also asked that states in which the company has plants to step up to the plate as well .
these include north-rhine westphalia , rhineland-palatinate , hessen and thuringia . according to the handelsblatt , hessen 's government is " clearly ready to provide 500 million euros . " -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- automakers down and out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel hopes merkel can steer the auto industry out of the current crisis hit hard by the economic slowdown , opel this week wrote to chancellor angela merkel requesting she push harder for a 40-billion-euro loan from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to carmakers .
opel also requested soft loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market .
merkel 's ruling coalition conceded to scrap the tax on new cars bought in the first half of 2009 , but the move has evidently provided little comfort for opel .
the company is also seeking a pan-european plan worth 40 billion euros to provide low-cost loans from the european investment bank .

" we are looking at the -lrb- us -rrb- plan .
the plan has not yet been made official but certainly , if it amounts to illegal state aid we will act at the wto , " barroso told europe 1 radio when asked about the us bailout package .
an aid package worth $ 25 billion was approved by the us congress in september .
the package was earmarked for investment in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made .
since september , all three of the us major car manufacturers - general motors , ford and chrysler - have been hit by the global financial crisis which has savaged the us economy , prompting the auto giants to call for bail-out assistance in much the same way as the country 's banks .
us president-elect barack obama raised the issue of help for the industry with the aim of protecting jobs in the us industrial heartland but president george w. bush has been reluctant to take action .
the wto has a trade dispute mechanism to which aggrieved parties can take their complaints for settlement .
if the eu deems the us package to be illegal state aid , the commission will activate the mechanism in an attempt to win compensation . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 14.11.2008 dr congo 's greatest need is diplomacy , aid worker says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a quarter of a million civilians have been displaced in the brutal fighting in dr congo amid increasing violence in dr congo , aid agencies are struggling to offer help for civilians .
but more than anything else , the region needs a diplomatic solution , says one humanitarian aid spokesman . in the democratic republic of congo , m ore than 250,000 civilians have fled fighting between the nation 's unruly armed forces and armed rebel groups .
meanwhile , both sides are accused of rape , killings and looting despite the presence of 17,000 " monuc " troops , one of the world 's largest un peacekeeping operations . kai henning is the africa program officer for the diakonie emergency aid -lrb- diakonie katastrophenhilfe , -rrb- the german protestant church 's international aid organization .
his group , which provides food and other assistance to the " internally displaced " congolese , has had to evacuate their headquarters twice due to the violence . the group has temporarily shut down operations . dw-world : mr. henning , please describe the situation in dr congo , as seen by an aid worker .
what kind of help do people there need most ? the situation is really catastrophic .
it 's not that new : fighting and militia activities and confrontations between the national army and rebel groups have been going on for years here and there .
but it has escalated . in the past two weeks , more and more civilians have been fleeing from the fighting and are displaced .
the numbers are enormous - we are talking about a quarter of a million people who have been displaced in the last two months alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebel troops are led by laurent nkunda people hear gunshots and take their packs and walk 50 kilometers through the jungle just to get somewhere safer .
these " internally displaced persons " - that ’ s the word for refugees who did not cross borders - become squatters in camps where they are hardly taken care of . or , the vast majority , they just arrive somewhere and are hosted by some sort of host families who themselves suffer from malnutrition , and hardly have any clean water or anything to eat . what does your organization do , specifically ? at the moment the most important thing is getting emergency aid to people - food , drink , and shelter .
people need drinking water and blankets .
they need other nonfood items like cooking utensils and hygienic kits . then the next step is establishing self-reliance of the people so they can grow their own crops .
we are thinking of distributing tools and seeds for the people so they can grow their own food . what challenges face aid workers trying to meet these needs ? right now the biggest challenge is access .
when there are fighting zones , then it is impossible for aid workers to go there without risking their own lives and the lives of their staff . the other problem is that many of the displaced persons have fled to the jungle or national parks .
nobody knows how many people have gathered there for refuge .
and for those who have arrived somewhere safely , the number of displaced persons is still so high that there is always more need than can be dealt with by humanitarian organizations . there are continuing reports of sexual violence and rape against civilians .
does your organization take specific action to aid these victims ? this is a huge problem indeed .
among all of the groups … that raid or loot villages , or catch child soldiers , rape and sexual violence is a huge problem .
that is n't just a recent development .
it is a systematic weapon used in this war . but the figures are hard to tell .
only the tip of the iceberg is being counted .
first of all , medical and psycho-social consultation is hard to find .
and many of the women survivors of sexual violence do n't know where to go for treatment or support .
and once people do know where to go , there is the problem of stigmatization and trauma .
so only a very small number is able to be reached . bildunterschrift : displaced congolese walk miles for refuge in this context , humanitarian organizations like diakonie emergency aid really work on all sides .
we offer medical treatment , psycho-social treatment , and also awareness building campaigns . … in our projects where we distribute food aid , we always have components that target victims of sexual violence . what can people who are n't on site do if they want to help ? any support is crucial , for example though donations .
and we also need people to put on pressure for a peaceful solution .
people should put pressure on politicians , pressure within the european union . but another , first step would also be to be aware of how this war is interlinked with our daily life .
there are resources in the congo , metals and minerals , that are used in the production of every mobile phone .
so every time we pick up our mobile phone , we could think about whether we are somehow connected to the fighting going on . so the first thing then is to be aware what role we are playing .
the next step is to really start lobbying for some political solution which takes into account that interconnectedness . the un security council recently pushed back a decision on increasing the number of peacekeepers in the congo , and people have criticized them for looking away .
likewise , eu foreign ministers recently said they have no plans to send more troops .
how will the congo fare without additional help ? when it comes to protecting the population , what diakonie katastrophenhilfe is asking for is secure access to those who are suffering .
and for this , we really require a better outcome from monuc , the un peacekeeping force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing violence has seen an explosion in refugee camps it is hard to say where the problem is . … the mandate is there .
but it seems to be one thing to know what the mandate is - in our case , protecting the congolese people - and on the other hand , to know how to solve the underlying problems .
for that , you need a political solution . as we know , monuc is the largest peacekeeping force in the world , and they have n't been fruitful in the last years . there are widespread concerns that this conflict will spread to angola , rwanda and possibly beyond .
what would that mean for international aid organizations ? the current escalation of the fighting , and all the problems in the congo , go back to the 90s and the " african world war , " as it was called , when at least five other african countries were involved .
the problems from that time have n't been solved . currently , angola is openly joining the fight , and the involvement of rwanda , which has been going on throughout the years , is officially being recognized .
these are part of the problem , but they also show part of the solution . as the congo is a very resource rich country , there are plenty of economic interests there .
all parties want somehow to have a share in the resources .
and in order to really achieve peace , all parties need to come together and reach an agreement . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crisis lender has also made $ 100 billion , about half of its total reserves , available through a new , faster short-term lending program .
imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn has called for more resources , and leaders at the g20 summit in washington are likely to agree .
japan is reportedly ready to offer $ 100 billion , and other countries could follow suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn says the lender has learned from its mistakes though many developing countries are desperate for cash in the current credit environment , not everyone is looking forward to the prospect of a richer and emboldened imf .
bad reputation the organization 's reputation has suffered in many parts of the world due to a poor track record in managing past economic crises , including the asian crisis in the late 1990s and argentina 's economic collapse in early 2000 .
others blame the imf for exacerbating the economic problems of many poor countries by attaching policy conditions to loans that restrict spending and give countries little flexibility to tackle poverty .
until the current crisis , that reputation led many countries , particularly in asia and latin america , to shore up their own reserves and turn to neighbors and regional banks for help , instead .
" for the last 10 years , you 've seen the imf basically excluded from lending to almost all middle-income countries , " said mark weisbrot , co-director of the centre for economic and policy research .
" this is a very huge historic reversal that 's taking place . "
a collection of civil society groups on thursday called on the imf to " exit the development business " altogether and stick to its core responsibility of ensuring economic stability .
joanne carter , head of the results educational fund that joined in the civil society call , said the group was " deeply concerned " about the assumption that the imf should be a key player in the financial crisis .
" the imf has a long and unfortunate track record of policy conditions and guidance that have constrained the ability of countries ... to support domestically led development and to protect their vulnerable populations , " carter said .
developing countries shut out another part of the problem is that developing countries have struggled to gain a voice in the washington-based organization , created at the fabled bretton woods summit of 1944 , which refounded post-world war ii international financial structures .
both the imf and its sister organization , the world bank , are heavily controlled by the united states and europe .
efforts to reform the organizations ' voting procedures have only marginally shifted the balance of power .
strauss-kahn has said that the lender has learned from mistakes in past economic crises , and the imf has eased restrictions on some of its more recent loans .
the new short-term loan facility created last month has none of the usual policy conditions attached but will only be available to countries with a history of sound fiscal policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day will hopefully bring clear results in washington at the g20 world finance summit removing the usual conditions is a good step " in principle , " said robert weissman , director of essential action , an advocacy group that has been heavily critical of the imf in the past .
he warns that the imf could still be selective in choosing which countries get the new loans .
in other words , there may be an " implicit condition " that the country has followed imf policies in the past . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and what does unity mean ?
it is clear that the eu is not a federal state with unified state politics , but rather a group of countries .
" everyone agrees that it 's absolutely necessary that we coordinate with each other on economic policies in europe , " said french president and the current eu president nicolas sarkozy following the eu summit of the past week .

in the fourth such expulsion in three weeks , a 12-year-old schoolgirl was made to leave a train an hour 's ride from home because she could not pay a 40-euro fine .
passenger groups are leading the campaign to shame deutsche bahn after the embarrassing incidents made headlines across the country this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro bahn 's naumann is leading the criticism against db " it is purely foolish to react in such a way , " karl-peter naumann , director of the passenger organization pro bahn , told reuters .
" banishing them from the train is inhumane and causes unnecessary problems . "
the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .
in that expulsion , a 14-year-old was told to leave a train because her ticket was only valid later in the day .
but other reports of incidents previous to that soon came to light including the case of a 13-year-old child who had to carry her cello 5 km -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- home in the dark .
another documented incident involved a 12-year-old being dumped on a platform with no money or mobile phone .
deutsche bahn has since apologized and stated on wednesday that all its ticket inspectors would have to sign an agreement promising not to banish children from trains if travelling alone .
" everybody should know that it is unacceptable to throw children off the train , " a deutsche bahn spokesman told the taz daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche , the company ’ s primary shareholder had lobbied hard against the bill . the new legislation is an amendment to the 48-year-old " volkswagen law , " which protects the car manufacturer from takeover .
it had been struck down last year by the european union 's highest court .
berlin , however , on thursday , nov .
13 , ruled that the state of lower saxony would have veto rights at shareholder meetings that normally require a share stake of at least 25 percent .
home to volkswagen , lower saxony owns just over 20 percent of the company .
porsche , the company 's primary shareholder , will own just under 75 percent of the giant car manufacturer by next year .
a solid majority of legislators in germany 's bundestag lower house of parliament backed the bill , which is a welcome addition because the state is considered a guarantor of jobs at volkswagen , the largest industrial company in lower saxony .
eu vows action claiming the revised law violates eu rules on the free flow of capital however , the european commission is demanding that the law be scrapped .
" we will move ahead with the case in the next few weeks , " a commission spokesman said .
with the new law , lower saxony can block strategic decisions made by porsche , a move that the prestigious automobile brand has contested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel promised vw workers she would back the new bill in brussels porsche chief executive wendelin wiedeking wrote to legislators , predicting that law would cause future problems for berlin .
bernd osterloh , the labor leader at volkswagen , applauded the law however as a " grand signal " and claimed it is in full compliance with eu law .
merkel vows to defend new bill in a speech at the volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg in september , german chancellor angela merkel said that she believed the new law met eu demands and was adamant about defending the blocking minority clause in brussels .
thousands of vw workers have demonstrated in support of the law , which is also backed by christian wulff , lower saxony 's premier . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the fourth such expulsion in three weeks , a 12-year-old schoolgirl was made to leave a train an hour 's ride from home because she could not pay a 40-euro fine .
passenger groups are leading the campaign to shame deutsche bahn after the embarrassing incidents made headlines across the country this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro bahn 's naumann is leading the criticism against db " it is purely foolish to react in such a way , " karl-peter naumann , director of the passenger organization pro bahn , told reuters .
" banishing them from the train is inhumane and causes unnecessary problems . "
the first incident of inspectors ordering children off trains because they did not have the right tickets was reported by the german press on tuesday .
in that expulsion , a 14-year-old was told to leave a train because her ticket was only valid later in the day .
but other reports of incidents previous to that soon came to light including the case of a 13-year-old child who had to carry her cello 5 km -lrb- 3 miles -rrb- home in the dark .
another documented incident involved a 12-year-old being dumped on a platform with no money or mobile phone .
deutsche bahn has since apologized and stated on wednesday that all its ticket inspectors would have to sign an agreement promising not to banish children from trains if travelling alone .
" everybody should know that it is unacceptable to throw children off the train , " a deutsche bahn spokesman told the taz daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders announced that the december 2 summit would be preceded by a round of expert meetings on november 21-22 .
these would lay the ground work for negotiations on a new deal to replace an earlier partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- which was signed in 1997 .
russian and eu officials held the first round of talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement , " which is intended to give a legal framework to their relations in fields ranging from trade and investment to environmental protection and education , on july 4 .
despite the original pca duration lasting ten years , the 1997 document still governs eu-russia relations , since eu leaders decided to freeze talks on the new deal on september 1 in protest at russia 's august invasion of georgia .
however , the eu 's negotiating mandate also calls on the bloc to push for a solution to the so-called " frozen conflicts " in georgia and moldova which respects those countries ' sovereignty and territorial integrity .
diplomats admit that that will be a difficult challenge , given russia 's decision on august 26 to recognize the independence of the breakaway georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia .
sarkozy defends his record on georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with saakashvili during the conflict georgia was one of the main topics during the four-hour meeting during which sarkozy launched an impassioned defense of his efforts to end august 's russian-georgian war , accusing his critics of not having ideas and attacking the role of georgia 's allies , including the united states .
" if you consider the strategy of some of the ' friends of georgia ' -lrb- a group including the baltic states , poland , and ukraine -rrb- and the strategy of the eu , the eu one is far the better , " sarkozy said .
" agitation in the sea close to the conflict , with trouble threatened by certain military vessels , and an anti-missile shield wo n't be to the benefit of europe , russia or anyone else , " he said in a swipe at the deployment of us ships to the black sea during the august war and us plans to deploy a missile shield in central europe .
while he criticized russia 's invasion of georgia as " disproportionate , " he also stressed that it was a reaction to georgia 's attack on its breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - implying that the blame for the war lies in tbilisi .
and he condemned those detractors who said that his diplomacy had sacrificed georgia 's territorial integrity by leaving the question of the rebel provinces ' status open , saying that " those who criticize do n't have any better ideas . "
medvedev also accused georgia of " aggression " in the breakaway provinces and praised sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts to bring peace .
but the two presidents disagreed on the key question of whether russia has lived up to a six-point peace deal it signed on august 12 , and over russia 's controversial recognition of the breakaway zones ' independence .
the plan " has been accomplished fully and appropriately , " medvedev said .
russia has complied " very largely " with the peace plan , but " that means that some -lrb- conditions -rrb- have not been implemented , " sarkozy said .
leaders agree on freeze of missle deployments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has threatened to send his missiles to kaliningrad on the topic of the proposed us missile shield plan , which includes the deployment of interceptor missiles in poland and radar stations in the czech republic , both leaders agreed that russia and the united states should both refrain from deploying any new weapons systems in europe before a major summit of european and north american powers in june or july 2009 .
the 56-member organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- should meet in june or july 2009 , and " until then , please let 's have no more talk about the deployment of missiles or anti-missile protection systems , " sarkozy said .
" before a global agreement -lrb- on european security -rrb- , we should all refrain from unilateral steps that affect security in europe , " medvedev agreed .
over the last year , russia has repeatedly expressed outrage at us plans to site an anti-missile system on its borders .
on november 5 , medvedev threatened that russia would site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , across the border with poland and lithuania , if the us plans went ahead .
but in recent months , he has also called for " new security architecture " in europe that would set legal limits on the use of force across the continent .
in october , sarkozy said the idea was worth discussing , and that the osce , whose members include russia , the united states , canada and european states , should discuss it in late 2009 .
but on friday the two presidents " agreed that we do n't need to wait until the end of 2009 , we can do it in middle of the year on the basis of the osce , " medvedev said .
the eu , nato and the moscow-dominated commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and collective security treaty organization -lrb- csto -rrb- should also attend the summit , he said .
eu , russia reach almost identical financial positions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two powers moved closer on their financial policies as well as issues of defense , sarkozy and medvedev agreed almost identical positions on the financial crisis ahead of the g20 global summit in washington .
" i think i can say that russia 's propositions were of great quality and that they are very close to europe 's propositions , " sarkozy said .
" i 'm pleased to see the russian federation 's determination that some strong decisions be made at the washington summit , " he added .
medvedev agreed , saying that moscow and brussels were heading to washington with " practically common positions " .
he also backed sarkozy 's call for a second summit in february once us president-elect obama takes office .
while it seemed unlikely that europe and russia would arrive in washington with a joint blueprint , the two sides were moving closer together .
medvedev and sarkozy have blamed us economic management for a credit crunch that has brought down banks around the world , put the squeeze on businesses and consumers and pushed national economies into recession .
sarkozy has called for the summit of more than 20 of the world 's leading economies and emerging powers , to " remake the world financial system " , creating a so-called bretton woods ii .
an international conference at bretton woods , new hampshire , in 1944 to shape the post-world war ii financial system resulted in the creation of the world bank and the international monetary fund .
moscow has lobbied for change in the running of these bodies and , in particular , for more weight to be given to representatives of the so-called " bric " emerging nations , brazil , russia , india and china . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a bell rings and , with a crash , the starting gates snap open .
i am in beirut 's foret des pins , barely two kilometres from the islamist hezbollah movement 's heartland , and my money is down on robin hood in the opening race .
racing has been staged on this site since 1918 , and it is still one of the few places in the arab world legally to have a bet .
they might not vote in favour of it , but they are too clever to touch it general manager nabil nasrallah the field for this race has been reduced to four .
simple arithmetic suggests i have a 25 % chance of landing my bet , but the form guide in my hand is , as yet , undeciphered .
there is a lot of jostling at the first corner and one of the runners is pushed wide .
by the back straight they are getting strung out , and by the turn into the home straight there only looks like one winner .
it is robin hood , who coasts home well clear of why not .
i compare winning betting tickets with abu hani , who is in his 70s and a regular racegoer .
he shows me how to interpret the racecard , and offers advice on the next race .
i take it , and the horse wins .
working-class affair while we are shaking hands and celebrating , i ask him if he minds if i take a picture of him .
he says outside the racecourse would be fine , but he would rather not be photographed inside .
there are still some sensitivities surrounding gambling in lebanon , it seems .
enlarge image the horses here are all arab bred , rather than the thoroughbreds racing in most other countries .
there are about 450 horses in training in lebanon , which is not much by international standards , but this is the only racecourse .
many of the horses competing today are dappled greys , but there are also a few chestnuts and darker brown bays .
i am examining the runners for the next race , and ask the man beside me for his view .
" this one is half-dead , " he says .
" and that one is obviously crazy .
number four , shabab , will win . "
and it does .
television screens are showing footage from last night 's beirut race cup , one of the big events of the year .
the women are wearing elaborate hats and cocktail dresses ; the men are in suits .
today is a more working-class affair .
like most racecourses around the world , beirut has a grandstand and a members ' enclosure .
i am in the grandstand , where the racegoers are almost entirely male and over the age of 40 .
the beirut race cup is one of the highlights of the lebanese season frenetic betting returning to the parade ring , i am approached by another punter , who warns me about using my phone .
kamel says that mobiles are strictly forbidden inside the racecourse to prevent race-fixing .
i ask him how he is getting on and he breaks into a smile and says he is not winning today but that there are enough better days to keep him coming back .
after one popular result , some young men tear off their shirts and run around swinging them around their heads " i love coming .
it is an oasis here , " he says .
placing a bet is an immense crush though , with people climbing over each other to push their money through the window to the teller .
there are no independent bookmakers , just a state-run pooled betting system , similar to the tote in britain and ireland , or the pmu in france .
as the afternoon wears on , the betting seems to get more frenetic .
after one popular result , some young men tear off their shirts and run around the betting hall swinging them around their heads .
joseph , 65 , tells me he has been coming to the races in beirut since the 1960s .
he was working as a waiter and got to know some of the jockeys who used his hotel 's sauna to keep their weight down .
he got a few tips , started winning and began to take a closer interest .
when the lebanese civil war broke out in 1975 , racing continued although the course was close to some of the fiercest fighting and just beside the green line separating the christian east of beirut from the mainly muslim west .
important industry the racecourse general manager , nabil nasrallah , says it was one of the few places where people from both sides could mix freely during the war , without problems .
a day at the races is a reflection of deep-seated lebanese culture in 1982 though , the racecourse was hit by rockets during the israeli siege of west beirut .
the old grandstand was destroyed , and it was decided it was too dangerous for racing to continue .
the horses were mostly moved out of beirut , but there were few proper stud facilities and many died before they could be bred from .
some racehorses were imported later from iraq and egypt , but local horses with proven arab breeding were favoured .
joseph recalls one notorious case when a successful iraqi horse was thrown out because of doubts about the purity of its bloodline .
says mr nasrallah : " it is an industry that has a lot of history here , but there is not enough money coming in now .
" the big owners , with more than 100 horses , do not exist any more .
it is very expensive so we rely on small owners . "
joseph tells me there were regularly 20 runners in each race in the 1960s .
now it is more usual for there to be six or seven .
i ask mr nasrallah if the lebanese racing - and , by extension , gambling - industry has faced opposition from hezbollah or other conservative muslim organisations , but he tells me no senior figure has ever said they want to shut it down .
" they might not vote in favour of it , but they are too clever to touch it , " he says .
" we are working very freely . "
part of the reason is that many of those employed in racing , from the stable lads up , come from poorer , conservative areas .
minority pursuits there is also a wider issue .
our reporter was a bit baffled by the tip sheet at first , but he still cleaned up it is one of the more surprising aspects of lebanon that so many secular , liberal people are seemingly relaxed about an islamist movement becoming so powerful .
some say hezbollah , as shia muslims , are used to being a minority historically and are consequently tolerant of the activities of other minorities .
others believe that lebanese cultural life is so firmly entrenched that hezbollah would not be able to upset it , and probably would not dare try because of the ructions it would cause .
there are also those who suggest an economic motivation , saying that hezbollah is too smart to risk the damage to business and tourism if lebanon were to become a more islamic state .
and then there are sceptics - those who believe that hezbollah is concealing its real intentions as it accrues more power , and that lebanon is sleepwalking into changes of huge consequence .
the answer to that question lies some years in the future .
for the moment , there is just time for another bet and i force a handful of grubby notes through the betting window , backing mirsad at about 12-to-one .
he wins , giving me a 100 % record .
extraordinary , but it was just that kind of day .

in the summer of 1944 , delegates from 44 countries met in the midst of world war ii to reshape the world 's international financial system .
the location of the meeting - in the plush mount washington hotel in rural bretton woods , new hampshire - was designed to ensure that the delegates would have no distractions , and no pressure from lobbyists or congressmen , as they worked on their plans for post-war reconstruction .
the meeting was born out of the determination by us president franklin d roosevelt and uk prime minister winston churchill to ensure post-war prosperity through economic co-operation , avoiding the economic conflicts between countries in the 1930s that they believed contributed to the drift to war .
we have had to perform at one and the same time the tasks appropriate to the economist , to the financier , to the politician , to the journalist , to the propagandist , to the lawyer , to the statesman-even , i think , to the prophet and to the soothsayer john maynard keynes the principal negotiators at the meeting were the us , represented by the us treasury 's harry dexter white , and the uk 's john maynard keynes , who was serving as uk treasury adviser despite declining health .
and chairing the proceedings was henry morgenthau , the us treasury secretary , from the only country that was likely to emerge from the war with a strengthened economy .
president roosevelt told the conference : " the economic health of every country is a proper matter of concern to all its neighbours , near and distant . "
fixed exchange rates the uk 's john maynard keynes argued for a single world currency the meeting was part of the process led by the us to create a new international world order based on the rule of law , which also led to the creation of the united nations and the strengthening of other international organisations .
the delegates focused on two key issues : how to establish a stable system of exchange rates , and how to pay for rebuilding the war-damaged economies of europe .
and they established two international organisations to deal with these problems .
the international monetary fund was set up to enforce a set of fixed exchange rates that were linked to the dollar .
the wall street crash led to a decade of protectionism countries in balance of payments difficulties could receive short-term help from the imf to avoid devaluation , and it could sanction changes in exchange rates when necessary .
the world bank -lrb- officially the international bank for reconstruction and development -rrb- was set up to make long-term loans " facilitating the investment of capital for productive purposes , including the restoration of economies destroyed or disrupted by war -lsb- and -rsb- the reconversion of productive facilities to peacetime needs " .
post-war prosperity delegates wanted to encourage international trade and investment a third organisation , the international trade organisation , designed to encourage free trade , was still-born when the us refused to ratify its charter in 1947 - although tariff reductions were pursued through the gatt treaty later .
however , more ambitious proposals from the uk 's john maynard keynes to set up a world central bank which could issue its own currency -lrb- which he called bancor -rrb- were rejected by the us .
keynes hoped a new bank could help reflate the world economy by expanding the money supply .
he also wanted the cost of adjustment shared between countries with trade surpluses and deficits , so that countries with big surpluses would have to revalue their currencies , as well as deficit countries being forced to devalue .
instead , the bretton woods system gave the us currency - which was linked to gold - the dominant position in the world economy and allowed the us to run a trade deficit without having to devalue .
and the us , which contributed the most money to both institutions , also gained the most voting rights , giving it a veto over major policy decisions .
marshall plan the establishment of a rules-based system of international finance helped restore confidence in the world economy and led to an extraordinary boom in the post-war years .
the uk signed the bretton woods deal but soon found itself needing us aid the us also helped the european recovery by contributing additional funds through the marshall plan when the world bank 's efforts proved inadequate .
world trade among developed countries grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s , boosting world output and raising the standard of living , especially in europe and japan .
the us , still by far the richest country in the world , was happy to provide export markets for its allies , and sent dollars abroad through military and civilian aid which helped lubricate the wheels of commerce .
meanwhile , the focus of the world bank gradually shifted to helping developing countries with the establishment of its special low-interest loan arm , ida .
breakdown of bretton woods however , by the 1970s , the us currency was under pressure from a combination of factors , including the cost of the vietnam war and the growing trade deficit .
in 1971 , the us under president nixon unilaterally went off the gold standard and devalued the dollar , a move ratified by the smithsonian agreement later that year .
this led to the abandonment of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of floating rates , where the value of all the main currencies was determined by market trading .
attempts to forge a new bretton woods agreement on currencies in the 1970s failed , although the imf still retained its role of helping countries cope with major currency crises - including britain in 1976 .
the breakdown of bretton woods had two consequences .
on the one hand , it led european countries to begin seriously considering closer monetary co-operation , which ultimately led to the creation of the euro in 1999 .
and it led to the creation of the g7 , the informal group of the world 's leading economies , which helped to coordinate currency adjustment in the plaza and louvre accords in the 1980s .
financial globalisation on the other hand , the end of the bretton woods system unleashed two decades of financial globalisation , encouraged by the deregulation not just of currency markets , but also of rules about banking and investment .
this led to increased flows of private money to rich and poor countries alike , which helped boost growth but also created greater instability .
the rapid reversal of such private sector flows when currencies were threatened with devaluation was the central cause of the asian financial crisis in 1997-98 , which spread to russia and eventually argentina .
the resources of the imf proved inadequate to compensate for the run on their currencies , and the adjustment proved painful , with sharp falls in gdp .
since then , many asian countries , including china , have accumulated large currency reserves to insulate themselves against future crises , avoiding the need to call on the imf .
new global rules the latest world financial crisis , which has hit the richest countries hardest , has renewed calls for a new global framework of financial regulation .
but the task this time will be far more complex , with the proliferation of financial instruments and the fact that there is no longer one country that dominates the world economy in the way the us did after world war ii .
and the political impetus for co-operation is less compelling today than it was in 1944 , after a decade of war and depression .
any new agreement would have to recognise the power of the rising economies , such as china and india , and reshape the institutions created more than half a century ago .
such changes are not likely to be either quick or easy .

in the summer of 1944 , delegates from 44 countries met in the midst of world war ii to reshape the world 's international financial system .
the location of the meeting - in the plush mount washington hotel in rural bretton woods , new hampshire - was designed to ensure that the delegates would have no distractions , and no pressure from lobbyists or congressmen , as they worked on their plans for post-war reconstruction .
the meeting was born out of the determination by us president franklin d roosevelt and uk prime minister winston churchill to ensure post-war prosperity through economic co-operation , avoiding the economic conflicts between countries in the 1930s that they believed contributed to the drift to war .
we have had to perform at one and the same time the tasks appropriate to the economist , to the financier , to the politician , to the journalist , to the propagandist , to the lawyer , to the statesman-even , i think , to the prophet and to the soothsayer john maynard keynes the principal negotiators at the meeting were the us , represented by the us treasury 's harry dexter white , and the uk 's john maynard keynes , who was serving as uk treasury adviser despite declining health .
and chairing the proceedings was henry morgenthau , the us treasury secretary , from the only country that was likely to emerge from the war with a strengthened economy .
president roosevelt told the conference : " the economic health of every country is a proper matter of concern to all its neighbours , near and distant . "
fixed exchange rates the uk 's john maynard keynes argued for a single world currency the meeting was part of the process led by the us to create a new international world order based on the rule of law , which also led to the creation of the united nations and the strengthening of other international organisations .
the delegates focused on two key issues : how to establish a stable system of exchange rates , and how to pay for rebuilding the war-damaged economies of europe .
and they established two international organisations to deal with these problems .
the international monetary fund was set up to enforce a set of fixed exchange rates that were linked to the dollar .
the wall street crash led to a decade of protectionism countries in balance of payments difficulties could receive short-term help from the imf to avoid devaluation , and it could sanction changes in exchange rates when necessary .
the world bank -lrb- officially the international bank for reconstruction and development -rrb- was set up to make long-term loans " facilitating the investment of capital for productive purposes , including the restoration of economies destroyed or disrupted by war -lsb- and -rsb- the reconversion of productive facilities to peacetime needs " .
post-war prosperity delegates wanted to encourage international trade and investment a third organisation , the international trade organisation , designed to encourage free trade , was still-born when the us refused to ratify its charter in 1947 - although tariff reductions were pursued through the gatt treaty later .
however , more ambitious proposals from the uk 's john maynard keynes to set up a world central bank which could issue its own currency -lrb- which he called bancor -rrb- were rejected by the us .
keynes hoped a new bank could help reflate the world economy by expanding the money supply .
he also wanted the cost of adjustment shared between countries with trade surpluses and deficits , so that countries with big surpluses would have to revalue their currencies , as well as deficit countries being forced to devalue .
instead , the bretton woods system gave the us currency - which was linked to gold - the dominant position in the world economy and allowed the us to run a trade deficit without having to devalue .
and the us , which contributed the most money to both institutions , also gained the most voting rights , giving it a veto over major policy decisions .
marshall plan the establishment of a rules-based system of international finance helped restore confidence in the world economy and led to an extraordinary boom in the post-war years .
the uk signed the bretton woods deal but soon found itself needing us aid the us also helped the european recovery by contributing additional funds through the marshall plan when the world bank 's efforts proved inadequate .
world trade among developed countries grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s , boosting world output and raising the standard of living , especially in europe and japan .
the us , still by far the richest country in the world , was happy to provide export markets for its allies , and sent dollars abroad through military and civilian aid which helped lubricate the wheels of commerce .
meanwhile , the focus of the world bank gradually shifted to helping developing countries with the establishment of its special low-interest loan arm , ida .
breakdown of bretton woods however , by the 1970s , the us currency was under pressure from a combination of factors , including the cost of the vietnam war and the growing trade deficit .
in 1971 , the us under president nixon unilaterally went off the gold standard and devalued the dollar , a move ratified by the smithsonian agreement later that year .
this led to the abandonment of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of floating rates , where the value of all the main currencies was determined by market trading .
attempts to forge a new bretton woods agreement on currencies in the 1970s failed , although the imf still retained its role of helping countries cope with major currency crises - including britain in 1976 .
the breakdown of bretton woods had two consequences .
on the one hand , it led european countries to begin seriously considering closer monetary co-operation , which ultimately led to the creation of the euro in 1999 .
and it led to the creation of the g7 , the informal group of the world 's leading economies , which helped to coordinate currency adjustment in the plaza and louvre accords in the 1980s .
financial globalisation on the other hand , the end of the bretton woods system unleashed two decades of financial globalisation , encouraged by the deregulation not just of currency markets , but also of rules about banking and investment .
this led to increased flows of private money to rich and poor countries alike , which helped boost growth but also created greater instability .
the rapid reversal of such private sector flows when currencies were threatened with devaluation was the central cause of the asian financial crisis in 1997-98 , which spread to russia and eventually argentina .
the resources of the imf proved inadequate to compensate for the run on their currencies , and the adjustment proved painful , with sharp falls in gdp .
since then , many asian countries , including china , have accumulated large currency reserves to insulate themselves against future crises , avoiding the need to call on the imf .
new global rules the latest world financial crisis , which has hit the richest countries hardest , has renewed calls for a new global framework of financial regulation .
but the task this time will be far more complex , with the proliferation of financial instruments and the fact that there is no longer one country that dominates the world economy in the way the us did after world war ii .
and the political impetus for co-operation is less compelling today than it was in 1944 , after a decade of war and depression .
any new agreement would have to recognise the power of the rising economies , such as china and india , and reshape the institutions created more than half a century ago .
such changes are not likely to be either quick or easy .

the world bank -lrb- officially the international bank for reconstruction and development -rrb- was set up to make long-term loans " facilitating the investment of capital for productive purposes , including the restoration of economies destroyed or disrupted by war -lsb- and -rsb- the reconversion of productive facilities to peacetime needs " .
post-war prosperity a third organisation , the international trade organisation , designed to encourage free trade , was still-born when the us refused to ratify its charter in 1947 - although tariff reductions were pursued through the gatt treaty later .
however , more ambitious proposals from the uk 's john maynard keynes to set up a world central bank which could issue its own currency -lrb- which he called bancor -rrb- were rejected by the us .
keynes hoped a new bank could help reflate the world economy by expanding the money supply .
he also wanted the cost of adjustment shared between countries with trade surpluses and deficits , so that countries with big surpluses would have to revalue their currencies , as well as deficit countries being forced to devalue .
instead , the bretton woods system gave the us currency - which was linked to gold - the dominant position in the world economy and allowed the us to run a trade deficit without having to devalue .
and the us , which contributed the most money to both institutions , also gained the most voting rights , giving it a veto over major policy decisions .
marshall plan the establishment of a rules-based system of international finance helped restore confidence in the world economy and led to an extraordinary boom in the post-war years .
the us also helped the european recovery by contributing additional funds through the marshall plan when the world bank 's efforts proved inadequate .
world trade among developed countries grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s , boosting world output and raising the standard of living , especially in europe and japan .
the us , still by far the richest country in the world , was happy to provide export markets for its allies , and sent dollars abroad through military and civilian aid which helped lubricate the wheels of commerce .
meanwhile , the focus of the world bank gradually shifted to helping developing countries with the establishment of its special low-interest loan arm , ida .
breakdown of bretton woods however , by the 1970s , the us currency was under pressure from a combination of factors , including the cost of the vietnam war and the growing trade deficit .
in 1971 , the us under president nixon unilaterally went off the gold standard and devalued the dollar , a move ratified by the smithsonian agreement later that year .
this led to the abandonment of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of floating rates , where the value of all the main currencies was determined by market trading .
attempts to forge a new bretton woods agreement on currencies in the 1970s failed , although the imf still retained its role of helping countries cope with major currency crises - including britain in 1976 .
the breakdown of bretton woods had two consequences .
on the one hand , it led european countries to begin seriously considering closer monetary co-operation , which ultimately led to the creation of the euro in 1999 .
and it led to the creation of the g7 , the informal group of the world 's leading economies , which helped to coordinate currency adjustment in the plaza and louvre accords in the 1980s .
financial globalisation on the other hand , the end of the bretton woods system unleashed two decades of financial globalisation , encouraged by the deregulation not just of currency markets , but also of rules about banking and investment .
this led to increased flows of private money to rich and poor countries alike , which helped boost growth but also created greater instability .
the rapid reversal of such private sector flows when currencies were threatened with devaluation was the central cause of the asian financial crisis in 1997-98 , which spread to russia and eventually argentina .
the resources of the imf proved inadequate to compensate for the run on their currencies , and the adjustment proved painful , with sharp falls in gdp .
since then , many asian countries , including china , have accumulated large currency reserves to insulate themselves against future crises , avoiding the need to call on the imf .
new global rules the latest world financial crisis , which has hit the richest countries hardest , has renewed calls for a new global framework of financial regulation .
but the task this time will be far more complex , with the proliferation of financial instruments and the fact that there is no longer one country that dominates the world economy in the way the us did after world war ii .
and the political impetus for co-operation is less compelling today than it was in 1944 , after a decade of war and depression .
any new agreement would have to recognise the power of the rising economies , such as china and india , and reshape the institutions created more than half a century ago .
such changes are not likely to be either quick or easy .

under taleban rule between 1997 and 2001 afghans lived in a highly restrictive society governed by islamic sharia law .
executions by beheading were frequent , girls and women were banned from education , and music was among the many " western " influences banned by the mullahs who ran the country .
however , mr mujahid told the bbc that the taleban had now stopped beheadings and were educating girls in areas under their control .
he denied they were behind this week 's acid attack on schoolgirls in kandahar .
the spokesman denied his movement financed itself from the drugs trade , a statement our correspondent says is unlikely to be taken seriously in western capitals .
he criticised the us for attacking afghanistan in 2001 , and said there was no proof that osama bin laden was behind the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
al-qaeda , he said , had been brought to afghanistan by the americans , not by the taleban .
he said he had no idea where osama bin laden was but did confirm that the taleban leader , mullah omar - who has not been seen since 2001 - was hiding " in a secure place " .

executions by beheading were frequent , girls and women were banned from education , and music was among the many " western " influences banned by the mullahs who ran the country .
however , mr mujahid told the bbc that the taleban had now stopped beheadings and were educating girls in areas under their control .
he denied they were behind this week 's acid attack on schoolgirls in kandahar .
the spokesman denied his movement financed itself from the drugs trade , a statement our correspondent says is unlikely to be taken seriously in western capitals .
he criticised the us for attacking afghanistan in 2001 , and said there was no proof that osama bin laden was behind the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
al-qaeda , he said , had been brought to afghanistan by the americans , not by the taleban .
he said he had no idea where osama bin laden was but did confirm that the taleban leader , mullah omar - who has not been seen since 2001 - was hiding " in a secure place " .

karzai : afghan government needs to do " a million times better " he said the taleban now controlled more than half of afghanistan , and were running those areas in a more tolerant fashion than in previous years .
under taleban rule between 1997 and 2001 afghans lived in a highly restrictive society governed by islamic sharia law .
executions by beheading were frequent , girls and women were banned from education , and music was among the many " western " influences banned by the mullahs who ran the country .
however , mr mujahid told the bbc that the taleban had now stopped beheadings and were educating girls in areas under their control .
he denied they were behind this week 's acid attack on schoolgirls in kandahar .
the spokesman denied his movement financed itself from the drugs trade , a statement our correspondent says is unlikely to be taken seriously in western capitals .
he criticised the us for attacking afghanistan in 2001 , and said there was no proof that osama bin laden was behind the 9/11 attacks on new york and washington .
al-qaeda , he said , had been brought to afghanistan by the americans , not by the taleban .
he said he had no idea where osama bin laden was but did confirm that the taleban leader , mullah omar - who has not been seen since 2001 - was hiding " in a secure place " .

" i miss her , but i hope she is having a good life , " he says sadly .
five years ago , john 's sister died in some of the worst fighting in liberia 's brutal 14-year civil war , leaving a new-born baby in his care .
john named the baby faith and prayed for her survival .
but , with three children of his own and no job , he struggled .
when an elder in his church said she knew of a charity which would feed and educate faith , he agreed to hand her over , believing he could still have contact with his niece .
there is no chance of that .
because today baby faith has a new name and a new life with an adoptive family in the us .
around 600 children like her have been adopted from liberia to north america in the last two years alone .
john is adamant his niece was adopted overseas without his consent .
" we did not talk about adoption , " he says .
" for me as a parent , as an uncle i still want to have access to her .
i do n't want her to be with another person .
it is not what we discussed . "
exploited that is not unusual according to liberian child welfare specialist jeremliak piah .
" most of the people who commit their children for adoption do not really understand what adoption is .
they did not understand that adoption meant relinquishing ownership of your child . "
he also says the agencies deliberately target the illiterate .
" they do n't read and that is why in most cases they come back and say : ' yes , i remember i put my fingerprint on something but i did n't know exactly what i was putting my fingerprint on ' . "
and the agencies exploit out-dated legislation .
in recent years , inter-country adoption has been governed by stringent international guidelines like the hague convention - designed to prevent trafficking and ensure adoption is in the best interest of the child .
liberia has not signed up to the convention .
liberia 's adoption laws were written in the 1950s and deal only with domestic cases .
they make no mention of inter-country adoptions .
that loophole opens the door for anyone to set themselves up as a private adoption business and to operate with near impunity .
in a bid to crack down on this fast-growing trade , the liberian government has imposed a moratorium on all new adoptions .
but it is not working .
' full swing ' posing as a couple seeking to adopt to canada , we went undercover to meet self-styled bishop ed kofi - who runs one of the largest private children 's homes in monrovia from which around 100 children have been adopted in recent years . "
if you have liberian children being marketed like this it 's a shame .
it is a shame " vabah gayflor minister for gender mr kofi bragged that the adoption business is in " full swing " , and promised that for $ 5,000 he could arrange an adoption .
having met us just twice , he also offered to deliver a child to us - something which flouts all international guidelines on child protection .
later , when we revealed our true identities , he sat down to talk with us and was unapologetic about continuing his business , despite the ban .
he shrugged off concerns about child welfare as " rumours " .
most of the children in orphanages like the one mr kofi runs are not actually orphans .
most have at least one living parent , many were placed there by desperately poor parents .
degrading treatment unscrupulous agents go into shanty towns and slum villages , convincing parents to give up their children on the promise of free room and board and a good education - something few families can afford .
it is an offer hard to turn down , but it is also too good to be true .
most of the orphanages where the children are housed fall well below minimum standards .
a un report published in 2007 documented rampant abuse and neglect and " inhuman and degrading treatment of children " .
since the end of the war the number of private orphanages has tripled - from 40 to 120 .
there is a simple reason for that - it is a business .
orphanage owners receive a state subsidy for each child they take .
and some of those children can then be adopted internationally for fees as high as $ 15,000 .
but , in a country where corruption can be endemic , many choose to look away .
vabah gayflor , minister for gender , and one of the most influential women in cabinet , is one who does not : " many of these institutions have been established by people who are exploiting .
people are getting scores of money out of this and they want to make sure that they stay in business , " she says .
" if you have liberian children being marketed like this it 's a shame .
it is a shame . "

five years ago , john 's sister died in some of the worst fighting in liberia 's brutal 14-year civil war , leaving a new-born baby in his care .
john named the baby faith and prayed for her survival .
but , with three children of his own and no job , he struggled .
when an elder in his church said she knew of a charity which would feed and educate faith , he agreed to hand her over , believing he could still have contact with his niece .
there is no chance of that .
because today baby faith has a new name and a new life with an adoptive family in the us .
around 600 children like her have been adopted from liberia to north america in the last two years alone .
john is adamant his niece was adopted overseas without his consent .
" we did not talk about adoption , " he says .
" for me as a parent , as an uncle i still want to have access to her .
i do n't want her to be with another person .
it is not what we discussed . "
exploited that is not unusual according to liberian child welfare specialist jeremliak piah .
ed kofi bragged the adoption business is in ' full swing ' " most of the people who commit their children for adoption do not really understand what adoption is .
they did not understand that adoption meant relinquishing ownership of your child . "
he also says the agencies deliberately target the illiterate .
" they do n't read and that is why in most cases they come back and say : ' yes , i remember i put my fingerprint on something but i did n't know exactly what i was putting my fingerprint on ' . "
and the agencies exploit out-dated legislation .
in recent years , inter-country adoption has been governed by stringent international guidelines like the hague convention - designed to prevent trafficking and ensure adoption is in the best interest of the child .
liberia has not signed up to the convention .
liberia 's adoption laws were written in the 1950s and deal only with domestic cases .
they make no mention of inter-country adoptions .
that loophole opens the door for anyone to set themselves up as a private adoption business and to operate with near impunity .
in a bid to crack down on this fast-growing trade , the liberian government has imposed a moratorium on all new adoptions .
but it is not working .
' full swing ' posing as a couple seeking to adopt to canada , we went undercover to meet self-styled bishop ed kofi - who runs one of the largest private children 's homes in monrovia from which around 100 children have been adopted in recent years .
if you have liberian children being marketed like this it 's a shame .
it is a shame vabah gayflor minister for gender mr kofi bragged that the adoption business is in " full swing " , and promised that for $ 5,000 he could arrange an adoption .
having met us just twice , he also offered to deliver a child to us - something which flouts all international guidelines on child protection .
later , when we revealed our true identities , he sat down to talk with us and was unapologetic about continuing his business , despite the ban .
he shrugged off concerns about child welfare as " rumours " .
most of the children in orphanages like the one mr kofi runs are not actually orphans .
most have at least one living parent , many were placed there by desperately poor parents .
degrading treatment unscrupulous agents go into shanty towns and slum villages , convincing parents to give up their children on the promise of free room and board and a good education - something few families can afford .
it is an offer hard to turn down , but it is also too good to be true .
most of the orphanages where the children are housed fall well below minimum standards .
a un report published in 2007 documented rampant abuse and neglect and " inhuman and degrading treatment of children " .
since the end of the war the number of private orphanages has tripled - from 40 to 120 .
there is a simple reason for that - it is a business .
orphanage owners receive a state subsidy for each child they take .
and some of those children can then be adopted internationally for fees as high as $ 15,000 .
but , in a country where corruption can be endemic , many choose to look away .
vabah gayflor , minister for gender , and one of the most influential women in cabinet , is one who does not : " many of these institutions have been established by people who are exploiting .
people are getting scores of money out of this and they want to make sure that they stay in business , " she says .
" if you have liberian children being marketed like this it 's a shame .
it is a shame . "

john varkpola 's niece was adopted without his consent " i miss her , but i hope she is having a good life , " he says sadly .
five years ago , john 's sister died in some of the worst fighting in liberia 's brutal 14-year civil war , leaving a new-born baby in his care .
john named the baby faith and prayed for her survival .
but , with three children of his own and no job , he struggled .
when an elder in his church said she knew of a charity which would feed and educate faith , he agreed to hand her over , believing he could still have contact with his niece .
there is no chance of that .
because today baby faith has a new name and a new life with an adoptive family in the us .
around 600 children like her have been adopted from liberia to north america in the last two years alone .
john is adamant his niece was adopted overseas without his consent .
" we did not talk about adoption , " he says .
" for me as a parent , as an uncle i still want to have access to her .
i do n't want her to be with another person .
it is not what we discussed . "
exploited that is not unusual according to liberian child welfare specialist jeremliak piah .
ed kofi bragged the adoption business is in ' full swing ' " most of the people who commit their children for adoption do not really understand what adoption is .
they did not understand that adoption meant relinquishing ownership of your child . "
he also says the agencies deliberately target the illiterate .
" they do n't read and that is why in most cases they come back and say : ' yes , i remember i put my fingerprint on something but i did n't know exactly what i was putting my fingerprint on ' . "
and the agencies exploit out-dated legislation .
in recent years , inter-country adoption has been governed by stringent international guidelines like the hague convention - designed to prevent trafficking and ensure adoption is in the best interest of the child .
liberia has not signed up to the convention .
liberia 's adoption laws were written in the 1950s and deal only with domestic cases .
they make no mention of inter-country adoptions .
that loophole opens the door for anyone to set themselves up as a private adoption business and to operate with near impunity .
in a bid to crack down on this fast-growing trade , the liberian government has imposed a moratorium on all new adoptions .
but it is not working .
' full swing ' posing as a couple seeking to adopt to canada , we went undercover to meet self-styled bishop ed kofi - who runs one of the largest private children 's homes in monrovia from which around 100 children have been adopted in recent years .
if you have liberian children being marketed like this it 's a shame .
it is a shame vabah gayflor minister for gender mr kofi bragged that the adoption business is in " full swing " , and promised that for $ 5,000 he could arrange an adoption .
having met us just twice , he also offered to deliver a child to us - something which flouts all international guidelines on child protection .
later , when we revealed our true identities , he sat down to talk with us and was unapologetic about continuing his business , despite the ban .
he shrugged off concerns about child welfare as " rumours " .
most of the children in orphanages like the one mr kofi runs are not actually orphans .
most have at least one living parent , many were placed there by desperately poor parents .
degrading treatment unscrupulous agents go into shanty towns and slum villages , convincing parents to give up their children on the promise of free room and board and a good education - something few families can afford .
it is an offer hard to turn down , but it is also too good to be true .
most of the orphanages where the children are housed fall well below minimum standards .
a un report published in 2007 documented rampant abuse and neglect and " inhuman and degrading treatment of children " .
since the end of the war the number of private orphanages has tripled - from 40 to 120 .
there is a simple reason for that - it is a business .
orphanage owners receive a state subsidy for each child they take .
and some of those children can then be adopted internationally for fees as high as $ 15,000 .
but , in a country where corruption can be endemic , many choose to look away .
vabah gayflor , minister for gender , and one of the most influential women in cabinet , is one who does not : " many of these institutions have been established by people who are exploiting .
people are getting scores of money out of this and they want to make sure that they stay in business , " she says .
" if you have liberian children being marketed like this it 's a shame .
it is a shame . "

the crawley mp has the most marginal constituency of anyone in the house of commons - having won it by just 37 votes at the last general election .
far from wanting to forget her predicament , she had the number tattooed onto her left foot , under a " new labour " rose symbol .
mrs moffatt told the bbc : " having told my sons never , ever get a tattoo , i decided to get one .
" it 's a good reminder , and it 's a bit of fun .
the number 37 also means more than when your majority is in the thousands - it focuses attention . "
mrs moffatt , a former haematology nurse , first took crawley , in west sussex , in the 1997 election , by more than 11,700 votes .
re-counts the majority fell to 6,770 in 2001 before its more recent shrinkage to near non-existence .
the 2005 vote was so close that it took what mrs moffatt calls " four-and-a-half " recounts before her conservative rival conceded defeat .
the tattoo could have a companion after the next election when this finally happened , she burst into tears .
the 54-year-old mother-of-three said : " the last election meant much more to me even than the 1997 one .
" i was awake for 40 hours campaigning and then waiting for the re-counts .
if anybody goes through that they would cry too .
" but i was ahead for all the recounts .
at one stage it seemed like i had a majority of 35 , but they found two more votes . "
mrs moffatt has seen both sides of elections , having lost out to conservative nicholas soames - " a perfect gentleman throughout the contest " - in 1992 .
' feels like rejection ' she said : " i thought in 1992 ' let 's have a go ' .
and i thought afterwards ' i 'm never doing that again ' .
" it was a bit like childbirth .
i thought i would never do it again and i 've done it three more times .
" but even if you expect to lose , losing is hard .
it feels like rejection . "
there was a lot of hurt over the war ...
it was the most difficult vote i have ever had to decide on laura moffatt the build-up to polling day does not sound like much fun , either .
" i 've got myself down before every election .
i 'm just the worst person in the world for that .
" in many ways i 'm quite fortunate , in that i would quite like to go back to my old job , but i 've had an amazing time here .
" it may be a labour thing , thinking it ca n't last .
the tories have a sense that they are born to rule and we do n't .
" it 's often true that the opposition gets a bit of an easy run .
but , rather than everyone just accepting things , there seems to be more and more investigation of what the tories stand for .
" i think people might think a bit differently when they start to think about them in more detail . "
' not driving desire ' crawley is one of the constituencies in south-eastern england that david cameron 's conservatives will be fighting hard to win .
the party is currently enjoying a lead in the national opinion polls which , if translated to the local level , would put mrs moffatt out of a job .
she is promising to work tirelessly to keep her seat , but says she will not run again for parliament if she loses .
" i think we can turn it around and beat the tories next time round , but it 's not been my driving desire to be an mp .
" if i lost i would do a back-to-work course .
it 's a transformed national health service - unrecognisable from when i was a nurse and the tories were in power .
i would like to work in it now .
" i 've just done three weeks ' voluntary service in sierra leone .
if anyone says we have a third-world health service , i get quite angry because they do n't know what they 're talking about . "
mrs moffatt 's husband works at gatwick , crawley 's biggest employer however , mrs moffatt feels labour , under tony blair and gordon brown , has failed to trumpet its achievements .
" i still live on the same estate i lived on 30 years ago .
i 've seen people who have had their lives transformed by improvements in help with childcare .
it 's the same in schools - so many of them used to be so hopeless , so directionless .
there 's such a difference .
" i do n't know what we can do about possible boredom with our party , but you have to remind people that change for the better has n't come about by chance or accident .
it is people sitting in parliament .
we have to remind people what we 've done . "
unusually for an mp , mrs moffatt is genuinely " local " .
she grew up in crawley , studied there , worked in the local hospital and served on the council , becoming mayor .
top-up fees she commutes to london each day , having at one time rented a flat near parliament , which she did not like .
mrs moffatt 's husband is a shift-working engineer at gatwick airport , by far the biggest source of employment in her constituency .
as parliamentary private secretary to the then higher education minister alan johnson , she helped get top-up fees for university students through the house of commons .
mrs moffatt says she " absolutely " still supports the policy , which angered many labour supporters .
more significantly , for an mp with a large muslim population within her constituency , she voted in 2003 in favour of the iraq war .
might it have cost mrs moffatt some votes ?
' harder than nursing ' she said : " there was a lot of hurt over the war and i had a lot of discussions and visited mosques to talk about it .
" it was the most difficult vote i have ever had to decide on .
i feel it was right now , but at times i wondered .
" being an mp is harder than being a nurse .
at least when we did 12 hours at work we knew it was someone else 's job for a bit now .
in this job you always feel you have n't done quite enough .
" i suppose most mps would say their work level has gone up over the last 11 years , but i think i worked just as hard when i had an 11,000 majority . "
mrs moffatt , a cheerful woman who enjoys office banter with her staff , likes to think her minimal majority has enlivened the atmosphere in crawley .
' more relevant ' she said : " it makes people more involved in politics .
people are talking about politics more .
" when i go and speak at schools in my constituency and i tell children about the size of the majority it makes things more relevant to them .
" but you ca n't think about your majority every second of the day .
you just have to get on with the job .
" people think i 've got ' yes tourette 's ' because i keep saying ' yes ' to things .
but it 's because i like to follow through with things , not because i 'm changing my style as an mp .
" i ca n't change the way i am , like chasing the youth vote in a cheesy way in an effort to win .
if a 54-year-old woman tried getting down with the kids it would seem wrong . "
might her " body art " give her a certain cache with crawley 's young , though ?
mrs moffatt said : " it 's been reported in the press that , if i win next time , and increase my majority , i 'd like to get a tattoo in a bigger place - my backside .
" i think another number on the same foot as the old one might be more appropriate . "

' not driving desire ' crawley is one of the constituencies in south-eastern england that david cameron 's conservatives will be fighting hard to win .
the party is currently enjoying a lead in the national opinion polls which , if translated to the local level , would put mrs moffatt out of a job .
she is promising to work tirelessly to keep her seat , but says she will not run again for parliament if she loses .
" i think we can turn it around and beat the tories next time round , but it 's not been my driving desire to be an mp .

mrs moffatt 's husband works at gatwick , crawley 's biggest employer however , mrs moffatt feels labour , under tony blair and gordon brown , has failed to trumpet its achievements .
" i still live on the same estate i lived on 30 years ago .
i 've seen people who have had their lives transformed by improvements in help with childcare .
it 's the same in schools - so many of them used to be so hopeless , so directionless .
there 's such a difference .
" i do n't know what we can do about possible boredom with our party , but you have to remind people that change for the better has n't come about by chance or accident .

we have to remind people what we 've done . "
unusually for an mp , mrs moffatt is genuinely " local " .
she grew up in crawley , studied there , worked in the local hospital and served on the council , becoming mayor .
top-up fees she commutes to london each day , having at one time rented a flat near parliament , which she did not like .
mrs moffatt 's husband is a shift-working engineer at gatwick airport , by far the biggest source of employment in her constituency .
as parliamentary private secretary to the then higher education minister alan johnson , she helped get top-up fees for university students through the house of commons .
mrs moffatt says she " absolutely " still supports the policy , which angered many labour supporters .
more significantly , for an mp with a large muslim population within her constituency , she voted in 2003 in favour of the iraq war .
might it have cost mrs moffatt some votes ?
' harder than nursing ' she said : " there was a lot of hurt over the war and i had a lot of discussions and visited mosques to talk about it .
" it was the most difficult vote i have ever had to decide on .
i feel it was right now , but at times i wondered .
" being an mp is harder than being a nurse .
at least when we did 12 hours at work we knew it was someone else 's job for a bit now .
in this job you always feel you have n't done quite enough .
" i suppose most mps would say their work level has gone up over the last 11 years , but i think i worked just as hard when i had an 11,000 majority . "
mrs moffatt , a cheerful woman who enjoys office banter with her staff , likes to think her minimal majority has enlivened the atmosphere in crawley .
' more relevant ' she said : " it makes people more involved in politics .
people are talking about politics more .
" when i go and speak at schools in my constituency and i tell children about the size of the majority it makes things more relevant to them .
" but you ca n't think about your majority every second of the day .
you just have to get on with the job .
" people think i 've got ' yes tourette 's ' because i keep saying ' yes ' to things .
but it 's because i like to follow through with things , not because i 'm changing my style as an mp .
" i ca n't change the way i am , like chasing the youth vote in a cheesy way in an effort to win .
if a 54-year-old woman tried getting down with the kids it would seem wrong . "
might her " body art " give her a certain cache with crawley 's young , though ?
mrs moffatt said : " it 's been reported in the press that , if i win next time , and increase my majority , i 'd like to get a tattoo in a bigger place - my backside .
" i think another number on the same foot as the old one might be more appropriate . "

the crawley mp has the most marginal constituency of anyone in the house of commons - having won it by just 37 votes at the last general election .
far from wanting to forget her predicament , she had the number tattooed onto her left foot , under a " new labour " rose symbol .
mrs moffatt told the bbc : " having told my sons never , ever get a tattoo , i decided to get one .
" it 's a good reminder , and it 's a bit of fun .
the number 37 also means more than when your majority is in the thousands - it focuses attention . "
mrs moffatt , a former haematology nurse , first took crawley , in west sussex , in the 1997 election , by more than 11,700 votes .
re-counts the majority fell to 6,770 in 2001 before its more recent shrinkage to near non-existence .
the 2005 vote was so close that it took what mrs moffatt calls " four-and-a-half " recounts before her conservative rival conceded defeat .
the tattoo could have a companion after the next election when this finally happened , she burst into tears .
the 54-year-old mother-of-three said : " the last election meant much more to me even than the 1997 one .
" i was awake for 40 hours campaigning and then waiting for the re-counts .
if anybody goes through that they would cry too .
" but i was ahead for all the recounts .
at one stage it seemed like i had a majority of 35 , but they found two more votes . "
mrs moffatt has seen both sides of elections , having lost out to conservative nicholas soames - " a perfect gentleman throughout the contest " - in 1992 .
' feels like rejection ' she said : " i thought in 1992 ' let 's have a go ' .
and i thought afterwards ' i 'm never doing that again ' .

" i 've got myself down before every election .
i 'm just the worst person in the world for that .
" in many ways i 'm quite fortunate , in that i would quite like to go back to my old job , but i 've had an amazing time here .
" it may be a labour thing , thinking it ca n't last .
the tories have a sense that they are born to rule and we do n't .
" it 's often true that the opposition gets a bit of an easy run .
but , rather than everyone just accepting things , there seems to be more and more investigation of what the tories stand for .
" i think people might think a bit differently when they start to think about them in more detail . "
' not driving desire ' crawley is one of the constituencies in south-eastern england that david cameron 's conservatives will be fighting hard to win .
the party is currently enjoying a lead in the national opinion polls which , if translated to the local level , would put mrs moffatt out of a job .
she is promising to work tirelessly to keep her seat , but says she will not run again for parliament if she loses .
" i think we can turn it around and beat the tories next time round , but it 's not been my driving desire to be an mp .
" if i lost i would do a back-to-work course .
it 's a transformed national health service - unrecognisable from when i was a nurse and the tories were in power .
i would like to work in it now .
" i 've just done three weeks ' voluntary service in sierra leone .
if anyone says we have a third-world health service , i get quite angry because they do n't know what they 're talking about . "
mrs moffatt 's husband works at gatwick , crawley 's biggest employer however , mrs moffatt feels labour , under tony blair and gordon brown , has failed to trumpet its achievements .
" i still live on the same estate i lived on 30 years ago .
i 've seen people who have had their lives transformed by improvements in help with childcare .
it 's the same in schools - so many of them used to be so hopeless , so directionless .
there 's such a difference .
" i do n't know what we can do about possible boredom with our party , but you have to remind people that change for the better has n't come about by chance or accident .
it is people sitting in parliament .
we have to remind people what we 've done . "
unusually for an mp , mrs moffatt is genuinely " local " .
she grew up in crawley , studied there , worked in the local hospital and served on the council , becoming mayor .
top-up fees she commutes to london each day , having at one time rented a flat near parliament , which she did not like .
mrs moffatt 's husband is a shift-working engineer at gatwick airport , by far the biggest source of employment in her constituency .
as parliamentary private secretary to the then higher education minister alan johnson , she helped get top-up fees for university students through the house of commons .
mrs moffatt says she " absolutely " still supports the policy , which angered many labour supporters .
more significantly , for an mp with a large muslim population within her constituency , she voted in 2003 in favour of the iraq war .
might it have cost mrs moffatt some votes ?
' harder than nursing ' she said : " there was a lot of hurt over the war and i had a lot of discussions and visited mosques to talk about it .
" it was the most difficult vote i have ever had to decide on .
i feel it was right now , but at times i wondered .
" being an mp is harder than being a nurse .
at least when we did 12 hours at work we knew it was someone else 's job for a bit now .
in this job you always feel you have n't done quite enough .
" i suppose most mps would say their work level has gone up over the last 11 years , but i think i worked just as hard when i had an 11,000 majority . "
mrs moffatt , a cheerful woman who enjoys office banter with her staff , likes to think her minimal majority has enlivened the atmosphere in crawley .
' more relevant ' she said : " it makes people more involved in politics .
people are talking about politics more .
" when i go and speak at schools in my constituency and i tell children about the size of the majority it makes things more relevant to them .
" but you ca n't think about your majority every second of the day .
you just have to get on with the job .
" people think i 've got ' yes tourette 's ' because i keep saying ' yes ' to things .
but it 's because i like to follow through with things , not because i 'm changing my style as an mp .
" i ca n't change the way i am , like chasing the youth vote in a cheesy way in an effort to win .
if a 54-year-old woman tried getting down with the kids it would seem wrong . "
might her " body art " give her a certain cache with crawley 's young , though ?
mrs moffatt said : " it 's been reported in the press that , if i win next time , and increase my majority , i 'd like to get a tattoo in a bigger place - my backside .
" i think another number on the same foot as the old one might be more appropriate . "

abdelbaset ali al-megrahi has applied for interim liberation after being diagnosed with prostate cancer .
judges at the high court in edinburgh will announce whether the application has been successful .
his legal team has argued there is a " compelling case " for his release but prosecutors have said the gravity of the crime means he should stay in jail .
megrahi is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 27 years for the 1988 atrocity in which 270 people died .
he is currently in the process of making a second appeal against that conviction .
last week a bid was made to allow him to be released to reside with his family in scotland while receiving medical treatment .
i believe magrahi murdered my son and 269 other people and i believe he should rot in jail bob monetti the lord justice general , lord hamilton , will deliver the judgment with lord kingarth and lord wheatley .
megrahi will not be present in court .
it is understood that whatever the judges ' decision , there would be no appeal which could mean megrahi would be freed later on friday .
however , if that were to happen , he would be placed under strict conditions on his movements and where he lived .
jim swire , whose daughter flora was killed in the bombing , told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " my listening of the evidence at the trial convinced me that the guy was n't guilty as charged so i 'm not looking at someone i consider to be responsible for murdering my daughter . "
however , bob monetti , an american whose son rick was also killed , said megrahi should not be given bail .
" i believe magrahi murdered my son and 269 other people and i believe he should rot in jail , " he said .
" i have been really upset because most of the people in scotland seem to have a different opinion on the whole thing .
" my concern is that , god forbid , they should let him out on bail .
he will be out of the country in a couple of hours and no-one in the uk will really care much about it . "
