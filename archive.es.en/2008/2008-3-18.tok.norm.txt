" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

" i do n't see anything strange in this .
the church ca n't reject mechanical contraception on the one hand and on the other tolerate having condoms sold in a building belonging to the church , " the bishop 's spokesman , christof ohnesorg , said .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .

the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .

" but its replacement has brought no respite at all for its future . " a survey conducted by international media organizations said on monday that 55 percent of iraqis see the security situation in their neighborhood to have improved since last year .
nearly half of iraqis also said they expect the situation to improve .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .

merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .

germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries .

he is due to take control on thursday , after a nine-month-long standstill . " it 's a good deal for a government , with balanced measures , " flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme told belgium 's rtbf radio , according to the afp news service .
the agreement will likely see leterme sworn in as prime minister on thursday . the five parties involved in the compromise , and which currently form belgium 's interim government , must now agree on the composition of the future cabinet to ensure that the plan can put a final close to the country 's political turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves leterme is expected to head the new belgian government the agreement on a political program evolved after a night of negotiations between two dutch-speaking flemish parties and three francophone parties , which allowed a permanent coalition government to be arranged with a negotiated agenda . deal measures could take time francophone socialist party chief elio di rupo , current liberal finance minister didier reynders and the leader of the french-speaking centrists , joelle milquet , have all endorsed the new deal . di rupo said the agreement would provide a boost to the poorly paid , the retired and those receiving welfare .
the deal also includes measures to address climate change . reynders , however , said it would take years to turn some of the broad policies into concrete action , according to afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is split along linguistic lines belgium has been in political limbo since legislative elections in june 2007 , with the generally more affluent flemish north seeking greater regional powers , while leaders in the poorer french-speaking southern region of wallonia want political powers held by a central government .
other differences have existed in social , health and justice policies . the political instability has also prompted some to speculate that the country could be split in two along linguistic lines . leterme 's christian democrats came out ahead in last year 's general election .
the leader is due to be sworn in on thursday , after taking over from outgoing prime minister guy verhofstadt , who had agreed to stay on as interim leader until now . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .

merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .
on tuesday , government representatives from jordan , syria , iraq , lebanon and egypt are set to hold talks in amman to discuss the situation in the second meeting of its kind .

" better security in some parts of iraq must not distract attention from the continuing plight of millions of people who have essentially been left to their own devices , " said beatrice roggo , the icrc 's head of operations for the middle east and north africa . in a separate report marking the five-year anniversary of the us-led invasion this week , amnesty international said that iraq is currently " one of the most dangerous countries in the world . " not only is poverty widespread , but the human rights situation is " disastrous , " said the ngo . " saddam hussein 's administration was a byword for human rights abuse , " said , malcolm smart , amnesty 's director for the middle east and north africa .
" but its replacement has brought no respite at all for its future . " a survey conducted by international media organizations said on monday that 55 percent of iraqis see the security situation in their neighborhood to have improved since last year .
nearly half of iraqis also said they expect the situation to improve . " the change in mood clearly contrasts the extreme hopelessness , desperation and hate of the occupying forces that we found a year ago in a comparable study , " said arnd henze , who took part in administering the study for germany 's wdr public broadcaster . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .

" on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are dealing with one of the largest financial crises of the past few decades , " he added , pointing out that its effects could also be felt in germany . steinbrueck said germany had a better chance of withstanding the crisis than the american economy , calling it more " robust .

germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 18.03.2008 iraqis make up largest group of asylum-seekers to eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of iraqi asylum-seekers nearly doubled last year five years after the us-led invasion toppled saddam hussein 's dictatorship , the number of iraqis seeking asylum in 2007 nearly doubled over the previous year .
many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .

" it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .

dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is due to take control on thursday , after a nine-month-long standstill . " it 's a good deal for a government , with balanced measures , " flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme told belgium 's rtbf radio , according to the afp news service .
the agreement will likely see leterme sworn in as prime minister on thursday . the five parties involved in the compromise , and which currently form belgium 's interim government , must now agree on the composition of the future cabinet to ensure that the plan can put a final close to the country 's political turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves leterme is expected to head the new belgian government the agreement on a political program evolved after a night of negotiations between two dutch-speaking flemish parties and three francophone parties , which allowed a permanent coalition government to be arranged with a negotiated agenda . deal measures could take time francophone socialist party chief elio di rupo , current liberal finance minister didier reynders and the leader of the french-speaking centrists , joelle milquet , have all endorsed the new deal . di rupo said the agreement would provide a boost to the poorly paid , the retired and those receiving welfare .
the deal also includes measures to address climate change . reynders , however , said it would take years to turn some of the broad policies into concrete action , according to afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is split along linguistic lines belgium has been in political limbo since legislative elections in june 2007 , with the generally more affluent flemish north seeking greater regional powers , while leaders in the poorer french-speaking southern region of wallonia want political powers held by a central government .
other differences have existed in social , health and justice policies . the political instability has also prompted some to speculate that the country could be split in two along linguistic lines . leterme 's christian democrats came out ahead in last year 's general election .
the leader is due to be sworn in on thursday , after taking over from outgoing prime minister guy verhofstadt , who had agreed to stay on as interim leader until now . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .

observers from turkey , iran , the un and the group of eight industrialized nations are also expected to attend . un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres told journalists last month in amman that the international community underestimated the economic strain the refugee situation was placing on jordan and syria in particular . five years on , crisis continues , iraqis optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world , said ai the humanitarian situation in iraq is among the most critical in the world , said the international committee of the red cross said in a report released monday . " better security in some parts of iraq must not distract attention from the continuing plight of millions of people who have essentially been left to their own devices , " said beatrice roggo , the icrc 's head of operations for the middle east and north africa . in a separate report marking the five-year anniversary of the us-led invasion this week , amnesty international said that iraq is currently " one of the most dangerous countries in the world . " not only is poverty widespread , but the human rights situation is " disastrous , " said the ngo . " saddam hussein 's administration was a byword for human rights abuse , " said , malcolm smart , amnesty 's director for the middle east and north africa .
" but its replacement has brought no respite at all for its future . " a survey conducted by international media organizations said on monday that 55 percent of iraqis see the security situation in their neighborhood to have improved since last year .
nearly half of iraqis also said they expect the situation to improve .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .

the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .
on tuesday , government representatives from jordan , syria , iraq , lebanon and egypt are set to hold talks in amman to discuss the situation in the second meeting of its kind .
observers from turkey , iran , the un and the group of eight industrialized nations are also expected to attend . un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres told journalists last month in amman that the international community underestimated the economic strain the refugee situation was placing on jordan and syria in particular . five years on , crisis continues , iraqis optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world , said ai the humanitarian situation in iraq is among the most critical in the world , said the international committee of the red cross said in a report released monday .

" not only is poverty widespread , but the human rights situation is " disastrous , " said the ngo . " saddam hussein 's administration was a byword for human rights abuse , " said , malcolm smart , amnesty 's director for the middle east and north africa .
" but its replacement has brought no respite at all for its future . " a survey conducted by international media organizations said on monday that 55 percent of iraqis see the security situation in their neighborhood to have improved since last year .
nearly half of iraqis also said they expect the situation to improve . " the change in mood clearly contrasts the extreme hopelessness , desperation and hate of the occupying forces that we found a year ago in a comparable study , " said arnd henze , who took part in administering the study for germany 's wdr public broadcaster . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .

he is due to take control on thursday , after a nine-month-long standstill . " it 's a good deal for a government , with balanced measures , " flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme told belgium 's rtbf radio , according to the afp news service .
the agreement will likely see leterme sworn in as prime minister on thursday . the five parties involved in the compromise , and which currently form belgium 's interim government , must now agree on the composition of the future cabinet to ensure that the plan can put a final close to the country 's political turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves leterme is expected to head the new belgian government the agreement on a political program evolved after a night of negotiations between two dutch-speaking flemish parties and three francophone parties , which allowed a permanent coalition government to be arranged with a negotiated agenda . deal measures could take time francophone socialist party chief elio di rupo , current liberal finance minister didier reynders and the leader of the french-speaking centrists , joelle milquet , have all endorsed the new deal . di rupo said the agreement would provide a boost to the poorly paid , the retired and those receiving welfare .
the deal also includes measures to address climate change . reynders , however , said it would take years to turn some of the broad policies into concrete action , according to afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is split along linguistic lines belgium has been in political limbo since legislative elections in june 2007 , with the generally more affluent flemish north seeking greater regional powers , while leaders in the poorer french-speaking southern region of wallonia want political powers held by a central government .
other differences have existed in social , health and justice policies . the political instability has also prompted some to speculate that the country could be split in two along linguistic lines . leterme 's christian democrats came out ahead in last year 's general election .
the leader is due to be sworn in on thursday , after taking over from outgoing prime minister guy verhofstadt , who had agreed to stay on as interim leader until now . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .
he has disparaged former president vladimir putin , loudly criticized the political processes in the country , and called for russia 's ejection from g8 talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , mccain 's pow history gives him credibility mccain also said he would create a " league of democracies , " which would decide on issues independently of united nations and exclude russia , in his first term , if elected president . mccain was also harder on putin and his successor dmitry medvedev than was the current us president , george w. bush .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .

merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .
germany is home to three million muslims , the majority of them turkish . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq .

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .

graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent german manager said the state needs to get more involved . finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was managing the crisis ' effects on its economy well . " we in germany are relying greatly on optimal cooperation between politicians , the german central bank and the banking associations and institutions to keep further consequences to a minimum , " he said on tuesday , march 18 , in potsdam . " we are dealing with one of the largest financial crises of the past few decades , " he added , pointing out that its effects could also be felt in germany . steinbrueck said germany had a better chance of withstanding the crisis than the american economy , calling it more " robust . "
he also praised recent american attempts to help bail out us investment bank bear stearns from bankruptcy . " greater need for joint action " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck says german institutions have cooperated well so far " i am pleased about the measures taken this past weekend in the us to help contain the effects of this crisis , " steinbrueck said .

germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .
on tuesday , government representatives from jordan , syria , iraq , lebanon and egypt are set to hold talks in amman to discuss the situation in the second meeting of its kind .
observers from turkey , iran , the un and the group of eight industrialized nations are also expected to attend . un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres told journalists last month in amman that the international community underestimated the economic strain the refugee situation was placing on jordan and syria in particular . five years on , crisis continues , iraqis optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world , said ai the humanitarian situation in iraq is among the most critical in the world , said the international committee of the red cross said in a report released monday . " better security in some parts of iraq must not distract attention from the continuing plight of millions of people who have essentially been left to their own devices , " said beatrice roggo , the icrc 's head of operations for the middle east and north africa . in a separate report marking the five-year anniversary of the us-led invasion this week , amnesty international said that iraq is currently " one of the most dangerous countries in the world . " not only is poverty widespread , but the human rights situation is " disastrous , " said the ngo . " saddam hussein 's administration was a byword for human rights abuse , " said , malcolm smart , amnesty 's director for the middle east and north africa .
" but its replacement has brought no respite at all for its future . " a survey conducted by international media organizations said on monday that 55 percent of iraqis see the security situation in their neighborhood to have improved since last year .
nearly half of iraqis also said they expect the situation to improve . " the change in mood clearly contrasts the extreme hopelessness , desperation and hate of the occupying forces that we found a year ago in a comparable study , " said arnd henze , who took part in administering the study for germany 's wdr public broadcaster . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .

" we 're not allowed to sell condoms , because the building belongs to the catholic church , " monika michel , the manager of the branch said tuesday .
the clause was completely out of keeping with the times , michel said , but she acknowledged there was nothing she could do about it .
the catholic bishop in the city , situated in the state of hesse , was unapologetic when asked about the anomaly .
" i do n't see anything strange in this .
the church ca n't reject mechanical contraception on the one hand and on the other tolerate having condoms sold in a building belonging to the church , " the bishop 's spokesman , christof ohnesorg , said .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .
he has disparaged former president vladimir putin , loudly criticized the political processes in the country , and called for russia 's ejection from g8 talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , mccain 's pow history gives him credibility mccain also said he would create a " league of democracies , " which would decide on issues independently of united nations and exclude russia , in his first term , if elected president . mccain was also harder on putin and his successor dmitry medvedev than was the current us president , george w. bush .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .
on tuesday , government representatives from jordan , syria , iraq , lebanon and egypt are set to hold talks in amman to discuss the situation in the second meeting of its kind .
observers from turkey , iran , the un and the group of eight industrialized nations are also expected to attend . un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres told journalists last month in amman that the international community underestimated the economic strain the refugee situation was placing on jordan and syria in particular . five years on , crisis continues , iraqis optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world , said ai the humanitarian situation in iraq is among the most critical in the world , said the international committee of the red cross said in a report released monday .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

a prominent german manager said the state needs to get more involved . finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was managing the crisis ' effects on its economy well . " we in germany are relying greatly on optimal cooperation between politicians , the german central bank and the banking associations and institutions to keep further consequences to a minimum , " he said on tuesday , march 18 , in potsdam . " we are dealing with one of the largest financial crises of the past few decades , " he added , pointing out that its effects could also be felt in germany . steinbrueck said germany had a better chance of withstanding the crisis than the american economy , calling it more " robust . "
he also praised recent american attempts to help bail out us investment bank bear stearns from bankruptcy . " greater need for joint action " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck says german institutions have cooperated well so far " i am pleased about the measures taken this past weekend in the us to help contain the effects of this crisis , " steinbrueck said .
competitor bank jpmorgan chase was able to take over bear stearns at a rock-bottom price through a $ 30 billion -lrb- 19 billion euro -rrb- guarantee by the us federal reserve bank . bankruptcy at bear stearns could have sparked similar troubles at other financial institutions . deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann on monday called on governments around the world to play a more active role in the markets to ease the liquidity crisis in the banking sector . he said joint action between central banks , governments and the banks themselves was necessary to restore confidence in financial markets , but also said the current international turbulence made it unlikely that the markets would recover without outside assistance . cuts to german economic growth expected on monday , european stock markets had suffered sharp losses , responding to the emergency bailout of bear stearns and increasing fears on the fragile global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said the state needs to play a key role in solving the financial crisis the european central bank on tuesday allocated an extra 25 billion euros in liquidity during its regular weekly refinancing operation , an attempt to curb fresh anxiety on money markets . the ecb 's action follows moves by the bank of japan , the reserve bank of australia , and the bank of england to pump additional funds into money markets monday .
during a meeting on tuesday , the us central bank is also expected to cut interest rates by one percent . german economists said they expected market turmoil to have negative effects on the country 's economy . " little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " said gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute . he predicted that growth would reach just 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries . " it is the influence of the weak dollar , rising oil prices , falling us economy and financial crisis that is making the situation difficult for companies , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on tuesday . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .
germany is home to three million muslims , the majority of them turkish . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent german manager said the state needs to get more involved . finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was managing the crisis ' effects on its economy well . " we in germany are relying greatly on optimal cooperation between politicians , the german central bank and the banking associations and institutions to keep further consequences to a minimum , " he said on tuesday , march 18 , in potsdam . " we are dealing with one of the largest financial crises of the past few decades , " he added , pointing out that its effects could also be felt in germany . steinbrueck said germany had a better chance of withstanding the crisis than the american economy , calling it more " robust . "
he also praised recent american attempts to help bail out us investment bank bear stearns from bankruptcy . " greater need for joint action " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck says german institutions have cooperated well so far " i am pleased about the measures taken this past weekend in the us to help contain the effects of this crisis , " steinbrueck said .
competitor bank jpmorgan chase was able to take over bear stearns at a rock-bottom price through a $ 30 billion -lrb- 19 billion euro -rrb- guarantee by the us federal reserve bank . bankruptcy at bear stearns could have sparked similar troubles at other financial institutions . deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann on monday called on governments around the world to play a more active role in the markets to ease the liquidity crisis in the banking sector . he said joint action between central banks , governments and the banks themselves was necessary to restore confidence in financial markets , but also said the current international turbulence made it unlikely that the markets would recover without outside assistance . cuts to german economic growth expected on monday , european stock markets had suffered sharp losses , responding to the emergency bailout of bear stearns and increasing fears on the fragile global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said the state needs to play a key role in solving the financial crisis the european central bank on tuesday allocated an extra 25 billion euros in liquidity during its regular weekly refinancing operation , an attempt to curb fresh anxiety on money markets . the ecb 's action follows moves by the bank of japan , the reserve bank of australia , and the bank of england to pump additional funds into money markets monday .
during a meeting on tuesday , the us central bank is also expected to cut interest rates by one percent . german economists said they expected market turmoil to have negative effects on the country 's economy . " little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " said gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute . he predicted that growth would reach just 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries . " it is the influence of the weak dollar , rising oil prices , falling us economy and financial crisis that is making the situation difficult for companies , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on tuesday . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is due to take control on thursday , after a nine-month-long standstill . " it 's a good deal for a government , with balanced measures , " flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme told belgium 's rtbf radio , according to the afp news service .
the agreement will likely see leterme sworn in as prime minister on thursday . the five parties involved in the compromise , and which currently form belgium 's interim government , must now agree on the composition of the future cabinet to ensure that the plan can put a final close to the country 's political turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves leterme is expected to head the new belgian government the agreement on a political program evolved after a night of negotiations between two dutch-speaking flemish parties and three francophone parties , which allowed a permanent coalition government to be arranged with a negotiated agenda . deal measures could take time francophone socialist party chief elio di rupo , current liberal finance minister didier reynders and the leader of the french-speaking centrists , joelle milquet , have all endorsed the new deal . di rupo said the agreement would provide a boost to the poorly paid , the retired and those receiving welfare .
the deal also includes measures to address climate change . reynders , however , said it would take years to turn some of the broad policies into concrete action , according to afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is split along linguistic lines belgium has been in political limbo since legislative elections in june 2007 , with the generally more affluent flemish north seeking greater regional powers , while leaders in the poorer french-speaking southern region of wallonia want political powers held by a central government .
other differences have existed in social , health and justice policies . the political instability has also prompted some to speculate that the country could be split in two along linguistic lines . leterme 's christian democrats came out ahead in last year 's general election .
the leader is due to be sworn in on thursday , after taking over from outgoing prime minister guy verhofstadt , who had agreed to stay on as interim leader until now . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent german manager said the state needs to get more involved . finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was managing the crisis ' effects on its economy well . " we in germany are relying greatly on optimal cooperation between politicians , the german central bank and the banking associations and institutions to keep further consequences to a minimum , " he said on tuesday , march 18 , in potsdam . " we are dealing with one of the largest financial crises of the past few decades , " he added , pointing out that its effects could also be felt in germany . steinbrueck said germany had a better chance of withstanding the crisis than the american economy , calling it more " robust . "
he also praised recent american attempts to help bail out us investment bank bear stearns from bankruptcy . " greater need for joint action " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck says german institutions have cooperated well so far " i am pleased about the measures taken this past weekend in the us to help contain the effects of this crisis , " steinbrueck said .
competitor bank jpmorgan chase was able to take over bear stearns at a rock-bottom price through a $ 30 billion -lrb- 19 billion euro -rrb- guarantee by the us federal reserve bank . bankruptcy at bear stearns could have sparked similar troubles at other financial institutions . deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann on monday called on governments around the world to play a more active role in the markets to ease the liquidity crisis in the banking sector . he said joint action between central banks , governments and the banks themselves was necessary to restore confidence in financial markets , but also said the current international turbulence made it unlikely that the markets would recover without outside assistance . cuts to german economic growth expected on monday , european stock markets had suffered sharp losses , responding to the emergency bailout of bear stearns and increasing fears on the fragile global financial system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said the state needs to play a key role in solving the financial crisis the european central bank on tuesday allocated an extra 25 billion euros in liquidity during its regular weekly refinancing operation , an attempt to curb fresh anxiety on money markets . the ecb 's action follows moves by the bank of japan , the reserve bank of australia , and the bank of england to pump additional funds into money markets monday .
during a meeting on tuesday , the us central bank is also expected to cut interest rates by one percent . german economists said they expected market turmoil to have negative effects on the country 's economy . " little by little , the turbulence in the financial markets and the strong euro are taking their toll , " said gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute . he predicted that growth would reach just 1.3 percent , down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent .
germany 's economy booked 2.5 percent growth last year . threats to germany 's economy can not be attributed to a single cause , according to juergen thumann , head of the federation of german industries . " it is the influence of the weak dollar , rising oil prices , falling us economy and financial crisis that is making the situation difficult for companies , " he told the daily berliner zeitung on tuesday . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.03.2008 merkel addresses israeli parliament amid controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an emotional speech , merkel said germany will be committed to israel 's security chancellor merkel addressed the israeli parliament on tuesday amid controversy - some mps boycotted the speech while hamas slammed merkel for being blind to what it called israel 's " holocaust " against palestinians . german chancellor angela merkel 's three-day solidarity visit to israel to mark the 60th anniversary of the creation of the jewish state following the nazi holocaust climaxed with a historic speech to the knesset , the israeli parliament on tuesday , march 17 .
the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .
he has disparaged former president vladimir putin , loudly criticized the political processes in the country , and called for russia 's ejection from g8 talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , mccain 's pow history gives him credibility mccain also said he would create a " league of democracies , " which would decide on issues independently of united nations and exclude russia , in his first term , if elected president . mccain was also harder on putin and his successor dmitry medvedev than was the current us president , george w. bush . " bush looked into putin 's eyes and ' got a sense of his soul " ' , braml noted wryly .

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added .

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .

“ what we ’ ve chosen is market leaders of mobile phones , pcs , tvs , and game consoles .

motorola , another electronics giant , improved its ranking from the 14 th to the 12th position for running a successful take back and recycling operation in the philippines , thailand and india .
nokia made it to the third spot , missing the top position for failing to improve recycling services in india and russia . and nintendo lurked at the bottom of the rankings with a paltry score of 0.3 for its poor environmental record .

many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .
on tuesday , government representatives from jordan , syria , iraq , lebanon and egypt are set to hold talks in amman to discuss the situation in the second meeting of its kind .
observers from turkey , iran , the un and the group of eight industrialized nations are also expected to attend . un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres told journalists last month in amman that the international community underestimated the economic strain the refugee situation was placing on jordan and syria in particular . five years on , crisis continues , iraqis optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world , said ai the humanitarian situation in iraq is among the most critical in the world , said the international committee of the red cross said in a report released monday . " better security in some parts of iraq must not distract attention from the continuing plight of millions of people who have essentially been left to their own devices , " said beatrice roggo , the icrc 's head of operations for the middle east and north africa . in a separate report marking the five-year anniversary of the us-led invasion this week , amnesty international said that iraq is currently " one of the most dangerous countries in the world .

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .
he has disparaged former president vladimir putin , loudly criticized the political processes in the country , and called for russia 's ejection from g8 talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , mccain 's pow history gives him credibility mccain also said he would create a " league of democracies , " which would decide on issues independently of united nations and exclude russia , in his first term , if elected president . mccain was also harder on putin and his successor dmitry medvedev than was the current us president , george w. bush . " bush looked into putin 's eyes and ' got a sense of his soul " ' , braml noted wryly .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .
he has disparaged former president vladimir putin , loudly criticized the political processes in the country , and called for russia 's ejection from g8 talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many , mccain 's pow history gives him credibility mccain also said he would create a " league of democracies , " which would decide on issues independently of united nations and exclude russia , in his first term , if elected president . mccain was also harder on putin and his successor dmitry medvedev than was the current us president , george w. bush .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "

israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

the 53-year-old became the first german head of government to address the knesset , an honor normally reserved for heads of state .
merkel told israel 's parliament that germans are filled with shame over the nazi holocaust and that she bows before the victims .
in an emotional speech , delivered in german and a smattering of hebrew , merkel said her country will always be committed to israel 's security , particularly in light of growing threats from iran .
" to speak to you in this honourable assembly is a great honour for me , " merkel said in hebrew . " i thank you all that i am allowed to speak to you in my mother tongue today , " merkel continued in german .
" the shoah fills us germans with shame , " she said , using the hebrew word for the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed .
" i bow to the victims .
i bow to all those who helped the survivors . "
mixed feelings about german in the knesset but merkel 's speech in german has ruffled some feathers in israel , where memories of the nazis ' murder of six million jews during world war ii run deep .
five legislators in the 120-member knesset stayed away in protest , saying they did not want to hear german spoken .
others , including at least one holocaust survivor , criticized the plans as " populist . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shimon peres welcomes merkel with a kiss " i know the last sounds heard by my grandparents and my uncles whom i have not known were those of the german language , " said arieh eldad , an mp of the far-right national union-national religious party .
israel radio reported shelly yachimovich , of the coalition labor party , as saying she would stay absent from the speech because it was " insensitive " toward holocaust survivors to hold it in german , " the language of their torturers - ss officers , camp commanders and the gestapo . "
" it 's very hard to hear the german language in the knesset .
we want to remind -lrb- people -rrb- that despite the fact that germany today is indeed showing friendship toward israel , we remember what had happened , " said yitzhak levy , of the same party .
but a 73-year-old lawmaker , who is a holocaust survivor herself , criticized the boycott as " nothing but populism . "
" it does n't bother me at all that merkel chose to speak in german , " said romanian-born sara marom shalev , of the coalition pensioners ' party .
labour party lawmaker ophir pines , also the son of a holocaust survivor , criticized the boycott as well as an " inappropriate provocation . "
cementing relations the issue of german being spoken inside the israeli parliament has sparked angry protests before in the jewish state .
when johannes rau became the first german head of state to address the knesset in 2000 , he did so in german and several israeli mps stormed out in protest .
his successor horst koehler received a warmer reception five years later and included several sentences in hebrew in his speech .
israel and germany established ties in 1965 after years of negotiations , including over reparations for jewish property seized during the holocaust .
israel has since come to regard germany as its strongest ally in europe .
and on monday , the two countries further tightened their friendly but loaded relations by signing a bilateral agreement for tighter military , cultural , political and economic cooperation .
the agreement was signed at a symbolic , first ever joint cabinet session in jerusalem , attended by 17 ministers of both sides , including merkel and prime minister ehud olmert .
hamas slams merkel visit merkel 's last day of her visit was also marred by strong comments by radical islamist movement hamas which slammed merkel for closing her eyes to what it labeled as israel 's " holocaust " against the palestinians in the gaza strip .
merkel 's comments " reflect a moral degradation into which this chancellor has fallen by supporting without failure an entity that commits massacres against palestinian children , women and the elderly , " hamas said .
the islamists also said the chancellor " has closed her eyes to the holocaust that this entity has perpetrated in the gaza strip , focusing only on the holocaust committed by the nazis against jews in her country , the extent of which is a subject of doubts and exaggerations . "
hamas has pledged itself to israel 's destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian boy jumps over a pile of rubble after an israeli strike the comments referred to israeli operations in the territory that began on february 27 in response to rocket fire and that killed more than 130 palestinians , including several dozen children and other civilians , in the course of a little more than a week .
five israelis were also killed .
merkel , who was urged to be critical during her visit to israel and raise questions about israel 's continued building of jewish settlements in the west bank , sidestepped the settlement issue during talks with prime minister ehud olmert on monday , saying only the question was complex .
when asked about almost daily rocket fire launched at southern israel by palestinian militants in gaza , she said , " there are conditions that do n't make talks any easier .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .

" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .

but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 18.03.2008 seniors remain influential despite gray panthers ' extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new party aimed at fromer greys members is being planned germany 's " gray panthers " had all but closed down their party doors , after nearly two decades of representing seniors ' concerns .
the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 18.03.2008 iraqis make up largest group of asylum-seekers to eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of iraqi asylum-seekers nearly doubled last year five years after the us-led invasion toppled saddam hussein 's dictatorship , the number of iraqis seeking asylum in 2007 nearly doubled over the previous year .
many of them seek refuge in the european union . a five-year downward trend in the overall number of people seeking asylum in industrialized countries was reversed last year , according to a report released tuesday , march 18 , by the united nations high commissioner for refugees . nearly half of asylum-seekers from around the world found new homes in the european union last year , with the majority of them coming from iraq . " the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .

" the overall downward trend in asylum applications was offset last year by a large increase in the number of asylum seekers from iraq , " the unhcr said in a statement . in 2007 , 338,000 total asylum applications were filed in 43 industrialized countries - 10 percent more than in 2006 , when a 20-year low was registered .
the rise was largely attributed to the ongoing crisis in iraq . 4.5 million iraqis displaced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djabar lafte latif is one of the iraqi refugees living in germany iraqis topped the list of applicants for the second year in a row , accounting for over 10 percent of the total with 45,200 applications in 2007 .
among the top five countries of origin were russia -lrb- 18,800 applications -rrb- , china -lrb- 17,100 -rrb- , serbia -lrb- 15,400 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 14,300 -rrb- .
half of all asylum applications came from asia . " it is important to bear in mind that iraqi asylum-seekers in industrialized countries represent only 1 percent of the estimated 4.5 million iraqis uprooted by the conflict , " the unhcr report said . an estimated 2 million iraqis have fled to neighboring jordan and syria , while another 2.5 million have been internally displaced . eight of top 10 receiving countries in eu the united states , which took in nearly 15 percent of all asylum-seekers in 2007 , remains the most common country of application .
however , it has only one asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants , while the density in the european union is higher , with 2.6 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants . sweden is the second most popular destination .
the scandinavian country registered a total of 36,200 claims last year - a 50 percent increase over 2006 . eight of the top 10 receiving countries are in europe .
france , canada and the uk followed sweden , taking in 8.6 , 8.4 and 8.2 percent of applicants respectively .
germany received applications from 5.7 percent of asylum seekers in 2007 . greece , italy , austria and belgium were also among the top 10 receiving countries . iraq 's neighbors in the middle east , however , still bear the brunt of its refugee burden .
on tuesday , government representatives from jordan , syria , iraq , lebanon and egypt are set to hold talks in amman to discuss the situation in the second meeting of its kind .
observers from turkey , iran , the un and the group of eight industrialized nations are also expected to attend . un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres told journalists last month in amman that the international community underestimated the economic strain the refugee situation was placing on jordan and syria in particular . five years on , crisis continues , iraqis optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world , said ai the humanitarian situation in iraq is among the most critical in the world , said the international committee of the red cross said in a report released monday . " better security in some parts of iraq must not distract attention from the continuing plight of millions of people who have essentially been left to their own devices , " said beatrice roggo , the icrc 's head of operations for the middle east and north africa . in a separate report marking the five-year anniversary of the us-led invasion this week , amnesty international said that iraq is currently " one of the most dangerous countries in the world . " not only is poverty widespread , but the human rights situation is " disastrous , " said the ngo . " saddam hussein 's administration was a byword for human rights abuse , " said , malcolm smart , amnesty 's director for the middle east and north africa .
" but its replacement has brought no respite at all for its future . " a survey conducted by international media organizations said on monday that 55 percent of iraqis see the security situation in their neighborhood to have improved since last year .
nearly half of iraqis also said they expect the situation to improve . " the change in mood clearly contrasts the extreme hopelessness , desperation and hate of the occupying forces that we found a year ago in a comparable study , " said arnd henze , who took part in administering the study for germany 's wdr public broadcaster . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .

russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 18.03.2008 seniors remain influential despite gray panthers ' extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new party aimed at fromer greys members is being planned germany 's " gray panthers " had all but closed down their party doors , after nearly two decades of representing seniors ' concerns .
the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .
former grays ' party deputy head manfred albrecht told the associated press there were preliminary plans to start a new seniors ' party . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 18.03.2008 german court upholds school ban on muslim headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf issue is a hot topic in germany , a country with many muslims a german court has rejected a bid by a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf during lessons who argued she be treated the same as nuns at a state school who are permitted to teach in their religious habits . upholding a regional ban on teachers wearing the islamic headscarf in public schools , the administrative court in the southern german state of baden-württemberg ruled that a teacher who converted to islam will not be allowed to wear her headscarf in the classroom , the court in mannheim rejected a bid by 58-year-old doris graber who converted to islam to wear her headscarf during lessons , saying the teacher was violating her obligation to keep religious expression out of the classroom and that the ban fully complied with the country 's basic law .
" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

its inventor , who died a mysterious premature death in the british canal , would have turned 150 on march 18 . diesel has become a synonym for efficiency and environmental friendliness when it comes to making things go .
over a century after its initial invention , the diesel engine is still being developed , to be used in airplanes and run on biofuels , for example . the man traditionally accredited with its invention , rudolf diesel , was born on march 18 , 1858 , in paris to a german bookbinder and his wife .
when the franco-prussian war broke out in 1870 , the family fled to london .
suffering from the economic ramifications of the war , they could n't afford to support young rudolf and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in augsburg . it was there in southern germany , where he attended the royal county trade school and later went on to graduate from the polytechnic university in munich with highest academic honors , that he developed his passion for engineering and made early plans for a new motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diesel creates higher emissions than gas , but you need less of it to go the same distance in 1893 , he published a book concretely outlining his engine design and was commissioned by the engine factory augsburg nuremberg - the forerunner of today 's man group - to build a prototype . more power for less fuel completed in 1897 , the prototype produced 14 kilowatts of power , much more than other motors of the time .
it also ran on significantly less fuel . diesel 's engine , which is on display today in the german museum in munich , functioned by heating compressed air with pistons until it was hot enough to ignited the injected fuel .
while typical diesel fuel is an oil by-product derived from the petroleum refinement process , diesel had made plans to eventually run his engine on vegetable oils . though he was n't able to see the development through , diesel 's plan for an oil-less motor earned him enemies in the oil sector . the animosities , in part , fuelled the mystery surrounding his death . corpse found in english channel on sept .
29 , 1913 , diesel was traveling by boat across the english channel to attend a conference in london .
he retired to his cabin in the evening and was never seen alive again .
the engineer 's body was discovered in the water some days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetable oil - diesel had futuristic ideas about fuel though the official version was that diesel committed suicide by jumping overboard , rumors circulated that he had been murdered - possibly commissioned either by oil bigwigs or by the german empire . at the time of diesel 's death in 1913 , premonitions of world war i were rumbling through europe and the german empire likely wasn ’ t happy that diesel was looking to sell his motor patent to france and england .
emperor wilhelm ii had allegedly wanted exclusive rights to diesel warship motors . while the exact cause of diesel 's death will remain a mystery , his name is liable to be common jargon for a while to come - increasingly in connection with the biofuels the inventor himself had aimed for . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly half of iraqis also said they expect the situation to improve .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added .

" campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .

his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .

" on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it .

after visiting iraq this week , us senator john mccain will go to paris and london , but not berlin .
the omission can be read in different ways , but the key may be not to read too much into it at all , some experts say . germany is well-charted territory for the presumptive republican presidential candidate mccain .
as a member of the senate armed services committee , he is a longtime attendee at the munich conference on security policy , an annual powwow of international policymakers . so the fact that the high-profile politician is giving germany a miss when he swings through the middle east and europe this week could be seen as a snub or could simply reflect that he is so well known to berlin that he does n't have anything to prove , one expert said . the trip is being called a fact-finding mission for the armed services committee , but " this visit has more to do with domestic politics in the us than anything else , " said josef braml , a us-expert at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , an independent foreign-policy think tank . " it is more for mccain to demonstrate his foreign policy credentials - that he can talk to europeans , " he said .
" that is the message they want to drive home to the domestic audience . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain is frequently at the munich security conference mccain 's visit to iraq and the middle east is even more important than his visit to europe , braml added . " he is visiting iraq and his electoral fortunes are heavily linked to the situation there .
europe is just the side story , " he said . a lot is at stake for mccain 's in terms of iraq - his political standing " is linked to that war , " braml added .
" one can see that as the surge materializes , the situation has gotten somewhat better , and the americans are a little less pessimistic . " campaign stop in disguise ? meanwhile , his decision to stop in france and england could indicate that he wants to take the opportunity to improve ties with those countries , relative to his already well-developed , links to berlin . in the end the decision to avoid berlin either means that relations are so good he does n't need to spend time in the chancellery , or that germany is totally out of the loop . " there are both readings , and that is important , braml said .
" but which one would be true - that is just speculation . " observers in the us have begun complaining that the trip , repeatedly billed in the media as a routine fact-finding tour , is being turned into an overt campaign stop .
indeed , the senator from arizona plans to hold a fundraiser luncheon at london 's spencer house on thursday , the los angeles times newspaper reported . be careful what you wish for but whether the campaigning is overt or covert , europeans are watching closely , with many fervently hoping for a new wind in washington .
however , braml warned that " people should be careful what they wish for - they just might get it . " until now , mccain has sent mixed signals about what kind of foreign policy his administration would run .
his wide-ranging statements have vacillated between old-fashioned republican realism , and a neoconservative idealism .
one of his advisers , mark salter , told bloomberg news service mccain is a " realistic idealist . " mccain may sound hawkish when he talks about committing to staying in iraq for 100 years .
but it could be better than the alternative , braml argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the democratic contenders said they would also go-it-alone if needed " i 'm not so sure europeans would be so happy if the us left iraq and simply left the mess behind , " he said .
" whether they admit it or not , europeans hope the us will not fail in its obligation to stabilize the region .
it 's in all our interests . " close to germany on many issues on other issues , such as his commitment to fighting climate change , his promise to close down the detention centers at guantanamo bay and his strict anti-torture stance , europeans are on the same page as mccain , according to braml . moreover , mccain 's democratic competition is no better when it comes to the question of american hegemony . " on the question of unilateral action there is n't much difference between all the candidates , " braml said of the candidates ' foreign policy agendas .
" even -lsb- democratic candidate barak -rsb- obama says he would do it . " but ivo daalder , an obama adviser , told bloomberg news service he thought mccain was emphasizing his moderate stance on detainee policy and climate change in order to cloak his " hawkish position on nonproliferation , china and russia . " " this is a man who has n't seen a country he does n't want to invade , " dalder told bloomberg . russia likely to be a sticking point mccain has , indeed , been tough on moscow .

" we had a positive spirit yesterday .
we look forward to further work today , to having greater details so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences , " rice said . russian defense minister sergei lavrov said russia was " satisfied with the way our relations are developing " and that there was a will to inimise discord . " gates predicted the two sides could conclude a deal on disputed us missile defence plans before bush leaves office in january 2009 . earlier on monday , putin said there was a real chance to make progress on stalled talks with the us over washington 's controversial plans to install a missile defense system on european soil . putin said he saw an opportunity to move relations with the us forward after he received what he called a " serious document " from us president george bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev , left , has said he will continue with putin 's policies " i recently had an opportunity to speak to the us president and i received his letter , " putin said . " it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
if we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . "
dimitry medvedev , who won a landslide election earlier this month and is to succeed putin as president , sounded a conciliatory note after his first talks with gates and rice .
" there are issue where we still have differences in positions , " medvedev said .
" but we also have a common will and commitment to move ahead . "
russia critical of missile defense washington announced in jan 2007 that it wanted to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to cover us territory but also some european allies , and wanted it operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own nuclear deterrent and has warned it could target the polish and czech sites .
europe uneasy about us plans the dispute has pushed diplomatic relations between the us and russia to a post-cold war low and has sparked deep unease among european governments split between supporting us plans and the need to take seriously russia 's concerns about the missile defense system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have divided merkel 's coalition in germany , the row has exposed divisions in chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition .
the center-left social democrats remain opposed to the missile defense system , warning it could spark a new arms race while merkel 's conservative christian democrats are largely in favor .
merkel has called for a debate on the plans within nato and called for a united eu approach to the shield .
the plans have also raised concerns in poland and the czech republic where some worry their countries would become targets for terrorists .
there are also concerns the shield project could be dropped in the event of a democratic victory in november 's us presidential election .
russian political analyst fyodor lukyanov told news agency afp he doubted gates ' statement that agreement on missile defense could be achieved under the bush administration and said both sides were in a holding position dictated by domestic politics .
bush is unlikely to change his position on missile defence in his final year , and moscow will wait for a possible democratic victory in us presidential elections in november in the hope of a change of position , lukyanov said . " the russian side can expect the new administration to at least re-evaluate " the project .
" not that the americans will cancel this project but at least change some of the approaches , " said lukyanov , who edits the journal russia in global affairs . the topic of the us missile shield in europe has also generated discussion among defense experts who say that its deployment would be a major shift towards a defensive strategy of deterrence in a new era of nuclear proliferation and rogue regimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 18.03.2008 seniors remain influential despite gray panthers ' extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new party aimed at fromer greys members is being planned germany 's " gray panthers " had all but closed down their party doors , after nearly two decades of representing seniors ' concerns .
the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .

" the directive issued by the school administration for those working at the school not to wear such a head covering is lawful , " the court said in a statement , summarizing the ruling made friday .
" this also applies when the teacher in question is an employee with tenure who has worked at a school for several years with such a head covering without complaints from pupils or students . "
no to headscarves , yes to habits ?
the judges overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed graber to wear a headscarf because nuns who taught at state schools were permitted to do so in their religious habits .
the administrative court however rejected graber 's argument that she should be treated the same as three nuns in a public school elsewhere in the state on the grounds of religious equality .
the judges however did not give a reason for rejecting the argument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graber argues she should be treated the same as nuns earlier last week , the state attorney spoke of a " historic exception " in the aforementioned public school where the nuns still teach in habit .
the public school , which was formerly a monastery , was taken over by the state and authorities are bound to a contract governing the " exceptions status " of the school , he said .
graber , who has taught at a joint elementary and secondary school for more than three decades , converted to islam in 1984 .
she had worn a traditional muslim headscarf in the classroom since 1995 during which time no objections were raised .
but in december 2004 , the school board in the state capital stuttgart ordered her to stop covering her head in the classroom on the grounds that it could influence impressionable children , prompting her to go to court .
" i 've been wearing a headscarf for 13 years and nobody has taken offence until now , " graber said at a court hearing .
differing laws on headscarf baden-württemberg was the first of germany 's 16 states to ban the headscarf in schools after it was outlawed in france in 2004 .
the french ban sparked a heated debate in germany and the federal constitutional court , the country 's top court , finally ruled that each region had the right to make its own law in this regard .
so far eight out of germany 's 16 states have ordered teachers not to wear the headscarf at schools , though muslim pupils are generally allowed to do so .

the 60-plus crowd , however , is n't vanishing from the political landscape . despite the demise of the grays - the party which evolved out of the gray panthers and is likely to dissolve due to a funding scandal - german senior citizens are , in fact , likely to remain an ever-increasing force in the country politics . " demographic and health developments all point to a situation where seniors will make up a larger and larger portion of the electorate , " said oskar niedermayer of berlin 's free university . those aged 65 and over made up nearly 20 percent of the population - a percentage that has been steadily growing , according to the german statistics office 's figures for 2006 . voter participation also continually increases as people pass the age of 25 then falls slightly when they reach about 65 , niedermayer said . the power of the gray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older voters can be counted on to continue going to the polls germany 's 60-plus generation , the last to have lived though world war ii , also is n't likely to stop going to the polls , according to ursula lenz , the spokeswoman for the german seniors lobby group bagso . " many seniors say they may not agree with this , that or the other about a party , but go and vote because they lived through a time when that was n't possible , " she said . but while doing their civic duty , seniors are n't aware of the political power they wield , niedermayer said . " if it were to come to a conflict between the young and old , the older people would be able to put the parties that they think better address their concerns in power , " he said . served by major political parties despite the occasional headlines proclaiming " seniors ripping off the young " as the mass-market tabloid bild ran on its front page last week , niedermayer said he did n't expect a generational debate to divide germans into age-specific camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors ' political views differ on many issues " this is n't a danger as long as the major political parties continue addressing seniors ' needs , " he said . for now the major parties seem to be doing that .
in the last federal election 77 percent of voters over 60 chose either the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- or the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - more than any other age bracket . seniors are also heavily represented in german parties .
people over 60 make up 50 percent more of spd and cdu / csu party members than they do among the general population . political parties , all of which have organizations dedicated to seniors ' issues , will increasingly depend on finding ways to appeal to senior citizens , but it is likely to be a difficult task . seniors ' varied interests " the differences between the main parties , especially in the grand coalition , are n't so large , " lenz said , adding that a general political consensus on seniors ' topics existed among all germany 's political parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , now 83 , founded the grey panthers in 1989 other than material interests in seeing pension payments increased and healthcare costs kept down , the diversity of seniors ' political concerns is one of the reasons why the gray party never received a substantial number of votes , niedermayer added . " older citizens do not vote only according to what matters to them as seniors , " he said .
" their interests are as varied as in other sections of the electorate . " the grays ' meager 0.4 percent of votes in the 2005 federal election was n't enough to finish the party , but parliamentary demands to pay back 8.5 million euros -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- worth of funding due to suspected donation fraud led the party to disband this month . the 3,300 party members , however , may find a new home .

mr pueyo heads fleury-merogis prison , near paris , which holds 3,800 people .
however , british prisons minister david hanson said fleury-merogis was a success because it had facilities that smaller jails could not offer .
governor advice senior prison officer bernard gaudicheau told the file on 4 programme he judged the 40-year-old prison to be a failure .
mr pueyo said if large prisons were given the go-ahead in the uk , prisoners should be held in separately-managed buildings holding 400 each with one to a cell .
in europe 's largest prison mr hanson said that the titan prisons would consist of separate blocks .
he added that small jails could not provide the programmes on offer at a prison such as fleury-merogis .

traffic grinds along the ring-road , which is riddled with potholes .
nearby , a new european union funded motorway is under construction which is supposed to ease the bottlenecks .
but after two officials at bulgaria 's traffic agency were caught taking bribes , the european union has frozen some of its infrastructure subsidies , including roughly 100 million euros -lrb- £ 79m -rrb- for the motorway .
unless the bulgarian government is prepared to replace that money , sofia 's commuters will continue to suffer .
malpractice tackling corruption and organised crime was supposed to be a pre-condition for bulgaria 's membership of the eu . "
the number of people being convicted has n't changed - it 's very low and those that are convicted are junior officials " yovo nikolov , kapital magazine but just over a year after it joined , three streams of eu funding have been suspended because of apparent fraud , and the eu 's investigating agency has 45 cases of alleged bulgarian malpractice on its books .
" nothing 's changed , " says yovo nikolov , an award-winning investigative reporter for the weekly magazine kapital .
" if there was a real fight against corruption , you would see more corruption convictions from the courts .
" but the number of people being convicted has n't changed - it 's very low and those that are convicted are junior officials .
that shows the authorities are n't tackling it effectively . "
critics have suggested the recent spate of apparent misuse of european funds shows that bulgaria is backsliding on reform , now that it has jumped the hurdles to win membership of the eu .
but the european commission warns it is keeping bulgaria on a short leash .
powerful threat " the european commission is obliged to safeguard the financial interests of all european taxpayers , " says the european commission 's head of representation in sofia , zinaida zlatanova .
" the commission decided to suspend the funds so that the bulgarian authorities will take serious , concrete measures to deal with the issues .
and the commission will do this every time there is even a suspicion of mismanagement . "
that threat is a powerful one .
the european commission 's budget for bulgaria for 2007-2013 comes to around 9bn euros .
" the signal that was sent was a very strong one , " says assen arghov , a member of parliament for the opposition democrats for a strong bulgaria .
" people in the european commission may be bureaucrats but they 're very stingy bureaucrats .
the bulgarian authorities are in a panic . "
he claims the eu has now suspended so much funding that bulgaria is paying in more to eu coffers than it gets back - a strange situation for one of the eu 's poorest members .
patience needed but maria anguilieva , an mp from the ruling coalition and the deputy chair of the parliamentary eu affairs committee says europe needs to be a little more patient .
" i think it 's normal one year after accession not to be the best .
we are trying to be the best and we 've achieved a lot in a very short time , " she says .
but in one of sofia 's markets , optimism is wearing thin .
" corruption is not just an everyday thing , it 's an every minute thing , " said one lady , selling shiny red tomatoes to shoppers , stopping off on their way home from work .
" everyone wants money for everything , " agreed a lady on a nearby stall .
" anything you want to do , you need to have connections and you need to give bribes . "
benchmarks the european union imposed a special corruption monitoring scheme on bulgaria , and its neighbour romania , when they joined the eu in january 2007 because it was felt they were not yet up to eu levels .
if bulgaria does not meet specified benchmarks , the eu can impose what it calls safeguard clauses .
under one provision , a quarter of the subsidies which bulgaria 's farmers receive can be held back .
that worries elizabeta bozilova , who is operations manager on one of bulgaria 's largest dairy farms , just outside the second city , plovdiv .
her farm has already received 700,000 euros to help bring the farm up to eu standards .
but she fears corruption could jeopardise future funding .
" it 's difficult to keep the high standards that are demanded , so the money from the eu is really important , " she says .
" i 'm angry because the corruption takes place with officials at a higher level , but we are the ones that need the money . "
pressure is growing on the bulgarian government from farmers , the public , but above all from the eu .
with european public opinion increasingly sceptical about the merits of bringing poor countries like bulgaria into an enlarged european union , brussels needs to prove taxpayers ' money is not going down the drain .

traffic grinds along the ring-road , which is riddled with potholes .
nearby , a new european union funded motorway is under construction which is supposed to ease the bottlenecks .
but after two officials at bulgaria 's traffic agency were caught taking bribes , the european union has frozen some of its infrastructure subsidies , including roughly 100 million euros -lrb- £ 79m -rrb- for the motorway .
unless the bulgarian government is prepared to replace that money , sofia 's commuters will continue to suffer .
malpractice tackling corruption and organised crime was supposed to be a pre-condition for bulgaria 's membership of the eu .
the number of people being convicted has n't changed - it 's very low and those that are convicted are junior officials yovo nikolov , kapital magazine but just over a year after it joined , three streams of eu funding have been suspended because of apparent fraud , and the eu 's investigating agency has 45 cases of alleged bulgarian malpractice on its books .
" nothing 's changed , " says yovo nikolov , an award-winning investigative reporter for the weekly magazine kapital .
" if there was a real fight against corruption , you would see more corruption convictions from the courts .
" but the number of people being convicted has n't changed - it 's very low and those that are convicted are junior officials .
that shows the authorities are n't tackling it effectively . "
critics have suggested the recent spate of apparent misuse of european funds shows that bulgaria is backsliding on reform , now that it has jumped the hurdles to win membership of the eu .
but the european commission warns it is keeping bulgaria on a short leash .
powerful threat " the european commission is obliged to safeguard the financial interests of all european taxpayers , " says the european commission 's head of representation in sofia , zinaida zlatanova .
" the commission decided to suspend the funds so that the bulgarian authorities will take serious , concrete measures to deal with the issues .
and the commission will do this every time there is even a suspicion of mismanagement . "
bulgaria 's farmers fear corruption could threaten eu funding that threat is a powerful one .
the european commission 's budget for bulgaria for 2007-2013 comes to around 9bn euros .
" the signal that was sent was a very strong one , " says assen arghov , a member of parliament for the opposition democrats for a strong bulgaria .
" people in the european commission may be bureaucrats but they 're very stingy bureaucrats .
the bulgarian authorities are in a panic . "
he claims the eu has now suspended so much funding that bulgaria is paying in more to eu coffers than it gets back - a strange situation for one of the eu 's poorest members .
patience needed but maria anguilieva , an mp from the ruling coalition and the deputy chair of the parliamentary eu affairs committee says europe needs to be a little more patient .
" i think it 's normal one year after accession not to be the best .
we are trying to be the best and we 've achieved a lot in a very short time , " she says .
but in one of sofia 's markets , optimism is wearing thin .
" corruption is not just an everyday thing , it 's an every minute thing , " said one lady , selling shiny red tomatoes to shoppers , stopping off on their way home from work .
" everyone wants money for everything , " agreed a lady on a nearby stall .
" anything you want to do , you need to have connections and you need to give bribes . "
benchmarks the european union imposed a special corruption monitoring scheme on bulgaria , and its neighbour romania , when they joined the eu in january 2007 because it was felt they were not yet up to eu levels .
if bulgaria does not meet specified benchmarks , the eu can impose what it calls safeguard clauses .
under one provision , a quarter of the subsidies which bulgaria 's farmers receive can be held back .
that worries elizabeta bozilova , who is operations manager on one of bulgaria 's largest dairy farms , just outside the second city , plovdiv .
her farm has already received 700,000 euros to help bring the farm up to eu standards .
but she fears corruption could jeopardise future funding .
" it 's difficult to keep the high standards that are demanded , so the money from the eu is really important , " she says .
" i 'm angry because the corruption takes place with officials at a higher level , but we are the ones that need the money . "
pressure is growing on the bulgarian government from farmers , the public , but above all from the eu .
with european public opinion increasingly sceptical about the merits of bringing poor countries like bulgaria into an enlarged european union , brussels needs to prove taxpayers ' money is not going down the drain .

bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw reports from europe 's largest prison - the 3,800-strong fleury-merogis near paris - on how super size prisons work in reality .
as you walk into the main courtyard of maison d 'arret de fleury-merogis , you would be forgiven for thinking you had stumbled into a grim 1960s housing estate : grey concrete walls , walkways , narrow windows and patches of grass .
but look up , and there is a watchtower , with an armed guard keeping look-out .
wires criss-cross the tops of buildings - to stop helicopter escapes - and at the bottom are piles of rubbish , tossed from their cell windows by prisoners .
the sheer size of fleury-merogis adds to the impression of a bleak and desolate place : it occupies 180 hectares , and is split into three sections - for women , juveniles and men .
rusting frames the sprawling men 's block holds around 2,500 prisoners - which itself is bigger than any jail in britain .
the first section of prison to be built in 1968 , the men 's block is divided into five units , each of which contains three wings , four storeys high .
the men 's block feels as if it is a machine warning over prisons plan staff say because the prison is split into separate sections , it is easier to manage , than if everything was in one gigantic building .
but the men 's block feels as if it is a machine ; together , the units form a kind of circle - each wing like spokes in a wheel .
the outdoor facilities - including a sports field - are a plus point , until you remember that some 3,800 people will want to use them .
and they all need to be supervised .
it is not like a relaxing sunday at the park .
inside , the prison appears to be clean and well-ordered .
but the cells i saw were showing their age , with rusting window frames and potentially dangerous sharp-pointed wooden fittings and ligature points .
by 2012 , i was told , they will all be re-fitted , as part of a 400 million euro upgrade .
it can not come soon enough .
the most impressive thing about fleury-merogis were the staff .
working in difficult conditions , dealing with prisoners from 80 different countries , they appeared to me to be courteous , friendly - and disarmingly honest .
one senior officer , bernard gaudicheau , told me about the difficulties of managing large groups of inmates - they are " bolder " and " feel stronger " , he said .
failure ' verdict ' unlocking a cell with one or two inside is very different from having three or four behind the door .
when i asked him to list the advantages of fleury-merogis , the pause was as long as a prison van .
but there was no delay when i asked mr gaudicheau if he judged the prison a success or failure .
" echec , " he replied .
failure .
because fleury-merogis is what in england and wales would be called a " local " prison , housing prisoners for up to a year , on remand , during their trial and immediately after sentence , there is not much time for officers to cement relationships with them .
the problem is made worse in a big , impersonal jail , with a rapid staff turnover .
prowling prisoners officers also complain that there is no time for prisoners to learn skills or languages - 35 % are from outside france .
prison officials told me the record on disorder , self-harm and suicide compares favourably to other jails .
but i was struck by the number of prisoners allowed out for exercise together - a recipe for trouble .
some of the prisoners were huddled together in the shadows , while others prowled under the walkways , out of sight of the officers on look-out duty .
the governor , joaquim pueyo , admitted that group activities in the courtyard can sometimes be hard to manage .
some prisoners refuse to go out , some are too scared , he said .
new cctv cameras will help .
the acid test of whether a prison works is whether the governor would recommend it to others .
overcrowding crisis so , sitting across a boardroom table at his office in the administration block , i put the question to mr pueyo : if british government ministers sought advice on the prison building programme , what would he say ?
his brow furrowed and his eyes focused on the table .
" six cents places , " he said .
the maximum number of places should be 600 - that was his recommendation .
this , by the way , is the size of prison the french are now building to tackle their own overcrowding crisis .
in france , at least , there will be no new jails like fleury-merogis .

government figures show that 100,000 more people are employed now than in 1998 , with a total of 782,000 in work .
in the same period , unemployment has fallen from 63,000 -lrb- 8.1 % -rrb- to 34,000 -lrb- 4.2 % -rrb- .
in the past decade , the construction industry has shown dramatic growth , but the manufacturing sector experienced the loss of 18,000 jobs since 1998 .
some of the decline in manufacturing jobs is due to the erosion of traditional industries such as textiles .
another key factor has been a steady growth in productivity .
there may be widespread agreement of the existence of a feelgood factor in northern ireland , but behind the statistics lies the fact that pay has n't grown to match the upward employment curve .
more people have jobs , but the average income earned remains significantly behind that of great britain at 81 % of the uk average , a figure that causes concern to frank bryan , chairman of the institute of directors in northern ireland .
" yes , progress has been made but we have very serious worries about the quality of employment on offer .
we have graduates coming out of our education system and being underemployed , poorly paid and not being given the opportunities to fully utilise their talents , " he said .
" sometimes it suits the british government to point at the figures and say the job is done but there are severe weaknesses in our employment structure .
" the local executive is coming up with some well-thought out strategies , but realistically it could be five years before we see the benefits coming through , " mr bryan said .
the federation of small businesses , which represents more than 7,000 members in northern ireland , says maintaining economic growth will require some key areas to be addressed .
its chairman , wilfred mitchell , points to issues such as the need for rates relief and for a reduction in what he describes as " over zealous rules and regulations " .
" this mountain of red tape is hampering many business owners who are spending up to seven hours a week dealing with many complicated financial and legal matters when they could be concentrating on running and possibly expanding their business , " he said .
mr mitchell also believes a large investment is needed in northern ireland 's roads infrastructure .
" while we applaud the excellent and much needed upgrades on the m1 and m2 , these investments need to be made across our roads system to ensure better , safer and more efficient links for business . "

there may be widespread agreement of the existence of a feelgood factor in northern ireland , but behind the statistics lies the fact that pay has n't grown to match the upward employment curve .
more people have jobs , but the average income earned remains significantly behind that of great britain at 81 % of the uk average , a figure that causes concern to frank bryan , chairman of the institute of directors in northern ireland .
" yes , progress has been made but we have very serious worries about the quality of employment on offer .
we have graduates coming out of our education system and being underemployed , poorly paid and not being given the opportunities to fully utilise their talents , " he said .
" sometimes it suits the british government to point at the figures and say the job is done but there are severe weaknesses in our employment structure .
" the local executive is coming up with some well-thought out strategies , but realistically it could be five years before we see the benefits coming through , " mr bryan said .
the federation of small businesses , which represents more than 7,000 members in northern ireland , says maintaining economic growth will require some key areas to be addressed .
its chairman , wilfred mitchell , points to issues such as the need for rates relief and for a reduction in what he describes as " over zealous rules and regulations " .
" this mountain of red tape is hampering many business owners who are spending up to seven hours a week dealing with many complicated financial and legal matters when they could be concentrating on running and possibly expanding their business , " he said .
mr mitchell also believes a large investment is needed in northern ireland 's roads infrastructure .
" while we applaud the excellent and much needed upgrades on the m1 and m2 , these investments need to be made across our roads system to ensure better , safer and more efficient links for business . "

a total of 16 libraries will be upgraded in a move to encourage people to make more use of them .
heritage minister rhodri glyn thomas will announce the funding at cwmbran library in torfaen .
state-of-the-art library facilities have been installed at barry and swansea and the new library in central cardiff is due to open next year .
mr thomas said : " libraries are important for our communities , wherever you live .
books are still the core business for our libraries , and over 14.1m books were borrowed last year . "
skills " but they are also important centres of information for the community , and a hive of activity , hosting mother and toddler reading groups , book clubs and providing ict computer training for people who want to develop new skills , " he said .
the new funding means that £ 2.5m would be invested in libraries this year , which includes £ 1.5m for upgrading current library buildings .
the minister also said in 2009 and in 2010 the funding available will go up to £ 3m a year .
he said research showed the poor state of welsh libraries was a " turn-off " for people , but when upgraded , more people used them .
" for example , gorseinon library received a grant of £ 100,000 from the welsh assembly government last year , and in the month following the re-opening visits were up by nine per cent and issues up by 19 % . "
in recent months libraries in gorseinon , brynmawr in blaenau gwent , abertridwr in caerphilly , and caernarfon have been upgraded .
now libraries , including those in cardigan , tredegar , pontarddulais and barmouth will be on the improvement list .

a total of 16 libraries will be upgraded in a move to encourage people to make more use of them .
heritage minister rhodri glyn thomas will announce the funding at cwmbran library in torfaen .
state-of-the-art library facilities have been installed at barry and swansea and the new library in central cardiff is due to open next year .
mr thomas said : " libraries are important for our communities , wherever you live .
books are still the core business for our libraries , and over 14.1m books were borrowed last year . "
skills " but they are also important centres of information for the community , and a hive of activity , hosting mother and toddler reading groups , book clubs and providing ict computer training for people who want to develop new skills , " he said .
the new funding means that £ 2.5m would be invested in libraries this year , which includes £ 1.5m for upgrading current library buildings .
the minister also said in 2009 and in 2010 the funding available will go up to £ 3m a year .
he said research showed the poor state of welsh libraries was a " turn-off " for people , but when upgraded , more people used them .
" for example , gorseinon library received a grant of £ 100,000 from the welsh assembly government last year , and in the month following the re-opening visits were up by nine per cent and issues up by 19 % . "
in recent months libraries in gorseinon , brynmawr in blaenau gwent , abertridwr in caerphilly , and caernarfon have been upgraded .
now libraries , including those in cardigan , tredegar , pontarddulais and barmouth will be on the improvement list .

and we need to know just how much .
the next time you want to search for something on the web , try going to www.blackle.com instead of your usual search engine .
the page you get looks remarkably like google , and queries are fed through to google , but there 's one obvious difference .
instead of the generous amount of white space which has characterised google 's home page since its 1998 launch , the page is mostly black .
heap media , the australian company behind blackle , claims black pixels take less power than white and so using its search saves energy .
it believes that small things matter when it comes to reducing our energy use , limiting our co2 output and reducing the likely extent of global warming as a result of human activity .
whether or not turning off a few million white pixels makes a measurable difference is debatable , and google has challenged the assumptions behind blackle , especially when it comes to lcd screens .
it seems to matter for old-style crt monitors but not for flat screens , according to a paper written in 2002 by judy roberson and others which noted : " among the few lcd monitors in the table , the power used to display a white screen is indistinguishable from power used to display the desktop .
" thus , it appears that display color is a significant determinant of on power for crts , but not for lcds . "
perhaps we should develop a network energy protocol that lets servers and services report their electricity consumption in real time , so i can change my usage patterns .
bill thompson the main factor controlling energy consumption for lcds is the backlighting .
something well known by anyone who has turned down screen brightness and seen the battery life on their laptop take a leap .
so blackle , for all its good intentions , may have saved a few kilos of carbon for heavy google users with old monitors , but it ca n't be used to salve the consciences of the laptop warriors .
which is perhaps a shame as there seems to be a lot to feel guilty about .
in december 2006 commentator nick carr published a widely-read and deeply-contested claim that each active ' avatar ' in second life used as much electricity as the average person living in brazil , noting that ' avatars are n't quite as intangible as they seem .
they do n't have bodies , but they do leave footprints ' .
the calculations carr relied on were rough and ready , as he admitted , and although the headline figure lives on in the blogosphere the real power use seems to be a lot lower , but his claim did get many people to think about their energy use for the first time .
now steve souders , the author of the excellent ' high performance web sites ' , has taken the debate a stage further by looking at the power consumption implications of poorly-designed web pages .
he picks on wikipedia , where the home page has thirteen images that must be fetched over the network every time the page is viewed .
spending time online can mean sucking up a lot of power he argues that this inefficiency costs 5000 kwh -lrb- kilowatt hours -rrb- per year , or around 2000kg of co2 , arguing that making pages faster is ' good for your users , good for you , and good for mother earth ' .
i 'll see if i can make my home page more efficient , if that will save the planet , but of course there is always the sense that whatever i do on my personal site does n't matter because my life 's entire carbon savings will be wiped out the next time a thoughtless rockstar or self-important silicon valley executive flies across the atlantic in their personal jet .
we need a way to show that what we do at a personal level counts , because the actions of millions will make a difference , and it may be that the network is the best way to get that information .
a number of big hi-tech companies have started to take green computing seriously , offering processors and systems that consume less power .
as part of a project it calls ' big green ' , a play on its nickname of ' big blue ' , ibm has been adding energy-monitoring technology to its mainframe computers , letting those with a system z9 have access to what it calls a ' mainframe gas gauge ' .
this is similar to electricity display devices like the wattson , showing how much power a home or office is using .
smarter electricity meters could help lower energy use once you know how much energy is being used you can reduce electricity consumption by turning things off or , in the case of a multi-million dollar computer centre , changing the way jobs are scheduled so that more efficient use is made of the resources available .
but what we really want are smart meters that do more than simply report electricity use but also allow some feedback .

the next time you want to search for something on the web , try going to www.blackle.com instead of your usual search engine .
the page you get looks remarkably like google , and queries are fed through to google , but there 's one obvious difference .
instead of the generous amount of white space which has characterised google 's home page since its 1998 launch , the page is mostly black .
heap media , the australian company behind blackle , claims black pixels take less power than white and so using its search saves energy .
it believes that small things matter when it comes to reducing our energy use , limiting our co2 output and reducing the likely extent of global warming as a result of human activity .
whether or not turning off a few million white pixels makes a measurable difference is debatable , and google has challenged the assumptions behind blackle , especially when it comes to lcd screens .
it seems to matter for old-style crt monitors but not for flat screens , according to a paper written in 2002 by judy roberson and others which noted : " among the few lcd monitors in the table , the power used to display a white screen is indistinguishable from power used to display the desktop .

the calculations carr relied on were rough and ready , as he admitted , and although the headline figure lives on in the blogosphere the real power use seems to be a lot lower , but his claim did get many people to think about their energy use for the first time .
now steve souders , the author of the excellent ' high performance web sites ' , has taken the debate a stage further by looking at the power consumption implications of poorly-designed web pages .
he picks on wikipedia , where the home page has thirteen images that must be fetched over the network every time the page is viewed .
spending time online can mean sucking up a lot of power he argues that this inefficiency costs 5000 kwh -lrb- kilowatt hours -rrb- per year , or around 2000kg of co2 , arguing that making pages faster is ' good for your users , good for you , and good for mother earth ' .
i 'll see if i can make my home page more efficient , if that will save the planet , but of course there is always the sense that whatever i do on my personal site does n't matter because my life 's entire carbon savings will be wiped out the next time a thoughtless rockstar or self-important silicon valley executive flies across the atlantic in their personal jet .
we need a way to show that what we do at a personal level counts , because the actions of millions will make a difference , and it may be that the network is the best way to get that information .
a number of big hi-tech companies have started to take green computing seriously , offering processors and systems that consume less power .
as part of a project it calls ' big green ' , a play on its nickname of ' big blue ' , ibm has been adding energy-monitoring technology to its mainframe computers , letting those with a system z9 have access to what it calls a ' mainframe gas gauge ' .
this is similar to electricity display devices like the wattson , showing how much power a home or office is using .
smarter electricity meters could help lower energy use once you know how much energy is being used you can reduce electricity consumption by turning things off or , in the case of a multi-million dollar computer centre , changing the way jobs are scheduled so that more efficient use is made of the resources available .
but what we really want are smart meters that do more than simply report electricity use but also allow some feedback .

and we need to know just how much .
the next time you want to search for something on the web , try going to www.blackle.com instead of your usual search engine .
the page you get looks remarkably like google , and queries are fed through to google , but there 's one obvious difference .
instead of the generous amount of white space which has characterised google 's home page since its 1998 launch , the page is mostly black .
heap media , the australian company behind blackle , claims black pixels take less power than white and so using its search saves energy .
it believes that small things matter when it comes to reducing our energy use , limiting our co2 output and reducing the likely extent of global warming as a result of human activity .
whether or not turning off a few million white pixels makes a measurable difference is debatable , and google has challenged the assumptions behind blackle , especially when it comes to lcd screens .
it seems to matter for old-style crt monitors but not for flat screens , according to a paper written in 2002 by judy roberson and others which noted : " among the few lcd monitors in the table , the power used to display a white screen is indistinguishable from power used to display the desktop .
" thus , it appears that display color is a significant determinant of on power for crts , but not for lcds . "
perhaps we should develop a network energy protocol that lets servers and services report their electricity consumption in real time , so i can change my usage patterns .
bill thompson the main factor controlling energy consumption for lcds is the backlighting .
something well known by anyone who has turned down screen brightness and seen the battery life on their laptop take a leap .
so blackle , for all its good intentions , may have saved a few kilos of carbon for heavy google users with old monitors , but it ca n't be used to salve the consciences of the laptop warriors .
which is perhaps a shame as there seems to be a lot to feel guilty about .
in december 2006 commentator nick carr published a widely-read and deeply-contested claim that each active ' avatar ' in second life used as much electricity as the average person living in brazil , noting that ' avatars are n't quite as intangible as they seem .
they do n't have bodies , but they do leave footprints ' .
the calculations carr relied on were rough and ready , as he admitted , and although the headline figure lives on in the blogosphere the real power use seems to be a lot lower , but his claim did get many people to think about their energy use for the first time .

it found that for at least two financial years , earnings at sandcity , which sells o 'neill branded boardwear , had been overstated by about £ 1m .
darren spurling , the managing director of sandcity , has been suspended .
the investigation is continuing .
in january , blacks leisure cut its profit target as boardwear sales fell .
last december the firm appointed a new chief executive , neil gillis , to conduct a strategic review and revive the fortunes of the ailing business , which also trades as millets and snow sports specialist freespirit .

systematically knocking out single genes potentially gives scientists unprecedented control over the processes which cause disease .
us and uk researchers have developed synthetic proteins which can target individual genes quickly , simply and with a high degree of success .
the study appears in proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
the new technique is already being used in trials on a range of diseases . "
the single step process is extremely quick and reliable and opens up exciting possibilities for research and gene therapy " sir aaron klug mrc laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge the regulation of gene expression is controlled by regulatory proteins called transcription factors .
the researchers have created their own synthetic versions of these transcription factors called zinc-finger nucleases .
they can be used to cut into and inactivate a target gene in a very precise way , without affecting other nearby genes .
it is also possible to use a similar approach to activate beneficial genes by introducing new dna at the point where the gene is cut .
zinc-finger proteins were discovered and developed by sir aaron klug , based at the medical research council 's laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge .
his work has been taken on by us firm sangamo biosciences .
precision targeting the targetting of individual genes is currently carried out using a process known as homologous recombination , which involves the exchange of genetic material between the target gene and dna created in the lab .
however , this process is time consuming , can be very elaborate , requiring the insertion of markers into the target gene , and is not always very efficient .
sir aaron said : " the beauty of zinc-finger nucleases lies in their simplicity .
" where other methods are long , arduous and often messy , it is relatively easy to switch off genes using this method .
" the zinc-finger design allows us to target a single gene , while the nuclease disrupts the gene .
" the single step process is extremely quick and reliable and opens up exciting possibilities for research and gene therapy . "
animal trials are already under way to use the technique to knock out the receptor of hiv in immune system t-cells of patients with aids .
if successful this will render the t-cells immune from hiv infection , and enable them to fight disease .
clinical trials to aid patients with blocked blood vessels are also under way .
dr vincent cunliffe , a genetics expert from the university of sheffield , described the technique as " a powerful method for efficiently and selectively inactivating " individual genes .
he said : " this technology will have many applications in future research . "

a disagreement with a creditor , which could not be settled informally , has led to the move .
the studios near bridgend , chaired by lord richard attenborough , have been plagued by problems .
the administrator said he hoped stakeholders would give the project their support .
dragon international studios was not available to comment .
building work on the first of four studios at the 330-acre site near bridgend is due to be finished next month .
the labour councillor for llanharan , geraint hopkins said he was " disappointed " by the news .
" quite a lot of work has already been done , a number of the silent stages have been built and it 's a shame now if the project is in jeopardy because of some difficulties .
i am very hopeful of securing the support of the various stakeholders ... to ensure that the studios can be completed shortly rob lewis , administrator " but i do remain positive for the site , " mr hopkins added .
" i would still like to hope the project can be saved .
" i also think that the site is so strategically important - it 's next to the m4 within the distance of three of wales ' largest cities and potentially for links to a wider area . "
it is owned by dragon international studios and westair properties ltd , both of which are in administration .
administrator rob lewis , a partner with accountancy firm pricewaterhousecoopers , was appointed on friday to tackle the problems .
he said he had a year to sort the issues and potentially could then hand it back to the current directors to run .
in a statement he said : " over the past two weeks , the companies have been trying to reach informal agreements with their creditors but unfortunately , satisfactory arrangements have not been possible .

the levels of private sector investment fell , the number of new businesses were fewer than could have been expected and , most significantly , for a period , there was a high level of emigration , often from the younger generation .
early in the 1970s , the recurring question was ' how much damage will this disruption do to the economy ? '
the images of violence and associated political disagreements dominated , to the exclusion of normal economic processes .
the answers -lrb- misleadingly -rrb- tried to give reassurance .
of course , the economy would quickly recover when stability was restored .
there was no suggestion that political stability would be absent for over 25 years .
developments in the ten years since the good friday agreement point to two complementary conclusions .
first , the scale and pace of the recovery has been dramatic .
second , only by recognising the scale of the recent changes can the severe fracturing of the economy in the two preceding decades be appreciated .
the recovery of the economy can not be simply date-stamped at easter 1998 .
political change was gradual and faltering .
there was a partial build up of confidence in the mid 1990s as the ' cease fires ' were implemented and as smaller signs of political movement emerged .
the signs of economic progress are evident over this longer period .
defining moment good friday 1998 was a conspicuous and defining moment .
business confidence varied , year by year , but a more buoyant trend developed , reaching a high point in 2006 and 2007 , as the political institutions were restored .
the good friday agreement and the associated political developments were necessary , but were not in themselves sufficient to ensure better economic performance .
of key importance in strengthening the economy was restored confidence for people - that the quality of lifestyles would improve - for private sector businesses and for investors , and the re-orientation of public sector policies to strengthen the economy .
the changes have been extensive .
perhaps most notably , northern ireland has enjoyed a big increase in employment , creating two landmark records .
first , unemployment has fallen sharply and the unemployment rate has gone from the highest regional rate in the uk to nearly the lowest .
second , in an unprecedented change of patterns , northern ireland has swopped a pattern of emigration for immigration .
the long history of net emigration has been reversed as people , mainly from other eu countries , have found employment here .
employment in northern ireland has increased by 100,000 people in the last decade .
this was proportionately more than in other regions and 40,000 more than would have matched the overall uk pattern .
private sector investment , particularly in services , retailing and property , has been dramatic .
the main retail multiples have invested extensively as most recently demonstrated by the completion of the £ 400m victoria square development in belfast .
tradable services have attracted external investors in specialist call-centre and it businesses .
perhaps one of the clearest signs of progress has been the enhanced market for property whether commercial , office or housing .
another feature of the past decade has been the reduced levels of employment in manufacturing businesses .
over 18,000 fewer people were in this sector in 2007 than in 1997 .
a small consolation is that this fall of 18 % to 88,000 has been much slower than the 28 % fall across the uk .
the construction industry has defied the ' nay-sayers ' who doubted its ability to increase output to meet the new demand .
construction industry employment and output have stepped up dramatically -lrb- although in late 2007 , there has been a temporary dip in orders for the new-build housing market -rrb- .
the government annual capital programme has more than doubled to reach £ 1.6bn in 2008-9 .
priority policy the ten years since the good friday agreement have given impetus to the more positive role of government in the economy .
the strongest indication of new thinking emerged in the programme for government papers for 2008-2011 , now endorsed by the executive and assembly .
economic development is now acknowledged as a priority policy .
steps to convert the policy into more effective action will be carefully scrutinised .
central questions will lie with the orientation of the strategic investment programme , the revision of the strategy of invest ni in support of higher value added investments , and the sharper focus of the official response to the skills shortages and extra vocational training .
ten years on , life is better , living standards are higher and more people are in active employment .
without the good friday agreement , how much of this would not have happened ?
but one indicator offers a salutary reminder of how much further the economy must improve .
in 1998 , using the normal indicator of gva per head -lrb- gross value added -rrb- , in northern ireland average gva was 80.6 % of the uk average .
in 2007 it is estimated to be 81.4 % .
ten years of better progress has had only a small impact on the relative differences of income , even though employment numbers have improved sharply .
john simpson is a northern ireland-based economics consultant .
he is a former academic at queen 's university , belfast , and his appointments include visiting professor in the school of marketing , entrepreneurship and strategy in the university of ulster , and commissioner for judicial appointments .

first , the scale and pace of the recovery has been dramatic .
second , only by recognising the scale of the recent changes can the severe fracturing of the economy in the two preceding decades be appreciated .
the recovery of the economy can not be simply date-stamped at easter 1998 .
political change was gradual and faltering .
there was a partial build up of confidence in the mid 1990s as the ' cease fires ' were implemented and as smaller signs of political movement emerged .
the signs of economic progress are evident over this longer period .
defining moment good friday 1998 was a conspicuous and defining moment .
business confidence varied , year by year , but a more buoyant trend developed , reaching a high point in 2006 and 2007 , as the political institutions were restored .
the good friday agreement and the associated political developments were necessary , but were not in themselves sufficient to ensure better economic performance .
of key importance in strengthening the economy was restored confidence for people - that the quality of lifestyles would improve - for private sector businesses and for investors , and the re-orientation of public sector policies to strengthen the economy .
the changes have been extensive .
perhaps most notably , northern ireland has enjoyed a big increase in employment , creating two landmark records .
first , unemployment has fallen sharply and the unemployment rate has gone from the highest regional rate in the uk to nearly the lowest .
second , in an unprecedented change of patterns , northern ireland has swopped a pattern of emigration for immigration .
the long history of net emigration has been reversed as people , mainly from other eu countries , have found employment here .
employment in northern ireland has increased by 100,000 people in the last decade .
this was proportionately more than in other regions and 40,000 more than would have matched the overall uk pattern .
private sector investment , particularly in services , retailing and property , has been dramatic .
the main retail multiples have invested extensively as most recently demonstrated by the completion of the £ 400m victoria square development in belfast .
tradable services have attracted external investors in specialist call-centre and it businesses .
perhaps one of the clearest signs of progress has been the enhanced market for property whether commercial , office or housing .
another feature of the past decade has been the reduced levels of employment in manufacturing businesses .
over 18,000 fewer people were in this sector in 2007 than in 1997 .
a small consolation is that this fall of 18 % to 88,000 has been much slower than the 28 % fall across the uk .
the construction industry has defied the ' nay-sayers ' who doubted its ability to increase output to meet the new demand .
construction industry employment and output have stepped up dramatically -lrb- although in late 2007 , there has been a temporary dip in orders for the new-build housing market -rrb- .
the government annual capital programme has more than doubled to reach £ 1.6bn in 2008-9 .
priority policy the ten years since the good friday agreement have given impetus to the more positive role of government in the economy .
the strongest indication of new thinking emerged in the programme for government papers for 2008-2011 , now endorsed by the executive and assembly .
economic development is now acknowledged as a priority policy .
steps to convert the policy into more effective action will be carefully scrutinised .
central questions will lie with the orientation of the strategic investment programme , the revision of the strategy of invest ni in support of higher value added investments , and the sharper focus of the official response to the skills shortages and extra vocational training .
ten years on , life is better , living standards are higher and more people are in active employment .
without the good friday agreement , how much of this would not have happened ?
but one indicator offers a salutary reminder of how much further the economy must improve .
in 1998 , using the normal indicator of gva per head -lrb- gross value added -rrb- , in northern ireland average gva was 80.6 % of the uk average .
in 2007 it is estimated to be 81.4 % .
ten years of better progress has had only a small impact on the relative differences of income , even though employment numbers have improved sharply .

the levels of private sector investment fell , the number of new businesses were fewer than could have been expected and , most significantly , for a period , there was a high level of emigration , often from the younger generation .
northern ireland 's economy has grown in the last ten years early in the 1970s , the recurring question was ' how much damage will this disruption do to the economy ? '
the images of violence and associated political disagreements dominated , to the exclusion of normal economic processes .
the answers -lrb- misleadingly -rrb- tried to give reassurance .
of course , the economy would quickly recover when stability was restored .
there was no suggestion that political stability would be absent for over 25 years .
developments in the ten years since the good friday agreement point to two complementary conclusions .
first , the scale and pace of the recovery has been dramatic .
second , only by recognising the scale of the recent changes can the severe fracturing of the economy in the two preceding decades be appreciated .
the recovery of the economy can not be simply date-stamped at easter 1998 .
political change was gradual and faltering .
there was a partial build up of confidence in the mid 1990s as the ' cease fires ' were implemented and as smaller signs of political movement emerged .
the signs of economic progress are evident over this longer period .
defining moment good friday 1998 was a conspicuous and defining moment .
business confidence varied , year by year , but a more buoyant trend developed , reaching a high point in 2006 and 2007 , as the political institutions were restored .
the good friday agreement and the associated political developments were necessary , but were not in themselves sufficient to ensure better economic performance .
of key importance in strengthening the economy was restored confidence for people - that the quality of lifestyles would improve - for private sector businesses and for investors , and the re-orientation of public sector policies to strengthen the economy .
the changes have been extensive .
perhaps most notably , northern ireland has enjoyed a big increase in employment , creating two landmark records .
first , unemployment has fallen sharply and the unemployment rate has gone from the highest regional rate in the uk to nearly the lowest .
second , in an unprecedented change of patterns , northern ireland has swopped a pattern of emigration for immigration .
the long history of net emigration has been reversed as people , mainly from other eu countries , have found employment here .
employment in northern ireland has increased by 100,000 people in the last decade .
this was proportionately more than in other regions and 40,000 more than would have matched the overall uk pattern .
private sector investment , particularly in services , retailing and property , has been dramatic .
the main retail multiples have invested extensively as most recently demonstrated by the completion of the £ 400m victoria square development in belfast .
tradable services have attracted external investors in specialist call-centre and it businesses .
perhaps one of the clearest signs of progress has been the enhanced market for property whether commercial , office or housing .
another feature of the past decade has been the reduced levels of employment in manufacturing businesses .
over 18,000 fewer people were in this sector in 2007 than in 1997 .
a small consolation is that this fall of 18 % to 88,000 has been much slower than the 28 % fall across the uk .
the construction industry has defied the ' nay-sayers ' who doubted its ability to increase output to meet the new demand .
construction industry employment and output have stepped up dramatically -lrb- although in late 2007 , there has been a temporary dip in orders for the new-build housing market -rrb- .
the government annual capital programme has more than doubled to reach £ 1.6bn in 2008-9 .
priority policy the ten years since the good friday agreement have given impetus to the more positive role of government in the economy .
the strongest indication of new thinking emerged in the programme for government papers for 2008-2011 , now endorsed by the executive and assembly .
economic development is now acknowledged as a priority policy .
steps to convert the policy into more effective action will be carefully scrutinised .
central questions will lie with the orientation of the strategic investment programme , the revision of the strategy of invest ni in support of higher value added investments , and the sharper focus of the official response to the skills shortages and extra vocational training .
ten years on , life is better , living standards are higher and more people are in active employment .
without the good friday agreement , how much of this would not have happened ?
but one indicator offers a salutary reminder of how much further the economy must improve .
in 1998 , using the normal indicator of gva per head -lrb- gross value added -rrb- , in northern ireland average gva was 80.6 % of the uk average .
in 2007 it is estimated to be 81.4 % .

these people , typically young men , have the time , budget and patience to spend hours crafting an empire or honing their skills on a first-person shooter .
but that focus is shifting dramatically thanks to a very simple game that involves creating rows of matching jewels .
when it first appeared in 2001 the game was known as diamond mine but is best known as bejeweled .
since then creator popcap has sold more than 10 million copies of bejeweled and the game has been downloaded more than 150 million times .
name calling in technical terms bejeweled is known as a casual game because it can be played for a few minutes rather than for the hours that games such as world of warcraft demand .
james gwertzman , director of business development at popcap , said just because bejeweled and its ilk can be played for a few minutes at a time does n't mean they are without merit .
" there 's nothing necessarily casual about playing them , " he said .
popcap estimates that players rack up 600 million hours playing its online games every year .
importantly for the gaming industry the people raking up these hours are not traditional gamers .
" popcap players are 65 % female and 70 % of them are over the age of 30 , " said mr gwertzman .
" it 's a demographic that 's been completely and utterly written off as gamers . "
the stellar growth of casual games is making that much less true than it used to be .
figures gathered by the casual games association suggest the industry is growing by 20 % year on year and in 2007 the market for these titles was worth $ 2.25bn.
that growth is fuelled by the fact that almost anyone can play them , playing a level or screen takes a short amount of time , they are on consoles , pcs , phones and dedicated gaming gadgets and are either free or very cheap to buy .
by contrast games for the hard core take time to master , soak up huge amounts of time , are only on consoles or high-end pcs and are expensive .
rising tide bejeweled blazed a trail but since then games such as maple story , diner dash , jewel quest and mystery case files have expanded what can be defined as a casual game .
perhaps the biggest casual gaming success has been nintendo 's wii which in 2007 became the must-have console largely due to its appeal to the young and old who were never likely to spend time with a first-person shooter .
toby rowland , co-founder of casual game site king.com , believes social and technological forces have conspired to bring about the rising interest in casual titles .
the number of people who have grown up with games is increasing meaning there is an ever larger pool of potential players .
more importantly though , he said , were the advances in underlying technology that have made it easier than ever to get good games to people no matter if they are playing on a phone , console or low end pc .
" broadband penetration is one of the big drivers on the industry and the other is the advance in the quality of flash technology itself , " he said .
according to adobe more than 98.8 % of the pcs being used in mature markets can run programs written in flash .
flash was important for more than just making titles look good , said mr rowland , it also helped designers make their creations easy to play but hard to master - one of the key qualities a game needs to maintain interest and keep people coming back .
get the mechanics right and people will return time and again in an attempt to master a game .
on king.com , said mr rowland , the average casual player stays for 40 minutes - a stickiness many other websites would envy .
the latest trend in casual gaming online follows some of the broader movements seen online .
increasing numbers of casual games allow players to take on others , compare scores and strategies and introduce a community element to the experience .
others , based around sites such as kongregate , allow amateur game makers to upload their own creation for others to try .
the ubiquity of flash and other easy to use coding tools has encouraged many to give it a try .
" they do not seem , on the surface , to be that hard to make , but it 's a lot harder than most people think , " warned mr gwertzman .
" there 's no formula here , " he said .
" you can not engineer fun . "
that is something people have to discover for themselves .

these people , typically young men , have the time , budget and patience to spend hours crafting an empire or honing their skills on a first-person shooter .
but that focus is shifting dramatically thanks to a very simple game that involves creating rows of matching jewels .
when it first appeared in 2001 the game was known as diamond mine but is best known as bejeweled .
since then creator popcap has sold more than 10 million copies of bejeweled and the game has been downloaded more than 150 million times .
name calling in technical terms bejeweled is known as a casual game because it can be played for a few minutes rather than for the hours that games such as world of warcraft demand .
james gwertzman , director of business development at popcap , said just because bejeweled and its ilk can be played for a few minutes at a time does n't mean they are without merit .
" there 's nothing necessarily casual about playing them , " he said .
popcap estimates that players rack up 600 million hours playing its online games every year .
the wii has got many more playing video games importantly for the gaming industry the people raking up these hours are not traditional gamers .
" popcap players are 65 % female and 70 % of them are over the age of 30 , " said mr gwertzman .
" it 's a demographic that 's been completely and utterly written off as gamers . "
the stellar growth of casual games is making that much less true than it used to be .
figures gathered by the casual games association suggest the industry is growing by 20 % year on year and in 2007 the market for these titles was worth $ 2.25bn.
that growth is fuelled by the fact that almost anyone can play them , playing a level or screen takes a short amount of time , they are on consoles , pcs , phones and dedicated gaming gadgets and are either free or very cheap to buy .
by contrast games for the hard core take time to master , soak up huge amounts of time , are only on consoles or high-end pcs and are expensive .
rising tide bejeweled blazed a trail but since then games such as maple story , diner dash , jewel quest and mystery case files have expanded what can be defined as a casual game .
perhaps the biggest casual gaming success has been nintendo 's wii which in 2007 became the must-have console largely due to its appeal to the young and old who were never likely to spend time with a first-person shooter .
amateur game makers can now find players for their creations toby rowland , co-founder of casual game site king.com , believes social and technological forces have conspired to bring about the rising interest in casual titles .
the number of people who have grown up with games is increasing meaning there is an ever larger pool of potential players .
more importantly though , he said , were the advances in underlying technology that have made it easier than ever to get good games to people no matter if they are playing on a phone , console or low end pc .
" broadband penetration is one of the big drivers on the industry and the other is the advance in the quality of flash technology itself , " he said .
according to adobe more than 98.8 % of the pcs being used in mature markets can run programs written in flash .
flash was important for more than just making titles look good , said mr rowland , it also helped designers make their creations easy to play but hard to master - one of the key qualities a game needs to maintain interest and keep people coming back .
get the mechanics right and people will return time and again in an attempt to master a game .
on king.com , said mr rowland , the average casual player stays for 40 minutes - a stickiness many other websites would envy .
the latest trend in casual gaming online follows some of the broader movements seen online .
increasing numbers of casual games allow players to take on others , compare scores and strategies and introduce a community element to the experience .
others , based around sites such as kongregate , allow amateur game makers to upload their own creation for others to try .
the ubiquity of flash and other easy to use coding tools has encouraged many to give it a try .
" they do not seem , on the surface , to be that hard to make , but it 's a lot harder than most people think , " warned mr gwertzman .
" there 's no formula here , " he said .
" you can not engineer fun . "
that is something people have to discover for themselves .

these people , typically young men , have the time , budget and patience to spend hours crafting an empire or honing their skills on a first-person shooter .
but that focus is shifting dramatically thanks to a very simple game that involves creating rows of matching jewels .
when it first appeared in 2001 the game was known as diamond mine but is best known as bejeweled .
since then creator popcap has sold more than 10 million copies of bejeweled and the game has been downloaded more than 150 million times .
name calling in technical terms bejeweled is known as a casual game because it can be played for a few minutes rather than for the hours that games such as world of warcraft demand .
james gwertzman , director of business development at popcap , said just because bejeweled and its ilk can be played for a few minutes at a time does n't mean they are without merit .
" there 's nothing necessarily casual about playing them , " he said .
popcap estimates that players rack up 600 million hours playing its online games every year .
the wii has got many more playing video games importantly for the gaming industry the people raking up these hours are not traditional gamers .
" popcap players are 65 % female and 70 % of them are over the age of 30 , " said mr gwertzman .
" it 's a demographic that 's been completely and utterly written off as gamers . "
the stellar growth of casual games is making that much less true than it used to be .
figures gathered by the casual games association suggest the industry is growing by 20 % year on year and in 2007 the market for these titles was worth $ 2.25bn.
that growth is fuelled by the fact that almost anyone can play them , playing a level or screen takes a short amount of time , they are on consoles , pcs , phones and dedicated gaming gadgets and are either free or very cheap to buy .
by contrast games for the hard core take time to master , soak up huge amounts of time , are only on consoles or high-end pcs and are expensive .
rising tide bejeweled blazed a trail but since then games such as maple story , diner dash , jewel quest and mystery case files have expanded what can be defined as a casual game .
perhaps the biggest casual gaming success has been nintendo 's wii which in 2007 became the must-have console largely due to its appeal to the young and old who were never likely to spend time with a first-person shooter .
amateur game makers can now find players for their creations toby rowland , co-founder of casual game site king.com , believes social and technological forces have conspired to bring about the rising interest in casual titles .
the number of people who have grown up with games is increasing meaning there is an ever larger pool of potential players .
more importantly though , he said , were the advances in underlying technology that have made it easier than ever to get good games to people no matter if they are playing on a phone , console or low end pc .
" broadband penetration is one of the big drivers on the industry and the other is the advance in the quality of flash technology itself , " he said .
according to adobe more than 98.8 % of the pcs being used in mature markets can run programs written in flash .
flash was important for more than just making titles look good , said mr rowland , it also helped designers make their creations easy to play but hard to master - one of the key qualities a game needs to maintain interest and keep people coming back .
get the mechanics right and people will return time and again in an attempt to master a game .
on king.com , said mr rowland , the average casual player stays for 40 minutes - a stickiness many other websites would envy .
the latest trend in casual gaming online follows some of the broader movements seen online .
increasing numbers of casual games allow players to take on others , compare scores and strategies and introduce a community element to the experience .
others , based around sites such as kongregate , allow amateur game makers to upload their own creation for others to try .
the ubiquity of flash and other easy to use coding tools has encouraged many to give it a try .
" they do not seem , on the surface , to be that hard to make , but it 's a lot harder than most people think , " warned mr gwertzman .
" there 's no formula here , " he said .
" you can not engineer fun . "
that is something people have to discover for themselves .

after a night of negotiations , five dutch- and french-speaking parties agreed to form a government .
mr leterme 's flemish party won elections in june 2007 but was unable to reach agreement on a coalition .
six months later , an interim government stepped in , led by caretaker prime minister guy verhofstadt .
mr leterme will present his government to king albert ii at the royal palace on thursday .
although no party straddles the divide between dutch-speaking flanders and french-speaking wallonia , the new coalition will include socialists and liberals as well as christian democrats .
" it 's a good deal for a government with balanced measures , " the christian democrat leader told belgian radio .
yves leterme 's initial efforts to form a coalition had foundered because he failed to persuade the french-speaking parties to accept a devolution of power to the regions .
the new government agenda which is still to be approved leaves out references to constitutional reform , concentrating instead on immigration , tax-cuts and pension benefits .

organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- ministers deplored the incursion .
but the us voiced reservations , saying colombia had acted in legitimate self-defence in attacking the rebels .
the oas intervened to calm anger after ecuador and venezuela cut diplomatic ties with bogota and sent troops to their borders with colombia .
after hearing a report from an oas delegation that had visited the site of the incursion and following hours of talks , the foreign ministers finally agreed on a resolution .
drug trafficking the text deplored the " incursion of colombian armed forces and police into ecuadorean territory " on 1 march .
oas charter art 19 : no state or group of states has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other state .
the foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any other form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the state or against its political , economic , and cultural elements .
art 21 : the territory of a state is inviolable ; it may not be the object , even temporarily , of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by another state , directly or indirectly , on any grounds whatever .
no territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognised .
the action was taken " without the knowledge or approval of the ecuadorean government , which constitutes a clear violation of articles 19 and 21 of the oas charter " .
the resolution also referred to colombia 's " clear apology " for its incursion .
it also reiterated the commitment of all countries to tackle " the threat to security arising from irregular groups or criminal organisations , in particular those connected to drug trafficking " .
ecuador 's foreign minister , maria isabel salvador , said it was a " clear victory " for her country 's stance .
she said that ecuador would now evaluate the restoration of diplomatic ties with colombia .
" we achieved our aim of getting co-operation in the fight against criminals , insurgents and terrorists , " said colombian foreign minister fernando araujo .
international force colombia 's military had followed up an air-strike on the camp with an attack by ground forces that killed farc 's second-in-command raul reyes and more than 20 others .
the cross-border raid on the camp in angostura , some 250km -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- north-east of quito , sparked the region 's worst diplomatic row for years .
tensions were subsequently eased at a summit in the dominican republic after which venezuela restored its relations with colombia .
ecuador has proposed that an oas force or un troops be deployed to monitor its border with colombia .
colombian president alvaro uribe has indicated he would not rule out such a proposal .
but oas secretary general jose manuel insulza said that he did not believe such an idea was viable .
the colombian government has said it regrets conducting the cross-border raid but that it was necessary " in the fight against terrorism " .
farc - the revolutionary armed forces of colombia - has been fighting the colombian state for more than four decades , and is viewed by the us and the eu as a terrorist group .

oas charter art 19 : no state or group of states has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other state .
the foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any other form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the state or against its political , economic , and cultural elements .
art 21 : the territory of a state is inviolable ; it may not be the object , even temporarily , of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by another state , directly or indirectly , on any grounds whatever .
no territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognised .
the action was taken " without the knowledge or approval of the ecuadorean government , which constitutes a clear violation of articles 19 and 21 of the oas charter " .
the resolution also referred to colombia 's " clear apology " for its incursion .
it also reiterated the commitment of all countries to tackle " the threat to security arising from irregular groups or criminal organisations , in particular those connected to drug trafficking " .
ecuador 's foreign minister , maria isabel salvador , said it was a " clear victory " for her country 's stance .
she said that ecuador would now evaluate the restoration of diplomatic ties with colombia .
" we achieved our aim of getting co-operation in the fight against criminals , insurgents and terrorists , " said colombian foreign minister fernando araujo .
international force colombia 's military had followed up an air-strike on the camp with an attack by ground forces that killed farc 's second-in-command raul reyes and more than 20 others .
oas delegates from peru , brazil and argentina visited the site the cross-border raid on the camp in angostura , some 250km -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- north-east of quito , sparked the region 's worst diplomatic row for years .
tensions were subsequently eased at a summit in the dominican republic after which venezuela restored its relations with colombia .
ecuador has proposed that an oas force or un troops be deployed to monitor its border with colombia .
colombian president alvaro uribe has indicated he would not rule out such a proposal .
but oas secretary general jose manuel insulza said that he did not believe such an idea was viable .
the colombian government has said it regrets conducting the cross-border raid but that it was necessary " in the fight against terrorism " .
farc - the revolutionary armed forces of colombia - has been fighting the colombian state for more than four decades , and is viewed by the us and the eu as a terrorist group .

montgomeryshire liberal democrats spoke after the publication of extracts from her book on her relationship with him .
party officials said they hoped people would be sympathetic to the mp , given the " intensity " of her interest in him .
the lib dem housing spokesman has said he is taking legal advice on the mail on sunday article based on her book .
mr opik and ms lloyd became a couple in 2002 , were engaged in 2004 , and announced that they would marry in 2005 , but their separation was confirmed the following year .
two months ago ms lloyd married motor racing entrepreneur jonathan ashman in the gwynedd village of portmeirion , and her book , a funny kind of love , will be published in april . "
miss lloyd has also married the millionaire mr jonathan ashman in that time ... it is therefore difficult to understand miss lloyd 's motives for pursuing mr opik in this way " montgomeryshire liberal democrats the mp , who speaks for his party on housing , is now dating gabriela irimia , of the pop duo the cheeky girls .
in a statement , his local party said : " in reference to sian lloyd 's latest comments about lembit opik in the newspapers , he is not at this stage willing to make any specific comment about it until he has taken legal advice over the matter .
" however , it should be noted that it is over one year since miss lloyd decided to end her relationship with mr opik .
" miss lloyd has also married the millionaire mr jonathan ashman in that time .
it is therefore difficult to understand miss lloyd 's motives for pursuing mr opik in this way .
" clearly , mr opik has not responded in like kind and this is very much to lembit 's credit .
" one would hope the public will take a similar and sympathetic view given the extent and intensity of sian lloyd 's continuing interest in mr opik . "
mr opik declined to comment on the article during an interview on sunday with sky tv presenter adam boulton .
" one would hope the public will take a similar and sympathetic view given the extent and intensity of sian lloyd 's continuing interest in mr opik . "

they first crossed paths while recording a charity single for people who had lost limbs in war zones in 1999 .
initially , the ex-beatle and the former model denied having a love affair , saying their relationship was purely professional .
when they finally confirmed they were a couple , in october 2000 , they chose the rather public arena of a television programme to make the announcement . "
i thought he was very cute but it did n't enter my head that he fancied me " heather mills " yeah , i love her , " sir paul admitted on the itv show , stars and their lives , which was paying tribute to mills ' charity work .
the singer-songwriter , now 65 , said he had pursued heather after seeing her at an awards ceremony .
" i found out her telephone number - like you do - and rang her up and said we should talk about some charity stuff and i like what you 're doing . "
mills told the tv programme : " i thought he was very cute but it did n't enter my head that he fancied me .
" at the end of one of the last meetings i got into a lift and just felt these eyes in my back .
" i turned round and saw him peeping round a corner . "
engaged the couple got engaged during a short break in the lake district the following year .
" when i proposed i was a bit nervous but i managed , " sir paul told the press , as mills showed off a diamond and sapphire ring bought on a trip to india .
stories later circulated that the engagement ring had been thrown out of florida hotel room window following a row .
there were also rumours that sir paul 's children from his first marriage , to photographer linda , disapproved of the relationship .
sir paul admitted that his new girlfriend had been a " big shock " for the children .
" she 's actually younger than one of them , " he said , " but i think they dealt with it very well actually " .
lavish wedding the couple tied the knot in ireland under great secrecy in the grounds of castle leslie , county monaghan .
security guards prevented the photographers and journalists from getting a glimpse of the preparations , and only one photograph was released to the press .
three hundred guests , including beatles drummer ringo starr , sir george martin , and all of sir paul 's children , watched the couple exchange vows .
the lavish ceremony involved thousands of pounds ' worth of flowers , and a five-minute firework display , which the newly-weds watched from an island in the castle grounds .
the couple had a child , beatrice , in the autumn of 2003 .
the couple faced repeated press criticism after their wedding , and blamed media intrusion for their eventual separation in may 2006 .
marriage breakdown while they maintained that their parting was " amicable " , press coverage following their split reached fever pitch in what appeared to be a war of words between the two parties .
in august 2006 , mills and her daughter were locked out of sir paul 's london home , and the police were called after her security guard scaled the wall to let her in .
while she laughed off the incident , her spokesman added that the musician had frozen their joint bank account and complained that she had taken three bottles of cleaning fluid from his sussex home .
in october 2006 , the daily mail reported that sir paul had violently abused mills during their marriage , claims it said came from court papers filed on her behalf .
the former beatle sought to contest the allegations , while mills said she would sue over earlier " false , damaging and immensely upsetting " claims connected to the divorce .
she later said she had received death threats and had " felt severely upset and depressed through these six months , but when i lost my leg i did n't " .
in july 2007 , a photographer was found guilty of assaulting mills as he took her picture .
mills ' apparent plans to gain access to the couple 's home also attracted attention .
settlement reached she carried a large pad which on which was written " i am seeking an order for occupation of the matrimonial home " in large letters .
the 40-year-old remained in the public eye , becoming the first contestant with an artificial limb to take part in us show dancing with the stars , making it to the sixth week .
sir paul , meanwhile , continued to play live and released his latest album through the starbucks record label .
the couple 's divorce proceedings finally came to london 's high court in february and were held behind closed doors .
a settlement was reached on 17 march .
full details of the £ 24.3m payout for ms mills have not been made public as she is appealing against publication of the ruling .
she said outside court that details in the ruling could affect the security of her daughter beatrice .
there is a stay in publication of the ruling until the appeal is heard .

" this is solidarity , south american brotherhood , " quipped the condor figure , as he diplomatically cheered for both sides .
' ridiculous and shameful ' last week , fifa , football 's governing body , upheld the ban on international matches in stadiums located higher than 2,750m -lrb- 9,022ft -rrb- above sea level , without a period of acclimatisation .
the ban was introduced amid concerns about the effect on the health of players unaccustomed to thin air .
bolivians believe football should be a question of attitude , not altitude this decision means bolivia can not play qualifying rounds for the 2010 world cup in la paz , which is located 3,600m above sea level .
while this has sparked outrage in bolivia , it might also affect two other andean capitals , bogota and quito .
upon his arrival in la paz , maradona said the ban was " ridiculous and shameful " and a " political issue " .
he accused fifa president sepp blatter of " playing with the passion of the bolivian people " .
during half-time , maradona received the simon bolivar order - bolivia 's highest honour - from mr morales , and addressed the bolivian crowd .
" we have shown fifa that it is possible to run on this pitch , " he said .
" you have the right to play where you were born .
that can not be decided neither by god nor much less by blatter . "
lobs and lobbying while the argentine world cup winner led a team of retired argentine stars , artists and journalists , mr morales played centre-forward for his team of retired bolivian stars .
they included the current deputy minister of sports , milton melgar , who played for bolivia in the 1994 world cup finals in the us .
mr morales , a well-known football fan and quite a skilful player , has lobbied hard for bolivia to be able to continue playing in la paz .
he even played a match at 6,000m last year to show the game could be played at high altitude .
mr morales called the rule " an aggression against the peoples , and aggression against sport " .
" football unites peoples but this decision seems to be confronting peoples .
fifa should revise this offensive decision , " he said .
bolivia will appeal this decision at the next fifa congress , to be held in australia in may .
mr morales is planning to ask for the support of african and european football federations as well as other latin american nations .
bolivia wants playing football to be a question of attitude , not altitude .

about 1,000 of the " most challenging " children will be expected to stick to the order , or risk a criminal record .
children 's secretary ed balls will unveil a £ 218m expansion of family intervention projects in projects across england .
it will stop " bad behaviour spiralling into future offending " , says mr balls .
ministers believe youngsters often graduate from minor offences to more serious bad behaviour , leading to anti-social behaviour orders and criminal records .
these difficult children will be given one-to-one support from a care worker and will have help with specific problems , such as drug abuse .
family breakdown there will be 20 " intensive intervention " pilot projects launched over the next three years under the youth taskforce action plan - based on the model of the existing family intervention projects .
have your say " whoever dreamt this up has not raised young children " phil , glasgow send us your comments youngsters will sign up to a contract which will be monitored by an " assertive and persistent key worker " .
the support linked to to the contract is " non-negotiable " , ministers say .
the plan will " go further to tackle anti-social behaviour by making sure we take strong actions to tackle the underlying causes such as substance abuse and family breakdown , " mr balls is due to say at the scheme 's launch in east london on tuesday .
" recognising these problems does n't condone bad behaviour - nor is it a soft option .
' underlying problems ' " in the end where young people and families do n't accept help to change their behaviour , then the right thing to do is to use anti-social behaviour orders and individual support orders . "
children 's minister beverley hughes said that " the best form of prevention is cure " .
" we can spot early warning signs in young people and families where things are going wrong - poor parenting , lessons skipped and complaints about behaviour .
" to change , rather than just contain , we need tough action on the underlying problems , " said the minister .
she denied the measures would replicate work already being done .
similar projects were targeting youngsters already displaying serious anti-social behaviour but not those who were in danger of getting into that position by , for example , truanting or experimenting with drink or drugs , or were in danger of being drawn into gangs , she said .
' parental skills ' ms hughes said the project would target about 50 youngsters in each of the pilot areas - parts of the country with the biggest anti-social behaviour problems .
she told bbc news : " if you can really work in a very positive way with the 50 most difficult kids who are in danger and turn those kids around then you can have a disproportionately beneficial effect . "
however , youth worker shaun bailey , who is also conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for hammersmith , west london , said the scheme was nothing new .
he said the idea of outside help for wayward youngsters would further reinforce the " dependence " culture and discourage parents from taking responsibility for their children 's actions .
he told bbc news : " we need to change the notion around parenting .
so many parents up and down the country believe it is their divine right not to parent their children properly and there is absolutely no come-back . "
but another youth worker , nathan john , welcomed the plans saying : " early intervention is definitely key , family support is great , especially for parents . "
general secretary of the national union of teachers steve sinnott said a programme of early intervention was the obvious route .
" some of our youngsters lead desperate lives .
it is essential that strategies to tackle the worst behaviour both inside and outside of schools moves on to the front foot .
" asbos may sometimes remove anti-social behaviour and violence from communities but they ca n't tackle its causes . "
he added that , too often , schools have the sole responsibility for sorting out society 's problems .
liberal democrat children 's spokesman david laws accused the government of coming up with a sticking plaster scheme .
he asked : " how effective will this scheme , which is only going to cover 1,000 children in 20 areas , be when we know that tens of thousands of children need both extra support and extra discipline ? "
