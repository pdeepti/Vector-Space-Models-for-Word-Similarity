amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 27.01.2008 kosovo 's shaky economy shows signs of autonomy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy could be the key to economic upswing in kosovo kosovo 's economy , which is plagued by high birth and unemployment rates , relies heavily on the earnings of its diaspora .
but there 's light - and euros - at the end of the tunnel for the break-away serbian province . with an estimated gross national income of $ 1,100 -lrb- 758 euros -rrb- per capita , kosovars ' income is similar to that of people in ethiopia and zambia - and 10 times lower than bulgaria and romania , the european union 's newest members . this month , both the united nations and the eu are independently rethinking the future of their involvement in the province , which has been under un administration and nato protection since a war ended in 1999 .
meanwhile , the albanian majority expects its politicians in pristina to declare independence from serbia - as they promised in their december campaigns . too few jobs for growing labor pool but rebuilding kosovo 's economy wo n't be an easy task when confronted with the following statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 18 percent of the population is undernourished half of the population does n't get enough to eat , political scientist behlul beqaj estimated , and there are n't enough jobs to go around .
a third of its 2 million residents are under the age of 14 .
each year more job-seekers flood the labor market as birth rates soar beyond european records . unemployment is at about 330,000 .
of those who have jobs , many work in the public sector , which is the largest employer .
people who work for international organizations earn the highest salaries .
the private sector consists mainly of shops and most businesses employ only two or three people at minimum wage . emigres are kosovo 's life-blood the rest of the population tries to make a modest living on the black market and waits for money transfers from relatives abroad .
some 375,000 of kosovo ethnic albanians live and work in the united states , germany or switzerland .
in total , emigres send as much as 450 million euros back home each year , which represents half of kosovo 's entire budget . " i do n't know how we would survive without this money source , " said economist ibrahim rexhepi .
" we import 1.5 billion euros worth of goods but hardly export 150 million euros worth . " rexhepi said opening the market for foreign investment would ease the situation , as would opening the borders for jobless kosovars to seek employment abroad . a light in the dark despite the dire conditions , the province 's energy sector is seen as a ray of hope .
even though kosovo 's electric company only produces 800 megawatts of electricity each day , 80 percent of what 's needed , and it ca n't afford to buy more from neighboring countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is the official currency in kosovo nevertheless , bids will be accepted this year from international companies vying for a chance to build the province 's third coal plant .
an estimated 15 billion tons of brown coal lie in the earth beneath kosovo .
the ground is also though to contain 20 billion tons of lead and zinc and 15 billion tons of nickel . " thanks to the large coal deposits , kosovo should be able to export electricity , " said nezir sinanin , spokesman for the kosovo c power plant , which is hoping to up output to 2,100 megawatts by 2014 . serbia remains kosovo 's most important trade partner , along with macedonia and croatia , though the serbian government has already threatened an embargo if kosovo declares independence . that would mean a price increase of at least 10 percent , while prices in pristina - where the euro is the official currency - are already comparable to those in the eu . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de kosovo is n't going to wait forever , says german general the german commander in kosovo , robert bund , told dw-world.de that the people of kosovo expect a lot from europe and the us .
he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- serbian voters lean toward nationalist in presidential election as expected , serbia 's presidential election next month 's election will be a showdown between boris tadic , a pro-western candidate , and a nationalist tomislav nikolic , who favors closer ties to russia .

22 , from germany to venezuela .
its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .
the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .

22 , from germany to venezuela .
its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .
the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .
they intend to fit 1,500 ships with the sails by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , from germany to venezuela .
its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .
the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .
they intend to fit 1,500 ships with the sails by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 27.01.2008 kosovo 's shaky economy shows signs of autonomy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy could be the key to economic upswing in kosovo kosovo 's economy , which is plagued by high birth and unemployment rates , relies heavily on the earnings of its diaspora .
but there 's light - and euros - at the end of the tunnel for the break-away serbian province . with an estimated gross national income of $ 1,100 -lrb- 758 euros -rrb- per capita , kosovars ' income is similar to that of people in ethiopia and zambia - and 10 times lower than bulgaria and romania , the european union 's newest members . this month , both the united nations and the eu are independently rethinking the future of their involvement in the province , which has been under un administration and nato protection since a war ended in 1999 .
meanwhile , the albanian majority expects its politicians in pristina to declare independence from serbia - as they promised in their december campaigns . too few jobs for growing labor pool but rebuilding kosovo 's economy wo n't be an easy task when confronted with the following statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 18 percent of the population is undernourished half of the population does n't get enough to eat , political scientist behlul beqaj estimated , and there are n't enough jobs to go around .
a third of its 2 million residents are under the age of 14 .
each year more job-seekers flood the labor market as birth rates soar beyond european records . unemployment is at about 330,000 .
of those who have jobs , many work in the public sector , which is the largest employer .
people who work for international organizations earn the highest salaries .
the private sector consists mainly of shops and most businesses employ only two or three people at minimum wage . emigres are kosovo 's life-blood the rest of the population tries to make a modest living on the black market and waits for money transfers from relatives abroad .
some 375,000 of kosovo ethnic albanians live and work in the united states , germany or switzerland .
in total , emigres send as much as 450 million euros back home each year , which represents half of kosovo 's entire budget . " i do n't know how we would survive without this money source , " said economist ibrahim rexhepi .
" we import 1.5 billion euros worth of goods but hardly export 150 million euros worth . " rexhepi said opening the market for foreign investment would ease the situation , as would opening the borders for jobless kosovars to seek employment abroad . a light in the dark despite the dire conditions , the province 's energy sector is seen as a ray of hope .
even though kosovo 's electric company only produces 800 megawatts of electricity each day , 80 percent of what 's needed , and it ca n't afford to buy more from neighboring countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is the official currency in kosovo nevertheless , bids will be accepted this year from international companies vying for a chance to build the province 's third coal plant .
an estimated 15 billion tons of brown coal lie in the earth beneath kosovo .
the ground is also though to contain 20 billion tons of lead and zinc and 15 billion tons of nickel . " thanks to the large coal deposits , kosovo should be able to export electricity , " said nezir sinanin , spokesman for the kosovo c power plant , which is hoping to up output to 2,100 megawatts by 2014 . serbia remains kosovo 's most important trade partner , along with macedonia and croatia , though the serbian government has already threatened an embargo if kosovo declares independence . that would mean a price increase of at least 10 percent , while prices in pristina - where the euro is the official currency - are already comparable to those in the eu . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de kosovo is n't going to wait forever , says german general the german commander in kosovo , robert bund , told dw-world.de that the people of kosovo expect a lot from europe and the us .
he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- serbian voters lean toward nationalist in presidential election as expected , serbia 's presidential election next month 's election will be a showdown between boris tadic , a pro-western candidate , and a nationalist tomislav nikolic , who favors closer ties to russia .
-lrb- 21.01.2008 -rrb- germany and serbia hope for swift deal on eu trade pact the foreign ministers of germany and serbia said that they were hoping that the balkan nation would soon be able to sign up to a key aid and trade pact with the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment transportation -pipe- 27.01.2008 kite-pulled ship saves big by going retro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sail flies at a height of about 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- the world 's first kite-powered cargo ship set sail on tuesday , jan .
22 , from germany to venezuela .
its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .
the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .
they intend to fit 1,500 ships with the sails by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , from germany to venezuela .
its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .
the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .
they intend to fit 1,500 ships with the sails by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 27.01.2008 slovenian press freedom is suffering , journalists say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this ljubljana kiosk is full of news - but are they balanced ?
amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .

" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .

" during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .

experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .

its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 27.01.2008 kosovo 's shaky economy shows signs of autonomy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy could be the key to economic upswing in kosovo kosovo 's economy , which is plagued by high birth and unemployment rates , relies heavily on the earnings of its diaspora .
but there 's light - and euros - at the end of the tunnel for the break-away serbian province . with an estimated gross national income of $ 1,100 -lrb- 758 euros -rrb- per capita , kosovars ' income is similar to that of people in ethiopia and zambia - and 10 times lower than bulgaria and romania , the european union 's newest members . this month , both the united nations and the eu are independently rethinking the future of their involvement in the province , which has been under un administration and nato protection since a war ended in 1999 .
meanwhile , the albanian majority expects its politicians in pristina to declare independence from serbia - as they promised in their december campaigns . too few jobs for growing labor pool but rebuilding kosovo 's economy wo n't be an easy task when confronted with the following statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 18 percent of the population is undernourished half of the population does n't get enough to eat , political scientist behlul beqaj estimated , and there are n't enough jobs to go around .
a third of its 2 million residents are under the age of 14 .
each year more job-seekers flood the labor market as birth rates soar beyond european records . unemployment is at about 330,000 .
of those who have jobs , many work in the public sector , which is the largest employer .
people who work for international organizations earn the highest salaries .
the private sector consists mainly of shops and most businesses employ only two or three people at minimum wage . emigres are kosovo 's life-blood the rest of the population tries to make a modest living on the black market and waits for money transfers from relatives abroad .
some 375,000 of kosovo ethnic albanians live and work in the united states , germany or switzerland .
in total , emigres send as much as 450 million euros back home each year , which represents half of kosovo 's entire budget . " i do n't know how we would survive without this money source , " said economist ibrahim rexhepi .
" we import 1.5 billion euros worth of goods but hardly export 150 million euros worth . " rexhepi said opening the market for foreign investment would ease the situation , as would opening the borders for jobless kosovars to seek employment abroad . a light in the dark despite the dire conditions , the province 's energy sector is seen as a ray of hope .
even though kosovo 's electric company only produces 800 megawatts of electricity each day , 80 percent of what 's needed , and it ca n't afford to buy more from neighboring countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is the official currency in kosovo nevertheless , bids will be accepted this year from international companies vying for a chance to build the province 's third coal plant .
an estimated 15 billion tons of brown coal lie in the earth beneath kosovo .
the ground is also though to contain 20 billion tons of lead and zinc and 15 billion tons of nickel . " thanks to the large coal deposits , kosovo should be able to export electricity , " said nezir sinanin , spokesman for the kosovo c power plant , which is hoping to up output to 2,100 megawatts by 2014 . serbia remains kosovo 's most important trade partner , along with macedonia and croatia , though the serbian government has already threatened an embargo if kosovo declares independence . that would mean a price increase of at least 10 percent , while prices in pristina - where the euro is the official currency - are already comparable to those in the eu . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- serbian voters lean toward nationalist in presidential election as expected , serbia 's presidential election next month 's election will be a showdown between boris tadic , a pro-western candidate , and a nationalist tomislav nikolic , who favors closer ties to russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 27.01.2008 slovenian press freedom is suffering , journalists say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this ljubljana kiosk is full of news - but are they balanced ?
amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , from germany to venezuela .
its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .

the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 27.01.2008 slovenian press freedom is suffering , journalists say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this ljubljana kiosk is full of news - but are they balanced ?
amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .

the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output .

experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 27.01.2008 kosovo 's shaky economy shows signs of autonomy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy could be the key to economic upswing in kosovo kosovo 's economy , which is plagued by high birth and unemployment rates , relies heavily on the earnings of its diaspora .
but there 's light - and euros - at the end of the tunnel for the break-away serbian province . with an estimated gross national income of $ 1,100 -lrb- 758 euros -rrb- per capita , kosovars ' income is similar to that of people in ethiopia and zambia - and 10 times lower than bulgaria and romania , the european union 's newest members . this month , both the united nations and the eu are independently rethinking the future of their involvement in the province , which has been under un administration and nato protection since a war ended in 1999 .
meanwhile , the albanian majority expects its politicians in pristina to declare independence from serbia - as they promised in their december campaigns . too few jobs for growing labor pool but rebuilding kosovo 's economy wo n't be an easy task when confronted with the following statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 18 percent of the population is undernourished half of the population does n't get enough to eat , political scientist behlul beqaj estimated , and there are n't enough jobs to go around .
a third of its 2 million residents are under the age of 14 .
each year more job-seekers flood the labor market as birth rates soar beyond european records . unemployment is at about 330,000 .
of those who have jobs , many work in the public sector , which is the largest employer .
people who work for international organizations earn the highest salaries .
the private sector consists mainly of shops and most businesses employ only two or three people at minimum wage . emigres are kosovo 's life-blood the rest of the population tries to make a modest living on the black market and waits for money transfers from relatives abroad .
some 375,000 of kosovo ethnic albanians live and work in the united states , germany or switzerland .
in total , emigres send as much as 450 million euros back home each year , which represents half of kosovo 's entire budget . " i do n't know how we would survive without this money source , " said economist ibrahim rexhepi .
" we import 1.5 billion euros worth of goods but hardly export 150 million euros worth . " rexhepi said opening the market for foreign investment would ease the situation , as would opening the borders for jobless kosovars to seek employment abroad . a light in the dark despite the dire conditions , the province 's energy sector is seen as a ray of hope .
even though kosovo 's electric company only produces 800 megawatts of electricity each day , 80 percent of what 's needed , and it ca n't afford to buy more from neighboring countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is the official currency in kosovo nevertheless , bids will be accepted this year from international companies vying for a chance to build the province 's third coal plant .
an estimated 15 billion tons of brown coal lie in the earth beneath kosovo .
the ground is also though to contain 20 billion tons of lead and zinc and 15 billion tons of nickel . " thanks to the large coal deposits , kosovo should be able to export electricity , " said nezir sinanin , spokesman for the kosovo c power plant , which is hoping to up output to 2,100 megawatts by 2014 . serbia remains kosovo 's most important trade partner , along with macedonia and croatia , though the serbian government has already threatened an embargo if kosovo declares independence . that would mean a price increase of at least 10 percent , while prices in pristina - where the euro is the official currency - are already comparable to those in the eu . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de kosovo is n't going to wait forever , says german general the german commander in kosovo , robert bund , told dw-world.de that the people of kosovo expect a lot from europe and the us .
he said the situation in the serbian province remains calm but not stable .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- serbian voters lean toward nationalist in presidential election as expected , serbia 's presidential election next month 's election will be a showdown between boris tadic , a pro-western candidate , and a nationalist tomislav nikolic , who favors closer ties to russia .
-lrb- 21.01.2008 -rrb- germany and serbia hope for swift deal on eu trade pact the foreign ministers of germany and serbia said that they were hoping that the balkan nation would soon be able to sign up to a key aid and trade pact with the european union .

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "

journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .

" " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .

its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .

experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .
dozens of journalists left the state-run organization in protest .
other criticisms are aimed at indirect influence of business on news .
the delo publishing company , which in addition to putting out the biggest national daily is also responsible for numerous smaller papers , is said to be under pressure to make agreements with businesses about the newspapers ' content .
too-close ties between business and news ?
delo 's biggest stockholder is the lasko brewery .
lasko was able to purchase state-run supermarket company mercator - thanks to good government contacts , many say .
according to some slovenian journalists , lasko paid the government back by influencing the editorial policies of delo 's newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia has been a poster child for eu press freedom up to now the director of the international press institute , johann fritz , warned in an official statement that " business contacts and stock ownership should not be used by the government to influence independent media into publishing positive articles . "
but grah , the vienna correspondent for delo , said there are now only two papers - dnevnik and mladina - that are not subject to state influence .
those news outlets are suffering from a lack of advertising , however .
big companies have pulled their ads from the critical newspapers , costing them a significant portion of their revenues .
in order to answer the critics , the ministry of culture funded a study at the university of ljubljana , on press freedom .
the researchers found that the reporting in slovenian papers was even-handed , but sociologist matej makarovic , who conducted the research , found that the government and other political parties had tried to influence it . leila knüppel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid layoffs of controversial journalists and falling ad revenue for media that are critical of the government , there are growing complaints that slovenia 's once-enviable press freedom is suffering . matija grah , the vienna correspondent of slovenia 's biggest daily newspaper , delo , said he was ordered back home and fired shortly after he wrote a commentary critical of his government 's foreign policy .
" formally , it was the editor-in-chief who did the job , " grah said .
" but it was clearly a political move .
the foreign minister had called the editor in chief . "
press freedom in slovenia is increasingly threatened , said grah , who together with a group of journalists has started an initiative for press freedom in the country .
they accuse slovenian prime minister janez jansa and his government of seriously violating the freedom of the press .
accusation of " systematic attack " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists accuse pm jansa of having an iron fist .
" of course , politicians have always tried to influence the press , and politicians have made phone calls to previous editors-in-chief , " he said .
" but this government is systematically attacking the media . "
in a letter to the prime ministers of eu member countries , grah wrote : " censorship in slovenia 's media shows itself in many different ways .
journalists who criticized the government have been transferred , laid off , stripped of their duties , and hampered in doing their work . "
now , some of the concerned journalists are demanding an international commission to thoroughly examine the issues of media censorship .
up to now , 517 journalists have signed a complaint document .
government reacts swiftly to critics the political leadership answered quickly : prime minister jansa accused the group of " exporting lies , " and told them that , if they kept it up , they would damage the country 's international reputation .
the fight between the government and journalists has been brewing since the 2004 elections , when the new conservative government enacted a broadcasting law .
the law determines who will get a seat on the programming committee for national radio and television .
the plan required a majority vote in parliament .
as a result , the heads of the tv and radio broadcasters were exchanged , and slovenia 's press angency , sta , got a new leadership - alenka paulin , one-time press secretary for jansa 's cabinet .

22 , from germany to venezuela .
its makers hope to prove that using earth-friendly energy can also mean saving a fortune . sailboats are anything but modern - unless we 're talking about the ms beluga skysails , which is now chugging across the atlantic ocean with the help of a 160-square-meter -lrb- 1,722-square-foot -rrb- computer-controlled kite . the contraption 's inventor , 35-year-old stephen wrage , said supplementing the ship 's diesel engine with wind power should cut its daily fuel bill by 20 percent - at a time when oil has exceeded $ 90 -lrb- 62 euros -rrb- a barrel . turning to alternative energy sources like wind power , an ancient tool in ocean travel , also reduces the ship 's co2 output . " during the next few months , we will finally be able to prove that our technology works in practice and significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions , " said wrage , founder and president of the hamburg-based company skysails . the kite , shaped like a paraglider , flies up to 300 meters -lrb- 980 feet -rrb- high to be able to pull the 10,000-ton vessel .
it cost about 500,000 euros to make , not counting the five years of research wrage and his colleagues put into it . yield for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's 55,000 cargo ships transport 90 percent of its goods though freight ships are the world 's most important commercial transport method , carrying 90 percent of all traded goods , they were excluded from the un 's climate agreement , the kyoto protocol .
experts have advocated that the industry - which produced 5 percent of the world 's total carbon emissions - be included in the successor treaty , to take effect after kyoto expires in 2012 . but as long as oil prices remain high , ship companies already have a hefty incentive to reduce their fuel consumption .
many have already made effective efforts to save fuel by mandating slower speeds in their fleets . hamburg-based logistics company hapag-lloyd , for example , reduced the standard speed of its ships from 23.5 to 20 knots in the second half of last year and reported " significant savings . " " before , ships would speed up to 25 knots from the standard 23.5 to make up if time was lost in crowded ports , " said company spokesman klaus heims .
" we calculated that five knots slower saves up to 50 percent in fuel and it had the added effect of cutting carbon dioxide emissions immediately . " more sail , more savings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sails will have to get a lot bigger before they can be used commercially there are lots more ways for ships to push down their fuel consumption and drive up their savings , hermann klein from germanischer lloyd classification society told reuters news agency . using weather forecasts to select optimal routes , cleaning the ships regularly to remove sediments that would cause resistance and using fuel additives for better performance would benefit the company 's budget and the earth , klein said , adding that opting for slower-speed engines with greater fuel efficiency makes more sense than running high-power engines at a slower pace . wrage and his skysails company , however , expect many shipping firms to choose kite power , should the maiden voyage turn out to be a success . larger kites could cut fuel usage by 30 to 50 percent , wrage said .
the company hopes to double the size of the kites to 320 square meters and then expand them again to 600 square meters by 2009 .
they intend to fit 1,500 ships with the sails by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the democratic race , held on 26 january , was won convincingly by barack obama with 55 % of the vote , well ahead of his main rival , hillary clinton .
his success was mainly due to scooping up some 80 % of the votes from the state 's african-american community , which constitutes half of the primary electorate .
john edwards , for his part , was unable to repeat his winning performance in the 2004 presidential primary .
aware that the state could be seen as a test of his ability to attract black voters , mr obama spent considerably more than mrs clinton in south carolina in early 2007 , but by the end of the year she was matching his expenditure .
the state has pockets of rural poverty , as well as a large industrial base , and voters - both black and white - tend to cite job creation and healthcare as their top priorities .
