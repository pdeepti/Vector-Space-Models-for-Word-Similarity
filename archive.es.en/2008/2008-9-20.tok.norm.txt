radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

lectures , exhibitions , festivals and concerts will be held at various places in the coming years up to 2017 , the anniversary of luther 's posting of his theses .
" we 're expecting a few thousand people from all over the world at the weekend , " said johannes winkelmann , director of the cultural society wittenbergkultur .
the guests will include numerous prominent theologians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle church in wittenberg will play a special part in luther decade celebrations mark hanson , president of the lutheran world federation and a resident of chicago , will give the sermon at sunday 's special church service - in the schlosskirche , naturally .
before that , however , wittenberg theologian friedrich schorlemmer and christopf stoelzl , previously berlin 's top cultural official , will engage in a disputation titled " jesus was revolutionary ; the church became conservative . "
the venue is the lutherhaus , the house where luther lived which is now a museum on the reformation .
a cycling trio will help kick off the luther decade by retracing luther 's path .
on friday , ralf grabsch , a tour de france participant who was born near wittenberg , and two other cyclists plan to set off for wittenberg from st augustine 's monastery in erfurt .
luther joined the augustinian monastery in 1505 after having been nearly struck dead by lightning .
he took his monastic vows in 1506 and began studying theology in erfurt in 1507 .
plenty of wine and music will also help mark the passing of half a millennium since luther 's arrival in wittenberg .
a " monastery fete " is scheduled saturday in the courtyard of the lutherhaus .
visitors can have guided tours of the house and seminary .
luther town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wittenberg market place will be abuzz with visitors come luther decade the lutherhaus is on unesco 's world heritage list , along with the local church , the schlosskirche , and the house of philipp melanchthon , luther 's friend and fellow protestant reformer .
wittenberg 's chief industry is luther-oriented tourism - the city draws about 400,000 visitors each year - which it aims to boost during the luther decade .
among the special events planned for next year is a conference on a commemoration of the reformation in east and west germany , a play called luther / chess , and regular orations in the local church on the theme of the seven days of creation . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 . kfw , a government bank that administers federal shareholdings and passes out soft loans to home-owners , was dubbed " germany 's dumbest bank " by the mass-circulation newspaper bild when the scandal broke .
the automated payment on monday went out just hours before lehman declared itself insolvent .
lehman did not settle the swap with the equivalent in us currency , 500 million dollars , leaving kfw in the queue as a creditor .
quoting banking sources , the german weekly magazine focus said kfw had asked a frankfurt law firm , clifford , to study if it could sack or bring a prosecution against executives responsible for the blunder .
asked to confirm the story , a kfw spokeswoman told the dpa news agency only that a law firm was reviewing " all relevant aspects of the matter . "
kfw suspended two of its seven-member executive board , detlef leinberger and peter fleischer .
they remain on full pay , focus said .
kfw said its exposure to the lehman failure totalled 536 million euros .
another german state bank , bayern lb , reportedly has exposure of 300 million euros -lrb- $ 432 million -rrb- , while a newspaper , koelner stadt-anzeiger , said saturday a third bank , nrw bank , was owed 60 million euros by lehman . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .
short sales have been banned in britain until january 16 and in the united states until october 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his action sparked the protestant reformation .
wittenberg , a city of some 47,000 souls on the elbe river between berlin and leipzig , launches the luther decade this weekend in the run-up to the reformation 's 500th anniversary .
the celebrations begin the dramatic opening is set for saturday , sept .

the festivities will then move into the city , where the locals and many guests will celebrate the famous theologian .
a special church service is planned for sunday .
lectures , exhibitions , festivals and concerts will be held at various places in the coming years up to 2017 , the anniversary of luther 's posting of his theses .
" we 're expecting a few thousand people from all over the world at the weekend , " said johannes winkelmann , director of the cultural society wittenbergkultur .

the venue is the lutherhaus , the house where luther lived which is now a museum on the reformation .

on friday , ralf grabsch , a tour de france participant who was born near wittenberg , and two other cyclists plan to set off for wittenberg from st augustine 's monastery in erfurt .
luther joined the augustinian monastery in 1505 after having been nearly struck dead by lightning .
he took his monastic vows in 1506 and began studying theology in erfurt in 1507 .
plenty of wine and music will also help mark the passing of half a millennium since luther 's arrival in wittenberg .
a " monastery fete " is scheduled saturday in the courtyard of the lutherhaus .
visitors can have guided tours of the house and seminary .
luther town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wittenberg market place will be abuzz with visitors come luther decade the lutherhaus is on unesco 's world heritage list , along with the local church , the schlosskirche , and the house of philipp melanchthon , luther 's friend and fellow protestant reformer .
wittenberg 's chief industry is luther-oriented tourism - the city draws about 400,000 visitors each year - which it aims to boost during the luther decade .
among the special events planned for next year is a conference on a commemoration of the reformation in east and west germany , a play called luther / chess , and regular orations in the local church on the theme of the seven days of creation . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .
short sales have been banned in britain until january 16 and in the united states until october 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

his action sparked the protestant reformation .
wittenberg , a city of some 47,000 souls on the elbe river between berlin and leipzig , launches the luther decade this weekend in the run-up to the reformation 's 500th anniversary .

on friday , ralf grabsch , a tour de france participant who was born near wittenberg , and two other cyclists plan to set off for wittenberg from st augustine 's monastery in erfurt .
luther joined the augustinian monastery in 1505 after having been nearly struck dead by lightning .
he took his monastic vows in 1506 and began studying theology in erfurt in 1507 .
plenty of wine and music will also help mark the passing of half a millennium since luther 's arrival in wittenberg .
a " monastery fete " is scheduled saturday in the courtyard of the lutherhaus .

wittenberg 's chief industry is luther-oriented tourism - the city draws about 400,000 visitors each year - which it aims to boost during the luther decade .
among the special events planned for next year is a conference on a commemoration of the reformation in east and west germany , a play called luther / chess , and regular orations in the local church on the theme of the seven days of creation . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .
short sales have been banned in britain until january 16 and in the united states until october 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .
volkswagen shares traded at 262 euros friday afternoon , down 14 per cent after surging 27 per cent thursday amid a so-far unexplained rash of buying .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

the venue is the lutherhaus , the house where luther lived which is now a museum on the reformation .

on friday , ralf grabsch , a tour de france participant who was born near wittenberg , and two other cyclists plan to set off for wittenberg from st augustine 's monastery in erfurt .
luther joined the augustinian monastery in 1505 after having been nearly struck dead by lightning .
he took his monastic vows in 1506 and began studying theology in erfurt in 1507 .
plenty of wine and music will also help mark the passing of half a millennium since luther 's arrival in wittenberg .
a " monastery fete " is scheduled saturday in the courtyard of the lutherhaus .
visitors can have guided tours of the house and seminary .
luther town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wittenberg market place will be abuzz with visitors come luther decade the lutherhaus is on unesco 's world heritage list , along with the local church , the schlosskirche , and the house of philipp melanchthon , luther 's friend and fellow protestant reformer .
wittenberg 's chief industry is luther-oriented tourism - the city draws about 400,000 visitors each year - which it aims to boost during the luther decade .
among the special events planned for next year is a conference on a commemoration of the reformation in east and west germany , a play called luther / chess , and regular orations in the local church on the theme of the seven days of creation . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former bremen player tim borowski then got the consolation goals .
munich lost their first competitive game under new coach juergen klinsmann as captain mark van bommel lamented that " things like that can not happen . " tim borowski spoke of a " lethargic " performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen celebrating after routing the bundesliga champions werder bremen were jubiliant .
" we are all very proud and happy to have won .
we were more aggressive and made the most of our chances , " said werder bremen 's ozil .
nervous bayern defense crumbles schalke 04 defeated 10-man eintracht frankfurt 1-0 to move back to the top of the standings at least until sunday .
schalke have 11 points , sv hamburg take 10 into sunday 's match at vfl wolfsburg , bayer leverkusen have nine points , with bremen , munich , hertha berlin and borussia dortmund on eight points each .
judging by the season so far , the unbeaten champions munich were favoured over the runner-ups bremen , especially looking at the midweek champions league results with munich winning 1-0 at steaua bucharest while bremen were held 0-0 by famagusta .
but bremen dominated from the outset against a nervous munich defense and were awarded for their courage with a big win .
rosenberg broke the deadlock after half an hour , taking up a defense-splitting pass from ozil and slotting a low shot past michael rensing .
bremen doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime when naldo tapped home after ozil 's freekick and ozil ended any munich comeback hopes when he fired high into the net nine minutes into the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , tries to stop bremen 's markus rosenberg pizarro and rosenberg again , after rensing missed a free kick , made it 5-0 as memories returned of munich 's biggest bundesliga home loss , 7-0 against schalke in october 1976 .
borowski spared munich from total disaster with his late goals , but admitted swiftly afterwards : " this was a disastrous showing , we must apologize to the fans . "
hertha , schalke notch wins schalke were in full command against lowly frankfurt but did not break the deadlock until chris was sent off in the 34th for elbowing heiko westermann .
newly-hired jefferson farfan got the winner seven minutes later but schalke failed to impress .
elsewhere , hertha berlin won 1-0 at borussia moenchengladbach from gojko kacar 's first half strike , with the home side 's oliver neuville denied by the post twice .
arminia bielefeld defeated cologne 2-0 .
energie cottbus got the first goal of the season , from dennis sorensen , but were held 1-1 by vfl bochum to remain at the bottom of the table .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

" this is a reminder of the threat we all face .

he said the death toll could rise drastically as many of the injured are in critical condition . the luxury hotel is located in a high security zone , about 500 meters from the residencies of pakistan 's prime minister and president . attack coincides with calls to stamp out terrorism the blast created panic at the prime minister 's house where premier yousaf raza gilani was hosting a dinner to break the ramadan fast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack came hours after zardari vowed to stamp out terrorism during a speech in parliament president asif ali zardari and military chief ishfaq parvez kayani were also among the guests , pakistan 's dawnnews reported . no one has claimed responsibility for the blast , but taliban militants with their bases in country 's tribal areas along afghan border have carried out a series of suicide bombings across pakistan over the last 18 months . the blast came on the same day when the new president asif ali zardari , widower of assassinated former pakistani leader benazir bhutto , vowed before parliament to " root out terrorism and extremism .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .
short sales have been banned in britain until january 16 and in the united states until october 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .
short sales have been banned in britain until january 16 and in the united states until october 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- .

" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .

the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .

short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .

" today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .

the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .

" we have no complete picture yet and continue to be in close contact with the pakistani authorities , " she said . the british foreign office said four british citizens were injured in the bombing while denmark confirmed that a danish diplomat was among the injured . a statement from the eu presidency , currently held by france , said the eu will " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the us too expressed support for the country 's government . " the united states strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took place in islamabad , pakistan , today , " national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said in a statement .
" this is a reminder of the threat we all face .
the united states will stand with pakistan 's democratically elected government as they confront this challenge , " he said . saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . british foreign secretary david miliband said saturday the bombing of the hotel was a " disgraceful " attack which reinforces britain 's resolve to fight violent extremism with pakistan . " this latest bombing attack in islamabad is yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification , " miliband said . official says death toll could rise four of the five stories of the hotel caught fire after the blast , which was so huge that it was heard kilometers away .
people were trapped in the gutted building and fire brigade vehicles were trying to extinguish the blaze . " i saw a vehicle approaching the main entrance of the hotel and then it blew up , " an injured witness , mukhtar ahmad , told german news agency dpa before he was taken to hospital by ambulance . a security official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the deadly vehicle was a truck loaded with around half a ton of explosives . islamabad police chief asghar raza gardezi confirmed that 50 people were killed and more than 200 injured .
he said the death toll could rise drastically as many of the injured are in critical condition . the luxury hotel is located in a high security zone , about 500 meters from the residencies of pakistan 's prime minister and president . attack coincides with calls to stamp out terrorism the blast created panic at the prime minister 's house where premier yousaf raza gilani was hosting a dinner to break the ramadan fast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack came hours after zardari vowed to stamp out terrorism during a speech in parliament president asif ali zardari and military chief ishfaq parvez kayani were also among the guests , pakistan 's dawnnews reported . no one has claimed responsibility for the blast , but taliban militants with their bases in country 's tribal areas along afghan border have carried out a series of suicide bombings across pakistan over the last 18 months . the blast came on the same day when the new president asif ali zardari , widower of assassinated former pakistani leader benazir bhutto , vowed before parliament to " root out terrorism and extremism .

20 . kfw , a government bank that administers federal shareholdings and passes out soft loans to home-owners , was dubbed " germany 's dumbest bank " by the mass-circulation newspaper bild when the scandal broke .
the automated payment on monday went out just hours before lehman declared itself insolvent .
lehman did not settle the swap with the equivalent in us currency , 500 million dollars , leaving kfw in the queue as a creditor .
quoting banking sources , the german weekly magazine focus said kfw had asked a frankfurt law firm , clifford , to study if it could sack or bring a prosecution against executives responsible for the blunder .
asked to confirm the story , a kfw spokeswoman told the dpa news agency only that a law firm was reviewing " all relevant aspects of the matter . "
kfw suspended two of its seven-member executive board , detlef leinberger and peter fleischer .
they remain on full pay , focus said .
kfw said its exposure to the lehman failure totalled 536 million euros .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .
volkswagen shares traded at 262 euros friday afternoon , down 14 per cent after surging 27 per cent thursday amid a so-far unexplained rash of buying .

" we have no complete picture yet and continue to be in close contact with the pakistani authorities , " she said . the british foreign office said four british citizens were injured in the bombing while denmark confirmed that a danish diplomat was among the injured . a statement from the eu presidency , currently held by france , said the eu will " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the us too expressed support for the country 's government . " the united states strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took place in islamabad , pakistan , today , " national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said in a statement .
" this is a reminder of the threat we all face .
the united states will stand with pakistan 's democratically elected government as they confront this challenge , " he said . saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . british foreign secretary david miliband said saturday the bombing of the hotel was a " disgraceful " attack which reinforces britain 's resolve to fight violent extremism with pakistan . " this latest bombing attack in islamabad is yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification , " miliband said . official says death toll could rise four of the five stories of the hotel caught fire after the blast , which was so huge that it was heard kilometers away .
people were trapped in the gutted building and fire brigade vehicles were trying to extinguish the blaze . " i saw a vehicle approaching the main entrance of the hotel and then it blew up , " an injured witness , mukhtar ahmad , told german news agency dpa before he was taken to hospital by ambulance . a security official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the deadly vehicle was a truck loaded with around half a ton of explosives . islamabad police chief asghar raza gardezi confirmed that 50 people were killed and more than 200 injured .
he said the death toll could rise drastically as many of the injured are in critical condition . the luxury hotel is located in a high security zone , about 500 meters from the residencies of pakistan 's prime minister and president . attack coincides with calls to stamp out terrorism the blast created panic at the prime minister 's house where premier yousaf raza gilani was hosting a dinner to break the ramadan fast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack came hours after zardari vowed to stamp out terrorism during a speech in parliament president asif ali zardari and military chief ishfaq parvez kayani were also among the guests , pakistan 's dawnnews reported . no one has claimed responsibility for the blast , but taliban militants with their bases in country 's tribal areas along afghan border have carried out a series of suicide bombings across pakistan over the last 18 months . the blast came on the same day when the new president asif ali zardari , widower of assassinated former pakistani leader benazir bhutto , vowed before parliament to " root out terrorism and extremism .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .
volkswagen shares traded at 262 euros friday afternoon , down 14 per cent after surging 27 per cent thursday amid a so-far unexplained rash of buying .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .
volkswagen shares traded at 262 euros friday afternoon , down 14 per cent after surging 27 per cent thursday amid a so-far unexplained rash of buying .
both porsche and lower saxony denied they were the buyers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims . "
the german interior ministry spoke out friday against the rally , saying the planned gathering of " populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and muslim citizens have striven for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators set fire to trash cans during clashes with police the mosque , close to a soaring telecommunications tower in a district on the edge of town , is to have a dome 37 meters high and two minarets stretching up 55 meters .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .
volkswagen shares traded at 262 euros friday afternoon , down 14 per cent after surging 27 per cent thursday amid a so-far unexplained rash of buying .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .

its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .
" it 's a victory for the city of cologne and a victory by the democratic forces in this city , " he told dpa news agency . armin laschet , minister for minorities in north rhine-westphalia state , went further , telling the tagesspiegel newspaper it was the first time an entire german city " stood up to protect its muslims .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .
volkswagen shares traded at 262 euros friday afternoon , down 14 per cent after surging 27 per cent thursday amid a so-far unexplained rash of buying .

nervous bayern defense crumbles schalke 04 defeated 10-man eintracht frankfurt 1-0 to move back to the top of the standings at least until sunday .
schalke have 11 points , sv hamburg take 10 into sunday 's match at vfl wolfsburg , bayer leverkusen have nine points , with bremen , munich , hertha berlin and borussia dortmund on eight points each .
judging by the season so far , the unbeaten champions munich were favoured over the runner-ups bremen , especially looking at the midweek champions league results with munich winning 1-0 at steaua bucharest while bremen were held 0-0 by famagusta .
but bremen dominated from the outset against a nervous munich defense and were awarded for their courage with a big win .
rosenberg broke the deadlock after half an hour , taking up a defense-splitting pass from ozil and slotting a low shot past michael rensing .
bremen doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime when naldo tapped home after ozil 's freekick and ozil ended any munich comeback hopes when he fired high into the net nine minutes into the second half .

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said .

" it was said for a long time ' let the markets take care of themselves ' and that there is ' no need for more transparency ' , " merkel said at a rally in linz , where she was campaigning on behalf of the austrian conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- . " today we are a step further because even america and britain are saying ' yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards for the ratings agencies ' , " merkel said . merkel : not enough support from us , britain in a seperate interview with a munich newspaper , muenchner merkur , to be published on monday , merkel criticized the us and british governments for obstructing germany 's efforts in the first half of 2007 to bring greater transparency to the markets .
" i criticise the perception that the financial markets have of themselves , " she told the paper . " alas , they have opposed for too long the introduction of rules with the backing of the british and american governments , " she said . " on top of national rules , we need more international agreements to stem irresponsible financial speculation . " merkel said that when germany headed the g8 group of industrialized nations last year , it had advocated greater transparency in international financial transactions , especially in hedge funds . she said a single nation like germany could do little by itself to fix the international financial system .
" that 's why i and finance minister -lrb- peer -rrb- steinbrueck insisted back in 2007 during the german presidency of the group of eight that we need more rules for greater transparency in international money dealing , with the ratings agencies and with the hedge funds , " she said .
but the united states and britain " did not back this to the degree required , " she said .
" that was regretable at first but that 's changed in the meantime , " the chancellor added . germany freezes short-selling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and britain have already banned the practice meanwhile , germany halted short-selling in financial shares , when investors borrow company stock to sell it , following the example of britain and the united states .
the ban affects 11 shares including those of aareal bank , allianz , amb generali , commerzbank , deutsche bank , deutsche boerse , deutsche postbank , hannover re , hypo real estate , mlp and munich re .
the federal financial supervisory authority , or bafin , said short sales were banned with immediate effect until the end of the year , underscoring that they could lead to huge losses in the current global financial turmoil .
" in the prevailing situation in the markets , these could lead to losses for financial institutions , " bafin chief jochen sanio said .
however , the ban will be reviewed routinely , bafin said .
short-selling can put enormous pressure on markets if sentiment turns negative - as it has done over past months in the credit crunch - and is considered partly responsible for the dramatic fall in share prices seen in once mighty investment banks and other financial groups .
short sales are designed to profit from a declining share price by an investor or broker arranging a sale of a share he does not own but has " borrowed " on an agreement to return the share at a future date .
in effect , the investor or broker is betting that the share price will fall and that they will make a profit .
short sales have been banned in britain until january 16 and in the united states until october 2 . dw staff -lrb- nda / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his action sparked the protestant reformation .
wittenberg , a city of some 47,000 souls on the elbe river between berlin and leipzig , launches the luther decade this weekend in the run-up to the reformation 's 500th anniversary .
the celebrations begin the dramatic opening is set for saturday , sept .
20 , with a reenactment of luther 's arrival on the banks of the elbe .
the festivities will then move into the city , where the locals and many guests will celebrate the famous theologian .
a special church service is planned for sunday .
lectures , exhibitions , festivals and concerts will be held at various places in the coming years up to 2017 , the anniversary of luther 's posting of his theses .
" we 're expecting a few thousand people from all over the world at the weekend , " said johannes winkelmann , director of the cultural society wittenbergkultur .
the guests will include numerous prominent theologians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle church in wittenberg will play a special part in luther decade celebrations mark hanson , president of the lutheran world federation and a resident of chicago , will give the sermon at sunday 's special church service - in the schlosskirche , naturally .
before that , however , wittenberg theologian friedrich schorlemmer and christopf stoelzl , previously berlin 's top cultural official , will engage in a disputation titled " jesus was revolutionary ; the church became conservative . "
the venue is the lutherhaus , the house where luther lived which is now a museum on the reformation .
a cycling trio will help kick off the luther decade by retracing luther 's path .
on friday , ralf grabsch , a tour de france participant who was born near wittenberg , and two other cyclists plan to set off for wittenberg from st augustine 's monastery in erfurt .
luther joined the augustinian monastery in 1505 after having been nearly struck dead by lightning .
he took his monastic vows in 1506 and began studying theology in erfurt in 1507 .
plenty of wine and music will also help mark the passing of half a millennium since luther 's arrival in wittenberg .
a " monastery fete " is scheduled saturday in the courtyard of the lutherhaus .
visitors can have guided tours of the house and seminary .
luther town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wittenberg market place will be abuzz with visitors come luther decade the lutherhaus is on unesco 's world heritage list , along with the local church , the schlosskirche , and the house of philipp melanchthon , luther 's friend and fellow protestant reformer .
wittenberg 's chief industry is luther-oriented tourism - the city draws about 400,000 visitors each year - which it aims to boost during the luther decade .
among the special events planned for next year is a conference on a commemoration of the reformation in east and west germany , a play called luther / chess , and regular orations in the local church on the theme of the seven days of creation . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former bremen player tim borowski then got the consolation goals .
munich lost their first competitive game under new coach juergen klinsmann as captain mark van bommel lamented that " things like that can not happen . " tim borowski spoke of a " lethargic " performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen celebrating after routing the bundesliga champions werder bremen were jubiliant .
" we are all very proud and happy to have won .
we were more aggressive and made the most of our chances , " said werder bremen 's ozil .
nervous bayern defense crumbles schalke 04 defeated 10-man eintracht frankfurt 1-0 to move back to the top of the standings at least until sunday .
schalke have 11 points , sv hamburg take 10 into sunday 's match at vfl wolfsburg , bayer leverkusen have nine points , with bremen , munich , hertha berlin and borussia dortmund on eight points each .
judging by the season so far , the unbeaten champions munich were favoured over the runner-ups bremen , especially looking at the midweek champions league results with munich winning 1-0 at steaua bucharest while bremen were held 0-0 by famagusta .
but bremen dominated from the outset against a nervous munich defense and were awarded for their courage with a big win .
rosenberg broke the deadlock after half an hour , taking up a defense-splitting pass from ozil and slotting a low shot past michael rensing .
bremen doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime when naldo tapped home after ozil 's freekick and ozil ended any munich comeback hopes when he fired high into the net nine minutes into the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , tries to stop bremen 's markus rosenberg pizarro and rosenberg again , after rensing missed a free kick , made it 5-0 as memories returned of munich 's biggest bundesliga home loss , 7-0 against schalke in october 1976 .
borowski spared munich from total disaster with his late goals , but admitted swiftly afterwards : " this was a disastrous showing , we must apologize to the fans . "
hertha , schalke notch wins schalke were in full command against lowly frankfurt but did not break the deadlock until chris was sent off in the 34th for elbowing heiko westermann .
newly-hired jefferson farfan got the winner seven minutes later but schalke failed to impress .
elsewhere , hertha berlin won 1-0 at borussia moenchengladbach from gojko kacar 's first half strike , with the home side 's oliver neuville denied by the post twice .
arminia bielefeld defeated cologne 2-0 .
energie cottbus got the first goal of the season , from dennis sorensen , but were held 1-1 by vfl bochum to remain at the bottom of the table .

former bremen player tim borowski then got the consolation goals .
munich lost their first competitive game under new coach juergen klinsmann as captain mark van bommel lamented that " things like that can not happen . " tim borowski spoke of a " lethargic " performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen celebrating after routing the bundesliga champions werder bremen were jubiliant .
" we are all very proud and happy to have won .
we were more aggressive and made the most of our chances , " said werder bremen 's ozil .
nervous bayern defense crumbles schalke 04 defeated 10-man eintracht frankfurt 1-0 to move back to the top of the standings at least until sunday .
schalke have 11 points , sv hamburg take 10 into sunday 's match at vfl wolfsburg , bayer leverkusen have nine points , with bremen , munich , hertha berlin and borussia dortmund on eight points each .
judging by the season so far , the unbeaten champions munich were favoured over the runner-ups bremen , especially looking at the midweek champions league results with munich winning 1-0 at steaua bucharest while bremen were held 0-0 by famagusta .
but bremen dominated from the outset against a nervous munich defense and were awarded for their courage with a big win .
rosenberg broke the deadlock after half an hour , taking up a defense-splitting pass from ozil and slotting a low shot past michael rensing .
bremen doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime when naldo tapped home after ozil 's freekick and ozil ended any munich comeback hopes when he fired high into the net nine minutes into the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , tries to stop bremen 's markus rosenberg pizarro and rosenberg again , after rensing missed a free kick , made it 5-0 as memories returned of munich 's biggest bundesliga home loss , 7-0 against schalke in october 1976 .
borowski spared munich from total disaster with his late goals , but admitted swiftly afterwards : " this was a disastrous showing , we must apologize to the fans . "
hertha , schalke notch wins schalke were in full command against lowly frankfurt but did not break the deadlock until chris was sent off in the 34th for elbowing heiko westermann .
newly-hired jefferson farfan got the winner seven minutes later but schalke failed to impress .
elsewhere , hertha berlin won 1-0 at borussia moenchengladbach from gojko kacar 's first half strike , with the home side 's oliver neuville denied by the post twice .
arminia bielefeld defeated cologne 2-0 .
energie cottbus got the first goal of the season , from dennis sorensen , but were held 1-1 by vfl bochum to remain at the bottom of the table .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .
rightist group formed to oppose " islamification " of cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the small group of nationalists who turned up for the event were turned away pro cologne , a local group which won 5 per cent of votes at the last city-council elections , said saturday it was outraged by the decision to cancel the congress .
its secretary , markus wiener , said , " it 's typical of the cologne police leadership that they ca n't enforce freedom of assembly and that they cave in to street terrorism . "
wiener said his group had had 1,000 supporters trying to attend the rally .
a city councillor for the group said he would challenge the ban in court .
" we 'll repeat the event later , " manfred rouhs told wdr television .
police had banned pro cologne from marching friday evening to multi-ethnic neighborhoods , saying that riot police would not be able to keep order .
there was no sign in the city of prominent far-rightists from abroad who had been invited , such as jean-marie le pen , the founder of the national front in france .
" a victory for democracy " cologne mayor schramma , who has personally backed the mosque project , welcomed the rally ban .

" we have no complete picture yet and continue to be in close contact with the pakistani authorities , " she said . the british foreign office said four british citizens were injured in the bombing while denmark confirmed that a danish diplomat was among the injured . a statement from the eu presidency , currently held by france , said the eu will " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the us too expressed support for the country 's government . " the united states strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took place in islamabad , pakistan , today , " national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said in a statement .
" this is a reminder of the threat we all face .
the united states will stand with pakistan 's democratically elected government as they confront this challenge , " he said . saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . british foreign secretary david miliband said saturday the bombing of the hotel was a " disgraceful " attack which reinforces britain 's resolve to fight violent extremism with pakistan . " this latest bombing attack in islamabad is yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification , " miliband said . official says death toll could rise four of the five stories of the hotel caught fire after the blast , which was so huge that it was heard kilometers away .
people were trapped in the gutted building and fire brigade vehicles were trying to extinguish the blaze . " i saw a vehicle approaching the main entrance of the hotel and then it blew up , " an injured witness , mukhtar ahmad , told german news agency dpa before he was taken to hospital by ambulance . a security official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the deadly vehicle was a truck loaded with around half a ton of explosives . islamabad police chief asghar raza gardezi confirmed that 50 people were killed and more than 200 injured .
he said the death toll could rise drastically as many of the injured are in critical condition . the luxury hotel is located in a high security zone , about 500 meters from the residencies of pakistan 's prime minister and president . attack coincides with calls to stamp out terrorism the blast created panic at the prime minister 's house where premier yousaf raza gilani was hosting a dinner to break the ramadan fast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack came hours after zardari vowed to stamp out terrorism during a speech in parliament president asif ali zardari and military chief ishfaq parvez kayani were also among the guests , pakistan 's dawnnews reported . no one has claimed responsibility for the blast , but taliban militants with their bases in country 's tribal areas along afghan border have carried out a series of suicide bombings across pakistan over the last 18 months . the blast came on the same day when the new president asif ali zardari , widower of assassinated former pakistani leader benazir bhutto , vowed before parliament to " root out terrorism and extremism .

" we have no complete picture yet and continue to be in close contact with the pakistani authorities , " she said . the british foreign office said four british citizens were injured in the bombing while denmark confirmed that a danish diplomat was among the injured . a statement from the eu presidency , currently held by france , said the eu will " more than ever stand side by side " with pakistan in its struggle against terrorism . the us too expressed support for the country 's government . " the united states strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took place in islamabad , pakistan , today , " national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said in a statement .
" this is a reminder of the threat we all face .
the united states will stand with pakistan 's democratically elected government as they confront this challenge , " he said . saturday 's attack was the worst in the capital , and came six months after a civilian government took power , and a month after it forced former army chief and staunch us ally pervez musharraf to step down as president . british foreign secretary david miliband said saturday the bombing of the hotel was a " disgraceful " attack which reinforces britain 's resolve to fight violent extremism with pakistan .

he said the death toll could rise drastically as many of the injured are in critical condition . the luxury hotel is located in a high security zone , about 500 meters from the residencies of pakistan 's prime minister and president . attack coincides with calls to stamp out terrorism the blast created panic at the prime minister 's house where premier yousaf raza gilani was hosting a dinner to break the ramadan fast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack came hours after zardari vowed to stamp out terrorism during a speech in parliament president asif ali zardari and military chief ishfaq parvez kayani were also among the guests , pakistan 's dawnnews reported . no one has claimed responsibility for the blast , but taliban militants with their bases in country 's tribal areas along afghan border have carried out a series of suicide bombings across pakistan over the last 18 months . the blast came on the same day when the new president asif ali zardari , widower of assassinated former pakistani leader benazir bhutto , vowed before parliament to " root out terrorism and extremism .

radical leftists also fought riot police on the streets . a far-right group pro-cologne had called the rally to oppose a decision by local authorities in cologne to allow the construction of a mosque with a high dome and minarets .
it invited nationalist groups from around europe to join the " stop islam " rally to fight what it called the " islamisation and immigration invasion " of germany and europe .
but only 50 supporters of the anti-immigrant group pro cologne managed to reach a city square for the scheduled rally against plans to construct a grand mosque in the german city .
an anti-right sit-down by 5,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators had blocked every entrance to the square .
at the same time , police were fighting pitched battles with extreme leftists who tried to occupy the square .
the " stop islam " rally did start briefly , with more reporters than rightists attending but then city police declared the event illegal on public-safety grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing protesters dressed as clowns faced off against police on saturday " the rally has been cancelled , " a police spokesman said .
the announcement sparked cheers from many protesters . " the safety of our cologne people has priority , " said a police spokesman after ugly clashes between far-leftists and riot police .
the leftists , who were bent on occupying a city square set aside for the rightists to use , assaulted police and tried to snatch their pistols .
riot police advanced against them , swinging batons .
at heumarkt , the square set aside for the rightists , the far left attacked roadblocks at several places and scuffled with riot police , but were repulsed .
" we had to crack down hard to avoid something worse happening , " a police spokesman said .
reporters saw two men being detained .
a police officer was hurt in the face when a firecracker was thrown at him .
expecting trouble , riot police kept water-cannon trucks that can knock a man to the ground at 30 meters at the ready .
a police spokesman said the leftists were no longer attacking in small groups but in large formations .
television images showed that only about 50 rightists managed to pass the blockade and enter the city square , where " no mosque " banners were hanging .
rally inflames passions in muslim nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mayor schramma vocally opposed the far-rightists about a kilometer away , several thousand peaceful demonstrators listened as cologne 's mayor fritz schramma stood up outside the city 's great cathedral to denounce the far-right rally .
city and national german authorities detest the rightists , but say they must allow them the right of free speech .
schramma described those who bent on holding the far-right rally as " racists in bourgeois dress " and " the moldy clique of euro-fascism , " adding : " i say , there is the door .
go home ! "
the planned anti-mosque demonstration had not only inflamed passions in germany , but in muslim nations .
iran demanded that germany prohibit it .
but german police and lawyers said it could not be banned purely because of the opinions to be expressed .
the mayhem also hit rail links .
a signal box on the edge of town was set on fire in the early morning by persons unknown , forcing the closure of a main line for several hours and the diversion of 12 national express trains .
the line was re-opened after hasty repairs .

only the state of baden-wuerttemberg , home of luxury carmaker porsche , has spoken up in favor of the eu .
but on friday it quietly dropped a challenge in the bundesrat upper chamber to the german legislation .
the merkel government has drafted a reform of the legislation on volkswagen which it believes satisfies eu law while cementing the veto powers asserted by lower saxony with just over 20 per cent of vw shares .
the two states squabbled friday in the bundesrat , but the chamber then voted its blessing to the merkel government 's reform law , which will be debated next in parliament 's lower chamber .
" german company law is no business of the eu , " said lower saxony state premier christian wulff in the debate .
merkel spokesman thomas steg said she would defend the veto law to the european commission , which has threatened to fine germany if it does not repeal the law .
porsche opposes the law and is seeking to cut down the influence of lower saxony and volkswagen unions .
it said friday it would next week be asking volkswagen for financial data , so that porsche could begin compiling consolidated accounts treating volkswagen as a subsidiary .
porsche proclaimed this week its effective majority control of its larger competitor with 35 per cent of the shares , enough to dominate shareholder meetings where fewer than 70 per cent of shares are ever represented .
volkswagen shares traded at 262 euros friday afternoon , down 14 per cent after surging 27 per cent thursday amid a so-far unexplained rash of buying .

former bremen player tim borowski then got the consolation goals .
munich lost their first competitive game under new coach juergen klinsmann as captain mark van bommel lamented that " things like that can not happen . " tim borowski spoke of a " lethargic " performance .

nervous bayern defense crumbles schalke 04 defeated 10-man eintracht frankfurt 1-0 to move back to the top of the standings at least until sunday .
schalke have 11 points , sv hamburg take 10 into sunday 's match at vfl wolfsburg , bayer leverkusen have nine points , with bremen , munich , hertha berlin and borussia dortmund on eight points each .
judging by the season so far , the unbeaten champions munich were favoured over the runner-ups bremen , especially looking at the midweek champions league results with munich winning 1-0 at steaua bucharest while bremen were held 0-0 by famagusta .
but bremen dominated from the outset against a nervous munich defense and were awarded for their courage with a big win .
rosenberg broke the deadlock after half an hour , taking up a defense-splitting pass from ozil and slotting a low shot past michael rensing .
bremen doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime when naldo tapped home after ozil 's freekick and ozil ended any munich comeback hopes when he fired high into the net nine minutes into the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , tries to stop bremen 's markus rosenberg pizarro and rosenberg again , after rensing missed a free kick , made it 5-0 as memories returned of munich 's biggest bundesliga home loss , 7-0 against schalke in october 1976 .
borowski spared munich from total disaster with his late goals , but admitted swiftly afterwards : " this was a disastrous showing , we must apologize to the fans . "
hertha , schalke notch wins schalke were in full command against lowly frankfurt but did not break the deadlock until chris was sent off in the 34th for elbowing heiko westermann .
newly-hired jefferson farfan got the winner seven minutes later but schalke failed to impress .

" this latest bombing attack in islamabad is yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification , " miliband said . official says death toll could rise four of the five stories of the hotel caught fire after the blast , which was so huge that it was heard kilometers away .

media requires javascript to play .
president bush on ' ' a pivotal moment " in the us economy the us is set to take " unprecedented measures " to tackle the crisis gripping us financial markets , president george w bush has said .
the treasury is proposing a fund worth up to $ 800bn to buy back a large proportion of the us mortgage market , media reports say .
legislation for the plan will be pushed through as soon as possible , treasury secretary henry paulson said .
the us took action after a week of turmoil on global money markets .
the new york times says the new fund will be used only to buy assets from us financial institutions , not from individuals .
the plan would not be managed by a new government agency but instead by investment managers specially hired by the treasury .
stock markets around the world have endured a roller-coaster week as traders and investors fretted about the fall-out from the current credit crisis : central banks around the world pumping billions of dollars of extra funding into money markets on thursday and friday to ease the liquidity crisis the us announcing further measures to shore up the markets , including a ban on short-selling and guarantees to temporarily insure money market deposits stock markets around the world rallying after a dire week on news of the us rescue plans - with the uk 's ftse 100 closing with its biggest one-day gain stock markets in russia temporarily suspended again on friday at the end of a week of wild swings and stop-go trading banking group morgan stanley reportedly looking for a partner amid concerns about its future recovery plans president bush said swift , politically bipartisan action was needed to keep the us economy from grinding to a halt as problems sparked by the credit crisis had begun to spread through the entire financial system - leaving jobs , pensions and companies under threat .
" these are risks the us can not afford to take .
we must act now to protect economic health from serious risk , " he added .
the us is facing " unprecedented challenges and we 're responding with unprecedented action " , he said .
a " bold " move was needed to restore the financial system 's health , mr paulson insisted .
he added the bush administration was stepping in with a plan to remove so-called " toxic debts " from us banks ' balance sheets .
while he gave few details , he said federal lawmakers would meet over the weekend to thrash out legislation for the programme which must be " large enough to have maximum impact " .
the treasury and the fed have finally realised the depth and systemic nature of the crisis john ryding , economist who 's to blame for the crisis ?
shares surge on bail-out news will the plan work ?
in the meantime , he said that the government would be stepping up action to increase the availability of capital for new home loans .

stock markets around the world have endured a roller-coaster week as traders and investors fretted about the fall-out from the current credit crisis : central banks around the world pumping billions of dollars of extra funding into money markets on thursday and friday to ease the liquidity crisis the us announcing further measures to shore up the markets , including a ban on short-selling and guarantees to temporarily insure money market deposits stock markets around the world rallying after a dire week on news of the us rescue plans - with the uk 's ftse 100 closing with its biggest one-day gain stock markets in russia temporarily suspended again on friday at the end of a week of wild swings and stop-go trading banking group morgan stanley reportedly looking for a partner amid concerns about its future recovery plans president bush said swift , politically bipartisan action was needed to keep the us economy from grinding to a halt as problems sparked by the credit crisis had begun to spread through the entire financial system - leaving jobs , pensions and companies under threat .
" these are risks the us can not afford to take .
we must act now to protect economic health from serious risk , " he added .
the us is facing " unprecedented challenges and we 're responding with unprecedented action " , he said .
a " bold " move was needed to restore the financial system 's health , mr paulson insisted .
he added the bush administration was stepping in with a plan to remove so-called " toxic debts " from us banks ' balance sheets .
while he gave few details , he said federal lawmakers would meet over the weekend to thrash out legislation for the programme which must be " large enough to have maximum impact " . "
the treasury and the fed have finally realised the depth and systemic nature of the crisis " john ryding , economist who 's to blame for the crisis ?
shares surge on bail-out news will the plan work ?
in the meantime , he said that the government would be stepping up action to increase the availability of capital for new home loans .
once this difficult period was over , mr paulson said , the government 's next task would be to overhaul bank regulations .
the chairman of the senate banking committee , christopher dodd , said he and his colleagues would need to see the details of the plan first , but he accepted that quick action would be needed .
" we understand the gravity of the moment , " said the democratic senator .
rescue moves earlier on friday , the government announced plans to guarantee us money market funds - mutual funds that typically invest in low-risk credit such as government bonds and are often used by pension funds - up to a value of $ 50bn , in a move to further restore confidence . "
confidence is essential to the smooth operation of our economy " president bush robert peston on the rescue plan mccain attacks bank assistance meanwhile , the securities and exchange commission temporarily banned " short-selling " in the stocks of 799 companies .
short-selling is a form of trading which effectively bets that the value of a company 's shares will fall .
reaction to the announcements was swift on money markets across the world , with wall street closing in positive territory while the london market ended the session with its biggest one day gain .
" the treasury and the fed have finally realised the depth and systemic nature of the crisis , " said john ryding , an economist at rdq economics " we believe that these actions will constitute the wider firebreak that will contain the crisis . "
criticism however , the proposals did draw criticism from republican presidential nominee john mccain .
" the federal reserve should get back to its core business of responsibly managing our money supply and inflation , " he told reporters .
meanwhile , democratic rival barack obama gave his backing to plans to give the treasury department " broad authority " to deal with the crisis .
according to president bush action will restore confidence to the us system , and " confidence is essential to the smooth operation of our economy " .
mounting fears that the credit crisis is beginning to spread out through the financial system have rocked shares and companies recently .
investment giant lehman brothers collapsed this week , rival merrill lynch was bought out by bank of america , and the us government has bailed out insurer aig with an $ 85bn rescue package and state-backed mortgage lenders fannie mae and freddie mac .

some $ 700m -lrb- £ 382m -rrb- in emergency aid is needed to prevent the region descending into full-scale famine , it said .
top un humanitarian official john holmes said food stocks were critically low in parts of ethiopia , somalia , eritrea , northern kenya and uganda .

but where does this very distinct , vivid image come from ?
it 's certainly very different from the merlin depicted in the new bbc drama series beginning on saturday , which will tell a family-friendly story of the wizard in his formative years .
but the " reality " of the character through the ages is actually quite diverse .
in the tv documentary merlin - the legend , which also screens on the bbc on saturday , historians and experts discuss his origins , his influence through the ages and his supposed welsh links .
it was the little-known clergyman geoffrey of monmouth who first wrote about merlin in the 12th century in his book the history of the kings of briton .
according to dr juliette wood from cardiff university , the merlin who appeared in his writing was not a real person , but a figment of geoffrey of monmouth 's imagination .
merlin on film excalibur -lrb- 1981 -rrb- directed by john boorman , this account of the arthurian legend starred nicol williamson as merlin monty python and the holy grail -lrb- 1975 -rrb- the monty python take on the king arthur legends , starring john cleese as an explosion-happy tim the enchanter the sword in the stone -lrb- 1963 -rrb- disney does merlin with karl swenson providing the voice for the bearded one king arthur -lrb- 2004 -rrb- stephen dillane is merlin in a demystified take on the knights of the round table a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court -lrb- 1949 -rrb- strangely , a singing mechanic from 1912 finds himself in camelot , with murvyn vye as a villainous merlin " geoffrey 's purpose was to create a myth for the new anglo-norman aristocracy because they had left france and they had to justify who they were and why they were conquering this new country , " she tells merlin - the legend .
" in order to do this he draws on welsh tradition and he creates this powerful magician figure who becomes the person who organises the birth of arthur and looks after king arthur .
" merlin is a fusion of two characters .
one is wonder child ambrosius , the other is the bard merddyn wilt and geoffrey simply says that there was a character called merlinus ambrosius and suddenly we have merlin . "
according to dr wood , geoffrey not only connected merlin with the origins of the country in his book but also with stonehenge telling stories which manipulated his audience into believing he had magical powers without ever stating categorically that he did .
merlin is also a re-appearing figure in the famous black book of carmarthen , which was written 750 years ago .
maredudd ap huw from the national library of wales said that here he was depicted as a very sorry , tragic character .
" he has obviously had some bad experiences in a battle , " he explained .
" he has become a figure who is living wild outside the boundaries of society .
" and from the hardship that he had suffered out came this wisdom that was respected by other people and held in high esteem . "
in other medieval texts , it seems merlin 's character becomes more established and art historian peter lord says the reappearing character of an old , bearded man in a long gown makes him seem like a " medieval hoody " .
geoffrey of monmouth has it of course that carmarthen was the birthplace of the wizard .
he supposedly lived in a cave on the hill overlooking the town and it is also thought the cave is his tomb .
a festival celebrating carmarthen 's links with arthurian legend has been running in the town since 2004 and people from all over the world make pilgrimages to the town .
during the time of the tudors , it is thought the character of merlin and king arthur were used to bring stability to the country after the wars of the roses .
this is demonstrated in thomas malory 's epic le morte d 'arthur .
here merlin is depicted as an advisor to his king and a stabilising influence from the old world in the tumultuous modern times .
in the 17th and 18th centuries , a growing interest in ancient britain led to merlin being depicted as a druid and bardic figure in both literature and art .
and in the 19th century , as the world went industrial , merlin was depicted more as a romantic figure .
he is overwhelmed by the seductive wiles of a woman in stories and art .
" it is perfect for the 19th century because of the strong gender polarities , " said dr wood .
merlin stories he was half-human , born of a mortal woman and an incubus , or evil spirit , from whom he inherits his natural powers he engineers arthur 's birth by enabling uther pendragon to enter into tintagel in cornwall in disguise and father arthur with his enemy 's wife igraine he created stonehenge as a great memorial for a general in ireland before transporting the whole thing to salisbury plain his downfall came when lusting after a woman called nimue , who coaxed out his magical secrets before using them against him to imprison him in a cave of glass " here is masculine , patriarchal merlin with all of its own certainties giving way to this very , very seductive , very attractive but slightly dangerous power of femininity . "
even nazi germany is said to have seized on merlin 's powerful image to create their own myths and national identity .
the head of the ss , heinrich himmler is believed to have seen himself as a merlin type figure who would advise the king - hitler .
their seizing of the arthurian legends led to friends and fantasy authors jrr tolkien and cs lewis drawing on the complex merlin associations to wage a literary war on the nazis .
but what about now ?
what relevance does the bearded 12th century wizard have on our technology-obsessed , disconnected and alienated society ?
according to dr wood , his influence is alive and well in everything from harry potter to new age spiritualism .
" you can find him in dumbledore and in harry potter himself .
through him children can do what they have always wanted to do which is become magicians themselves , " she said .
" people now are very interested in somehow getting into a spiritual nature and merlin has really become a shaman .
" this is something that reflects the earliest merlin , who was taken over by this kind of poetical ecstasy . "
whatever you take from the tales and depictions of merlin , he has certainly been a powerful and influential character since he was created around 800 years ago .
if only he was real ...

but where does this very distinct , vivid image come from ?
it 's certainly very different from the merlin depicted in the new bbc drama series beginning on saturday , which will tell a family-friendly story of the wizard in his formative years .
but the " reality " of the character through the ages is actually quite diverse .
in the tv documentary merlin - the legend , which also screens on the bbc on saturday , historians and experts discuss his origins , his influence through the ages and his supposed welsh links .
it was the little-known clergyman geoffrey of monmouth who first wrote about merlin in the 12th century in his book the history of the kings of briton .
according to dr juliette wood from cardiff university , the merlin who appeared in his writing was not a real person , but a figment of geoffrey of monmouth 's imagination .
merlin on film excalibur -lrb- 1981 -rrb- directed by john boorman , this account of the arthurian legend starred nicol williamson as merlin monty python and the holy grail -lrb- 1975 -rrb- the monty python take on the king arthur legends , starring john cleese as an explosion-happy tim the enchanter the sword in the stone -lrb- 1963 -rrb- disney does merlin with karl swenson providing the voice for the bearded one king arthur -lrb- 2004 -rrb- stephen dillane is merlin in a demystified take on the knights of the round table a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court -lrb- 1949 -rrb- strangely , a singing mechanic from 1912 finds himself in camelot , with murvyn vye as a villainous merlin " geoffrey 's purpose was to create a myth for the new anglo-norman aristocracy because they had left france and they had to justify who they were and why they were conquering this new country , " she tells merlin - the legend .
" in order to do this he draws on welsh tradition and he creates this powerful magician figure who becomes the person who organises the birth of arthur and looks after king arthur .
" merlin is a fusion of two characters .
one is wonder child ambrosius , the other is the bard merddyn wilt and geoffrey simply says that there was a character called merlinus ambrosius and suddenly we have merlin . "
according to dr wood , geoffrey not only connected merlin with the origins of the country in his book but also with stonehenge telling stories which manipulated his audience into believing he had magical powers without ever stating categorically that he did .
merlin is also a re-appearing figure in the famous black book of carmarthen , which was written 750 years ago .
maredudd ap huw from the national library of wales said that here he was depicted as a very sorry , tragic character .
" he has obviously had some bad experiences in a battle , " he explained .
" he has become a figure who is living wild outside the boundaries of society .
" and from the hardship that he had suffered out came this wisdom that was respected by other people and held in high esteem . "
in other medieval texts , it seems merlin 's character becomes more established and art historian peter lord says the reappearing character of an old , bearded man in a long gown makes him seem like a " medieval hoody " .
geoffrey of monmouth has it of course that carmarthen was the birthplace of the wizard .
he supposedly lived in a cave on the hill overlooking the town and it is also thought the cave is his tomb .
a festival celebrating carmarthen 's links with arthurian legend has been running in the town since 2004 and people from all over the world make pilgrimages to the town .
during the time of the tudors , it is thought the character of merlin and king arthur were used to bring stability to the country after the wars of the roses .
this is demonstrated in thomas malory 's epic le morte d 'arthur .
here merlin is depicted as an advisor to his king and a stabilising influence from the old world in the tumultuous modern times .
in the 17th and 18th centuries , a growing interest in ancient britain led to merlin being depicted as a druid and bardic figure in both literature and art .
and in the 19th century , as the world went industrial , merlin was depicted more as a romantic figure .
he is overwhelmed by the seductive wiles of a woman in stories and art .
" it is perfect for the 19th century because of the strong gender polarities , " said dr wood .
merlin stories he was half-human , born of a mortal woman and an incubus , or evil spirit , from whom he inherits his natural powers he engineers arthur 's birth by enabling uther pendragon to enter into tintagel in cornwall in disguise and father arthur with his enemy 's wife igraine he created stonehenge as a great memorial for a general in ireland before transporting the whole thing to salisbury plain his downfall came when lusting after a woman called nimue , who coaxed out his magical secrets before using them against him to imprison him in a cave of glass " here is masculine , patriarchal merlin with all of its own certainties giving way to this very , very seductive , very attractive but slightly dangerous power of femininity . "
even nazi germany is said to have seized on merlin 's powerful image to create their own myths and national identity .
the head of the ss , heinrich himmler is believed to have seen himself as a merlin type figure who would advise the king - hitler .
their seizing of the arthurian legends led to friends and fantasy authors jrr tolkien and cs lewis drawing on the complex merlin associations to wage a literary war on the nazis .
but what about now ?
what relevance does the bearded 12th century wizard have on our technology-obsessed , disconnected and alienated society ?
according to dr wood , his influence is alive and well in everything from harry potter to new age spiritualism .
" you can find him in dumbledore and in harry potter himself .
through him children can do what they have always wanted to do which is become magicians themselves , " she said .
" people now are very interested in somehow getting into a spiritual nature and merlin has really become a shaman .
" this is something that reflects the earliest merlin , who was taken over by this kind of poetical ecstasy . "
whatever you take from the tales and depictions of merlin , he has certainly been a powerful and influential character since he was created around 800 years ago .
if only he was real ...

according to dr wood , geoffrey not only connected merlin with the origins of the country in his book but also with stonehenge telling stories which manipulated his audience into believing he had magical powers without ever stating categorically that he did .
merlin is also a re-appearing figure in the famous black book of carmarthen , which was written 750 years ago .
maredudd ap huw from the national library of wales said that here he was depicted as a very sorry , tragic character .
" he has obviously had some bad experiences in a battle , " he explained .
" he has become a figure who is living wild outside the boundaries of society .
" and from the hardship that he had suffered out came this wisdom that was respected by other people and held in high esteem . "
in other medieval texts , it seems merlin 's character becomes more established and art historian peter lord says the reappearing character of an old , bearded man in a long gown makes him seem like a " medieval hoody " .
stories about merlin have been linked to the creation of stonehenge geoffrey of monmouth has it of course that carmarthen was the birthplace of the wizard .
he supposedly lived in a cave on the hill overlooking the town and it is also thought the cave is his tomb .
a festival celebrating carmarthen 's links with arthurian legend has been running in the town since 2004 and people from all over the world make pilgrimages to the town .
during the time of the tudors , it is thought the character of merlin and king arthur were used to bring stability to the country after the wars of the roses .
this is demonstrated in thomas malory 's epic le morte d 'arthur .
here merlin is depicted as an advisor to his king and a stabilising influence from the old world in the tumultuous modern times .
in the 17th and 18th centuries , a growing interest in ancient britain led to merlin being depicted as a druid and bardic figure in both literature and art .
and in the 19th century , as the world went industrial , merlin was depicted more as a romantic figure .
he is overwhelmed by the seductive wiles of a woman in stories and art .
" it is perfect for the 19th century because of the strong gender polarities , " said dr wood .
merlin stories he was half-human , born of a mortal woman and an incubus , or evil spirit , from whom he inherits his natural powers he engineers arthur 's birth by enabling uther pendragon to enter into tintagel in cornwall in disguise and father arthur with his enemy 's wife igraine he created stonehenge as a great memorial for a general in ireland before transporting the whole thing to salisbury plain his downfall came when lusting after a woman called nimue , who coaxed out his magical secrets before using them against him to imprison him in a cave of glass " here is masculine , patriarchal merlin with all of its own certainties giving way to this very , very seductive , very attractive but slightly dangerous power of femininity . "
even nazi germany is said to have seized on merlin 's powerful image to create their own myths and national identity .
the head of the ss , heinrich himmler is believed to have seen himself as a merlin type figure who would advise the king - hitler .
their seizing of the arthurian legends led to friends and fantasy authors jrr tolkien and cs lewis drawing on the complex merlin associations to wage a literary war on the nazis .
but what about now ?
what relevance does the bearded 12th century wizard have on our technology-obsessed , disconnected and alienated society ?
according to dr wood , his influence is alive and well in everything from harry potter to new age spiritualism .
" you can find him in dumbledore and in harry potter himself .
through him children can do what they have always wanted to do which is become magicians themselves , " she said .
" people now are very interested in somehow getting into a spiritual nature and merlin has really become a shaman .
" this is something that reflects the earliest merlin , who was taken over by this kind of poetical ecstasy . "
whatever you take from the tales and depictions of merlin , he has certainly been a powerful and influential character since he was created around 800 years ago .

it was the little-known clergyman geoffrey of monmouth who first wrote about merlin in the 12th century in his book the history of the kings of briton .

but where does this very distinct , vivid image come from ?
it 's certainly very different from the merlin depicted in the new bbc drama series beginning on saturday , which will tell a family-friendly story of the wizard in his formative years .
but the " reality " of the character through the ages is actually quite diverse .
in the tv documentary merlin - the legend , which also screens on the bbc on saturday , historians and experts discuss his origins , his influence through the ages and his supposed welsh links .
it was the little-known clergyman geoffrey of monmouth who first wrote about merlin in the 12th century in his book the history of the kings of briton .
according to dr juliette wood from cardiff university , the merlin who appeared in his writing was not a real person , but a figment of geoffrey of monmouth 's imagination .
merlin on film excalibur -lrb- 1981 -rrb- directed by john boorman , this account of the arthurian legend starred nicol williamson as merlin monty python and the holy grail -lrb- 1975 -rrb- the monty python take on the king arthur legends , starring john cleese as an explosion-happy tim the enchanter the sword in the stone -lrb- 1963 -rrb- disney does merlin with karl swenson providing the voice for the bearded one king arthur -lrb- 2004 -rrb- stephen dillane is merlin in a demystified take on the knights of the round table a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court -lrb- 1949 -rrb- strangely , a singing mechanic from 1912 finds himself in camelot , with murvyn vye as a villainous merlin " geoffrey 's purpose was to create a myth for the new anglo-norman aristocracy because they had left france and they had to justify who they were and why they were conquering this new country , " she tells merlin - the legend .
" in order to do this he draws on welsh tradition and he creates this powerful magician figure who becomes the person who organises the birth of arthur and looks after king arthur .
" merlin is a fusion of two characters .
one is wonder child ambrosius , the other is the bard merddyn wilt and geoffrey simply says that there was a character called merlinus ambrosius and suddenly we have merlin . "
according to dr wood , geoffrey not only connected merlin with the origins of the country in his book but also with stonehenge telling stories which manipulated his audience into believing he had magical powers without ever stating categorically that he did .
merlin is also a re-appearing figure in the famous black book of carmarthen , which was written 750 years ago .
maredudd ap huw from the national library of wales said that here he was depicted as a very sorry , tragic character .
" he has obviously had some bad experiences in a battle , " he explained .
" he has become a figure who is living wild outside the boundaries of society .
" and from the hardship that he had suffered out came this wisdom that was respected by other people and held in high esteem . "
in other medieval texts , it seems merlin 's character becomes more established and art historian peter lord says the reappearing character of an old , bearded man in a long gown makes him seem like a " medieval hoody " .
stories about merlin have been linked to the creation of stonehenge geoffrey of monmouth has it of course that carmarthen was the birthplace of the wizard .
he supposedly lived in a cave on the hill overlooking the town and it is also thought the cave is his tomb .
a festival celebrating carmarthen 's links with arthurian legend has been running in the town since 2004 and people from all over the world make pilgrimages to the town .
during the time of the tudors , it is thought the character of merlin and king arthur were used to bring stability to the country after the wars of the roses .
this is demonstrated in thomas malory 's epic le morte d 'arthur .
here merlin is depicted as an advisor to his king and a stabilising influence from the old world in the tumultuous modern times .
in the 17th and 18th centuries , a growing interest in ancient britain led to merlin being depicted as a druid and bardic figure in both literature and art .
and in the 19th century , as the world went industrial , merlin was depicted more as a romantic figure .
he is overwhelmed by the seductive wiles of a woman in stories and art .
" it is perfect for the 19th century because of the strong gender polarities , " said dr wood .
merlin stories he was half-human , born of a mortal woman and an incubus , or evil spirit , from whom he inherits his natural powers he engineers arthur 's birth by enabling uther pendragon to enter into tintagel in cornwall in disguise and father arthur with his enemy 's wife igraine he created stonehenge as a great memorial for a general in ireland before transporting the whole thing to salisbury plain his downfall came when lusting after a woman called nimue , who coaxed out his magical secrets before using them against him to imprison him in a cave of glass " here is masculine , patriarchal merlin with all of its own certainties giving way to this very , very seductive , very attractive but slightly dangerous power of femininity . "
even nazi germany is said to have seized on merlin 's powerful image to create their own myths and national identity .
the head of the ss , heinrich himmler is believed to have seen himself as a merlin type figure who would advise the king - hitler .
their seizing of the arthurian legends led to friends and fantasy authors jrr tolkien and cs lewis drawing on the complex merlin associations to wage a literary war on the nazis .

ms rowling said she was motivated by labour 's record on child poverty and opposed a conservative plan to give tax breaks to married couples .
her donation will boost gordon brown as he tries to calm unrest among party members at labour 's annual conference .
mr brown said he was delighted to have the backing of " one of the world 's greatest ever authors " .
jk rowling , whose fortune was estimated at £ 560 million in this year 's sunday times rich list , is known to be a personal friend of prime minister gordon brown and his wife sarah .
the labour party has seen a surge in funding from private individuals , who donated a total of £ 3.8m between april and june .
other high-profile donors to have contributed this year include comedian eddie izzard , who gave almost £ 10,000 , and steve lazarides , graffiti artist banksy 's dealer , who gave £ 120,000 . "
the labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty , and is one of the leading eu countries in combating child poverty " jk rowling a statement from ms rowling , who wrote the first of her best-selling books about boy wizard harry potter while an impoverished single mother , pledged support for mr brown 's long-running campaign against child-poverty .
she said : " i believe that poor and vulnerable families will fare much better under the labour party than they would under a cameron-led conservative party .
" gordon brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice .
have your say " i suspect this annual get-together will be furthermore known as the harry potter conference , full of make-believe , spin , wizardry , mystique and not a happy ending " andy , milton keynes send us your comments " the labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty , and is one of the leading eu countries in combating child poverty .
" david cameron 's promise of tax perks for the married , on the other hand , is reminiscent of the conservative government i experienced as a lone parent .
" it sends the message that the conservatives still believe a childless , dual-income , but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling , as i once was , to keep their families afloat in difficult times . "
' penalty on families ' labour 's deputy leader harriet harman welcomed the donation during a visit to a sure start children 's centre in manchester with the prime minister .
brownometer a great way to kick off the conference for the pm .
it may not ease his leadership worries but it shows he still has pulling power with donors , even if jk rowling is an old family friend .
full labour conference coverage ms harman acknowledged that raising a daughter alone had been a struggle for ms rowling and said she was delighted with the reasons the author had given for backing the party .
" she 's particularly concerned about the conservatives ' proposal which would put a penalty on families with young children if the parents had separated , " ms harman added .
a conservative spokesman said the party would not be responding to jk rowling 's comments .
ms rowling split from her first husband , portuguese journalist jorges arantes , shortly after their daughter jessica was born in 1993 .
she wrote much of her first harry potter book in an edinburgh cafe , where she found it easier to work than at her " grotty and depressing " council home .
single parent recognising she was a poor single parent , the cafe owners would let ms rowling nurse an espresso and water all day as she worked with her daughter sleeping beside her in a pram .
the author married second husband , dr neil murray , in 2001 and the couple have a son , david gordon , and daughter , mackenzie jean .
her £ 1m donation is the first time the children 's author has given cash to the labour party , which currently has debts totalling around £ 18m .
the prime minister said : " i am delighted that jk rowling , who is one of the world 's greatest ever authors , has made such a generous donation .
" i thank her for supporting the labour party and our values of social justice and opportunity for all . "
much of labour 's £ 17.9m debt was amassed to fund the 2005 general election campaign , the most expensive in the party 's history .
a source indicated that jk rowling 's money would not simply be swallowed up in debt repayments , but would allow the party to continue with its work .

a low-key concert is held every year to thank local people for putting up with the festival .
coldplay , the stone roses and keane have appeared in the past .
franz ferdinand and the ting tings will now be on the bill at glastonbury 2009 .
one fan , george boucher from pilton , somerset , said the show was " like a little mini part " of the main event .
' absolutely miniscule ' the pilton equinox party attracted 3,500 people on friday , compared with the 177,500 who make the trip in mid-summer .
it was held in what is normally the festival 's cinema field , with none of the customary rain or mud on a fine autumn evening .
the valley 's returned to its peaceful state , with the cows chewing on the cud beneath the frame of the pyramid stage alex kapranos franz ferdinand and without five days of camping and drinking , the equinox crowd appeared remarkably smart and clean .
the same could be said for the toilets .
" it seems like a secret festival for people who live around here and put up with the craziness of glastonbury in their back yard , " said franz ferdinand singer alex kapranos .
" the normal glastonbury is 180,000 people in this beautiful rolling english valley .
it 's a very colourful splatter of anarchy across the landscape , which is kind of exciting .

" it 's a bit of payback for the local community .
the money 's used for local projects and it 's really worthwhile .
i think people are happy to support that . "
some 3,500 people were at friday 's pilton equinox party unlike the main festival , which began in 1970 , no-one is quite sure when the locals ' gig started .
some fans recall its origins as part of a village fete where organiser michael eavis would lay on big-name blues bands .
it became the pilton pop party in the 1990s , when it was held in a smaller marquee in the village playing fields , with mr eavis and his wife jean manning the gates .
its most legendary performance came in 1995 , after the stone roses pulled out of the main festival because guitarist john squire had broken his collarbone .
so the band decided to make their long-awaited uk comeback at the tiny , unannounced show , before the marquee hosted the village flower show later that weekend .
it 's basically a thank you to the village for putting up with all of the grief emily eavis " the stone roses really put it on the map , " said emily eavis , mr eavis ' daughter , who is now one of the festival organisers .
" ever since then , it 's been a really exciting gig for loads of local people .
it 's basically a thank you to the village for putting up with all of the grief , and all of the money goes straight to the village . "
last year , massive attack , seasick steve and reverend and the makers helped raise almost £ 40,000 for the pilton parish hall , the working men 's club and the pilton playing fields association .
crowd-pleasing set this year , franz ferdinand had to play without drummer paul thomson , who returned to glasgow as his wife went into labour . twenty minutes before they took the stage , the band were told she had given birth to a boy , kapranos told the crowd .
ms eavis ' boyfriend stepped in to play drums on two tracks , with the band 's drum technician filling in on another two .
both bands had good performances this year and i expect we 'll see them somewhere on the bill next year emily eavis the three remaining band members played three more acoustic songs , but decided not to showcase any material from their new album , instead playing a set of crowd-pleasing hits .

a low-key concert is held every year to thank local people for putting up with the festival .
coldplay , the stone roses and keane have appeared in the past .
franz ferdinand and the ting tings will now be on the bill at glastonbury 2009 .
one fan , george boucher from pilton , somerset , said the show was " like a little mini part " of the main event .
' absolutely miniscule ' the pilton equinox party attracted 3,500 people on friday , compared with the 177,500 who make the trip in mid-summer .
it was held in what is normally the festival 's cinema field , with none of the customary rain or mud on a fine autumn evening .
the valley 's returned to its peaceful state , with the cows chewing on the cud beneath the frame of the pyramid stage alex kapranos franz ferdinand and without five days of camping and drinking , the equinox crowd appeared remarkably smart and clean .
the same could be said for the toilets .
" it seems like a secret festival for people who live around here and put up with the craziness of glastonbury in their back yard , " said franz ferdinand singer alex kapranos .
" the normal glastonbury is 180,000 people in this beautiful rolling english valley .
it 's a very colourful splatter of anarchy across the landscape , which is kind of exciting .
" and now the valley 's returned to its peaceful state , with the cows chewing on the cud beneath the frame of the pyramid stage .
" and up here , where the cinema stage is normally , there 's a tent set up .
it 's a very different vibe from the main glastonbury festival itself . "
the crowd in the large marquee saw franz ferdinand play their highly infectious art rock , while the ting tings ' stripped-down shouty pop went down a storm .
you 've got the right number of people here , it 's got the right vibe for a festival , but it 's compact into one night george boucher " miniscule .
absolutely miniscule , " was one fan 's comparison with the main festival .
" it 's like one of the 50 stages . "
she gave her name as lily leapordlove , revealing a leopardskin suit beneath a thick coat .
" it 's like a little mini part of saturday night .
you could be in any one of the -lsb- festival -rsb- fields , " said mr boucher , 28 , who has lived with the event all his life .
" it 's just squeezed down into proportion .
you 've got the right number of people here , it 's got the right vibe for a festival , but it 's compact into one night . "
roses comeback christian hughes , from nearby wells , added : " it 's a very , very tiny little taster of what the festival is like .
" it 's a bit of payback for the local community .
the money 's used for local projects and it 's really worthwhile .
i think people are happy to support that . "
some 3,500 people were at friday 's pilton equinox party unlike the main festival , which began in 1970 , no-one is quite sure when the locals ' gig started .
some fans recall its origins as part of a village fete where organiser michael eavis would lay on big-name blues bands .
it became the pilton pop party in the 1990s , when it was held in a smaller marquee in the village playing fields , with mr eavis and his wife jean manning the gates .
its most legendary performance came in 1995 , after the stone roses pulled out of the main festival because guitarist john squire had broken his collarbone .
so the band decided to make their long-awaited uk comeback at the tiny , unannounced show , before the marquee hosted the village flower show later that weekend .
it 's basically a thank you to the village for putting up with all of the grief emily eavis " the stone roses really put it on the map , " said emily eavis , mr eavis ' daughter , who is now one of the festival organisers .
" ever since then , it 's been a really exciting gig for loads of local people .
it 's basically a thank you to the village for putting up with all of the grief , and all of the money goes straight to the village . "
last year , massive attack , seasick steve and reverend and the makers helped raise almost £ 40,000 for the pilton parish hall , the working men 's club and the pilton playing fields association .
crowd-pleasing set this year , franz ferdinand had to play without drummer paul thomson , who returned to glasgow as his wife went into labour . twenty minutes before they took the stage , the band were told she had given birth to a boy , kapranos told the crowd .
ms eavis ' boyfriend stepped in to play drums on two tracks , with the band 's drum technician filling in on another two .
both bands had good performances this year and i expect we 'll see them somewhere on the bill next year emily eavis the three remaining band members played three more acoustic songs , but decided not to showcase any material from their new album , instead playing a set of crowd-pleasing hits .
but franz ferdinand and the ting tings will be back next june , ms eavis said .
" both bands had good performances this year and i expect we 'll see them somewhere on the bill next year , " she said .
but she denied that playing at the equinox was part of a deal for franz ferdinand to headline next year 's festival .
" it 's not as cut and dry as that but it 's a little taster … it 's good for the village to get things first . "
tickets for next year 's festival will be available to buy , or reserve for a £ 50 deposit , from 5 october .
the passes will cost £ 175 and all fans must have registered their details with the festival before they can book their places .

a low-key concert is held every year to thank local people for putting up with the festival .
coldplay , the stone roses and keane have appeared in the past .
franz ferdinand and the ting tings will now be on the bill at glastonbury 2009 .
one fan , george boucher from pilton , somerset , said the show was " like a little mini part " of the main event .
' absolutely miniscule ' the pilton equinox party attracted 3,500 people on friday , compared with the 177,500 who make the trip in mid-summer .
it was held in what is normally the festival 's cinema field , with none of the customary rain or mud on a fine autumn evening . "
the valley 's returned to its peaceful state , with the cows chewing on the cud beneath the frame of the pyramid stage " alex kapranos franz ferdinand and without five days of camping and drinking , the equinox crowd appeared remarkably smart and clean .
the same could be said for the toilets .
" it seems like a secret festival for people who live around here and put up with the craziness of glastonbury in their back yard , " said franz ferdinand singer alex kapranos .
" the normal glastonbury is 180,000 people in this beautiful rolling english valley .
it 's a very colourful splatter of anarchy across the landscape , which is kind of exciting .
" and now the valley 's returned to its peaceful state , with the cows chewing on the cud beneath the frame of the pyramid stage .
" and up here , where the cinema stage is normally , there 's a tent set up .
it 's a very different vibe from the main glastonbury festival itself . "
the crowd in the large marquee saw franz ferdinand play their highly infectious art rock , while the ting tings ' stripped-down shouty pop went down a storm . "
you 've got the right number of people here , it 's got the right vibe for a festival , but it 's compact into one night " george boucher " miniscule .
absolutely miniscule , " was one fan 's comparison with the main festival .
" it 's like one of the 50 stages . "
she gave her name as lily leapordlove , revealing a leopardskin suit beneath a thick coat .
" it 's like a little mini part of saturday night .
you could be in any one of the -lsb- festival -rsb- fields , " said mr boucher , 28 , who has lived with the event all his life .
" it 's just squeezed down into proportion .
you 've got the right number of people here , it 's got the right vibe for a festival , but it 's compact into one night . "
roses comeback christian hughes , from nearby wells , added : " it 's a very , very tiny little taster of what the festival is like .
" it 's a bit of payback for the local community .
the money 's used for local projects and it 's really worthwhile .
i think people are happy to support that . "
unlike the main festival , which began in 1970 , no-one is quite sure when the locals ' gig started .
some fans recall its origins as part of a village fete where organiser michael eavis would lay on big-name blues bands .
it became the pilton pop party in the 1990s , when it was held in a smaller marquee in the village playing fields , with mr eavis and his wife jean manning the gates .
its most legendary performance came in 1995 , after the stone roses pulled out of the main festival because guitarist john squire had broken his collarbone .
so the band decided to make their long-awaited uk comeback at the tiny , unannounced show , before the marquee hosted the village flower show later that weekend . "
it 's basically a thank you to the village for putting up with all of the grief " emily eavis " the stone roses really put it on the map , " said emily eavis , mr eavis ' daughter , who is now one of the festival organisers .
" ever since then , it 's been a really exciting gig for loads of local people .
it 's basically a thank you to the village for putting up with all of the grief , and all of the money goes straight to the village . "
last year , massive attack , seasick steve and reverend and the makers helped raise almost £ 40,000 for the pilton parish hall , the working men 's club and the pilton playing fields association .
crowd-pleasing set this year , franz ferdinand had to play without drummer paul thomson , who returned to glasgow as his wife went into labour . twenty minutes before they took the stage , the band were told she had given birth to a boy , kapranos told the crowd .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- us television 's emmys get ' real ' bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture 10:50 gmt , saturday , 20 september 2008 11:50 uk us television 's emmys get ' real ' by peter bowes bbc news , los angeles american television 's annual awards extravaganza is bowing to the inevitable and preparing to put on a show that honours the growing phenomenon of reality tv .
in the past decade it is a genre of entertainment that has exploded onto tv screens and captivated audiences .
but it has been given relatively little attention by the academy of television arts & sciences , which puts on the emmys .
increasingly the show has been dominated by little-seen , but critically acclaimed comedies and dramas .
this year is no exception .
" there is n't a clunker anywhere , " says mary mcnamara , television critic for the los angeles times .
" we had great television last year .
you have a lot of really great shows but a lot of the shows do n't have huge numbers , " she says .
the drama , mad men , which is set in the advertising industry in the 1960s , has 16 nominations .
it has been widely lauded by critics , but relatively few americans have seen it .
less than 2 million people tuned in for the latest episode compared with the 20 million that routinely tuned in for american idol , earlier this year .
backlash " critics are saying , why are n't we seeing the shows that are huge getting the nominations , and the shows that are huge are obviously the reality shows , " says ms mcnamara .
" i think there was stodginess , a prejudice against it . "
there has also been an industry backlash against reality tv because it relies so much on unscripted content and does not involve professional actors . "
television has changed … it 's not just about small movies on tv any more . "
heidi klum , host , project runway the long-running writers ' dispute was , in part , over union control of so-called unscripted programmes .
the strike ended but the matter was not resolved .
so with a backdrop of unease and some resentment that reality tv has flourished , while more traditional forms of television have struggled , the tv academy has decided to give it a central role in this weekend 's show .
a new category has been created and the academy will anoint its first outstanding host for a reality or reality-competition programme .
unusually , the nominees in the category have also been chosen to host the entire emmys show .
american idol 's ryan seacrest will join forces with tom bergeron -lrb- dancing with the stars -rrb- , howie mandel -lrb- deal or no deal -rrb- , jeff probst -lrb- survivor -rrb- and the german model heidi klum , who presents the fashion-based reality show , project runway .
' evolution ' " television has changed … it 's not just about small movies on tv any more or the things that we are used to watch on television , " say klum .
" over the last ten years , reality television has become part of our culture .
so i think to add that to the emmys is just right . "
a reality show is loosely defined as one which is unscripted and involves ordinary people .
the genre includes programmes that , once upon a time , were simply called game shows or talent contests .
" throughout the last few years we 've seen the evolution of unscripted shows and their popularity with audiences , " says seacrest .
the organisers will be hoping that the reality hosts ' collective audience of about 70 million , in the us , will somehow rub off on the emmys .
last year 's telecast was watched by just 13 million , the second-smallest emmy audience on record .
" it 's going to be interesting to see how it works , " says ms mcnamara .
" heidi klum - god bless her , and i love her show - is not the most vibrant personality on live television . "
the tv critic expects mandel , a stand up comic , and probst , to " do fine . "
but she is not convinced that splitting the presenting duties five ways will work .
" i think the risk that they run is that it is going to be very uneven - you 're going to have dead air and good air . "
