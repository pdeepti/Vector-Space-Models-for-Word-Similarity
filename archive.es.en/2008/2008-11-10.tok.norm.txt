that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .
the price of shares in the group jumped by 8.82 percent to 10.18 euros in midday trading , while the dax index of leading shares had gained 3.17 percent overall . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

43 sobibor , " the date he allegedly began work in the death camp german investigators handed over monday what they said was adequate evidence to try a former ukrainian , ivan john demjanjuk , for nazi war crimes .
he was a former death camp guard now living in the us . the file on demjanjuk , who was nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " was compiled by the german national office for solving nazi crimes . the head of the office , kurt schrimm , said he hopes the prosecutors in munich will seek extradition of 88-year-old demjanjuk from the united states , where he immigrated in the 1950s and worked in the car industry . ukrainian-born demjanjuk is accused of having having participated in the murder in 1943 of at least 29,000 european jews at the death camps in sobibor and treblinka , poland , during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan john demjanjuk arrives at the federal building in cleveland in 2005 " we have managed to obtain hundred of documents and have also found a number of witnesses who spoke out against demjanjuk , " schrimm told the reuters news agency . " for the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers .
we have no doubt that he is responsible for the death of over 29,000 jews , " schrimm added . us authorities extradited him to israel in 1986 after his alleged role in the holocaust became known in the 1970s . he was accused of crimes committed at the treblinka death camp , where survivors said he was given the nickname ivan the terrible for his alleged crimes . identity questions demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988 , but the israeli supreme court overturned the verdict in 1990 , saying that it could not be proven that he was the same person as ivan the terrible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews being sent to the treblinka death camp , where demjanjuk also worked as a guard now demjanjuk 's identity , schrimm said , has been " 100 percent " established . the german nazi hunters are now convinced that their investigation has brought new evidence about his activities in sobibor .
they said germany has jurisdiction because 1,900 jewish victims were german citizens . currently demjanjuk is stateless and ukraine refuses to take him back .
munich prosecutors are to be asked to take on the case because demjanjuk lived near there till moving to the united states in 1952 , where he changed his name to john . schrimm said the decision was up to the munich prosecutors .
his team had provided hundreds of pages of documentation from archives in israel , the united states and various sites in germany . the investigation office , which has faced criticism from israeli-based groups for not delivering results , celebrates its 50th anniversary on december 1 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .

new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .

military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .
" i hope that i have not closed all doors because of one mistake , " he said .
" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .
but at the moment everything is fine the way it is . "
kuranyi , who has since had a telephone conversation with loew and apologized for his actions , said that he tried to explain why he left the stadium .
kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "
he added , however , that in principle he did not regret his actions .

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elsewhere , wiring and signal gear along german railway lines were set on fire .
though most of the attacks were anonymous , police said it was likely the sabotage was the work of anti-nuclear militants .
by early sunday afternoon , the train , loaded with 17 tons of waste pellets encapsulated in 100 tons of insulating glass , had reached goettingen in central germany .

berlin plans to dump the waste long-term in an old salt-mine .
the anti-nuclear movement seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations and has been upset at debate in germany about extending the stations ' operation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming .
the issue has intensified in germany after revelations that another salt-mine dump , near wolfenbuettel , has developed leaks and cracks .
on saturday , the freight train was delayed for about 12 hours by three militants who chained themselves to a lump of concrete under a track near the french border .

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

43 sobibor , " the date he allegedly began work in the death camp german investigators handed over monday what they said was adequate evidence to try a former ukrainian , ivan john demjanjuk , for nazi war crimes .
he was a former death camp guard now living in the us . the file on demjanjuk , who was nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " was compiled by the german national office for solving nazi crimes . the head of the office , kurt schrimm , said he hopes the prosecutors in munich will seek extradition of 88-year-old demjanjuk from the united states , where he immigrated in the 1950s and worked in the car industry . ukrainian-born demjanjuk is accused of having having participated in the murder in 1943 of at least 29,000 european jews at the death camps in sobibor and treblinka , poland , during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan john demjanjuk arrives at the federal building in cleveland in 2005 " we have managed to obtain hundred of documents and have also found a number of witnesses who spoke out against demjanjuk , " schrimm told the reuters news agency . " for the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers .
we have no doubt that he is responsible for the death of over 29,000 jews , " schrimm added . us authorities extradited him to israel in 1986 after his alleged role in the holocaust became known in the 1970s . he was accused of crimes committed at the treblinka death camp , where survivors said he was given the nickname ivan the terrible for his alleged crimes . identity questions demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988 , but the israeli supreme court overturned the verdict in 1990 , saying that it could not be proven that he was the same person as ivan the terrible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews being sent to the treblinka death camp , where demjanjuk also worked as a guard now demjanjuk 's identity , schrimm said , has been " 100 percent " established . the german nazi hunters are now convinced that their investigation has brought new evidence about his activities in sobibor .
they said germany has jurisdiction because 1,900 jewish victims were german citizens . currently demjanjuk is stateless and ukraine refuses to take him back .
munich prosecutors are to be asked to take on the case because demjanjuk lived near there till moving to the united states in 1952 , where he changed his name to john . schrimm said the decision was up to the munich prosecutors .
his team had provided hundreds of pages of documentation from archives in israel , the united states and various sites in germany . the investigation office , which has faced criticism from israeli-based groups for not delivering results , celebrates its 50th anniversary on december 1 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany contributes to the nato rapid reaction force " nato could react with its rapid reaction force , " launched in 2003 , which allows the alliance to speedily deploy up to 25,000 troops anywhere , solaja said .
military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "
" the rs government has nothing against maintaining the military presence in bosnia , " he told reporters , adding , however , that it was time to remove the office of the international envoy in bosnia .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .
the price of shares in the group jumped by 8.82 percent to 10.18 euros in midday trading , while the dax index of leading shares had gained 3.17 percent overall . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

43 sobibor , " the date he allegedly began work in the death camp german investigators handed over monday what they said was adequate evidence to try a former ukrainian , ivan john demjanjuk , for nazi war crimes .
he was a former death camp guard now living in the us . the file on demjanjuk , who was nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " was compiled by the german national office for solving nazi crimes . the head of the office , kurt schrimm , said he hopes the prosecutors in munich will seek extradition of 88-year-old demjanjuk from the united states , where he immigrated in the 1950s and worked in the car industry . ukrainian-born demjanjuk is accused of having having participated in the murder in 1943 of at least 29,000 european jews at the death camps in sobibor and treblinka , poland , during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan john demjanjuk arrives at the federal building in cleveland in 2005 " we have managed to obtain hundred of documents and have also found a number of witnesses who spoke out against demjanjuk , " schrimm told the reuters news agency . " for the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers .
we have no doubt that he is responsible for the death of over 29,000 jews , " schrimm added . us authorities extradited him to israel in 1986 after his alleged role in the holocaust became known in the 1970s . he was accused of crimes committed at the treblinka death camp , where survivors said he was given the nickname ivan the terrible for his alleged crimes . identity questions demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988 , but the israeli supreme court overturned the verdict in 1990 , saying that it could not be proven that he was the same person as ivan the terrible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews being sent to the treblinka death camp , where demjanjuk also worked as a guard now demjanjuk 's identity , schrimm said , has been " 100 percent " established . the german nazi hunters are now convinced that their investigation has brought new evidence about his activities in sobibor .
they said germany has jurisdiction because 1,900 jewish victims were german citizens . currently demjanjuk is stateless and ukraine refuses to take him back .
munich prosecutors are to be asked to take on the case because demjanjuk lived near there till moving to the united states in 1952 , where he changed his name to john . schrimm said the decision was up to the munich prosecutors .
his team had provided hundreds of pages of documentation from archives in israel , the united states and various sites in germany . the investigation office , which has faced criticism from israeli-based groups for not delivering results , celebrates its 50th anniversary on december 1 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .

but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .

following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 10.11.2008 rwanda angry at arrest in germany of presidential aide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kabuye was arrested at frankfurt airport german police have arrested rose kabuye , chief of protocol for rwandan president paul kagame .
she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elsewhere , wiring and signal gear along german railway lines were set on fire .
though most of the attacks were anonymous , police said it was likely the sabotage was the work of anti-nuclear militants .
by early sunday afternoon , the train , loaded with 17 tons of waste pellets encapsulated in 100 tons of insulating glass , had reached goettingen in central germany .
to the north , at hitzacker , close to the waste warehouse , protesters defied a ban on demonstrations near the railway and invaded the line .
some tried to damage it , a police spokesman said .
riot police using batons dispersed the crowd back into nearby woods .
protesters set fire to bales of straw on the rails , which were extinguished by police water-cannon .
a lower saxony state police spokesman said police had used force , as the protesters had used force .

at gorleben many tons of radioactive waste have been accumulated from german power stations after being sealed into glass pellets at a factory in france .
berlin plans to dump the waste long-term in an old salt-mine .
the anti-nuclear movement seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations and has been upset at debate in germany about extending the stations ' operation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming .
the issue has intensified in germany after revelations that another salt-mine dump , near wolfenbuettel , has developed leaks and cracks .
on saturday , the freight train was delayed for about 12 hours by three militants who chained themselves to a lump of concrete under a track near the french border .
police had to carefully dismantle the concrete to detach the trio , delaying the entire transport operation . dw staff -lrb- nda / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elsewhere , wiring and signal gear along german railway lines were set on fire .
though most of the attacks were anonymous , police said it was likely the sabotage was the work of anti-nuclear militants .
by early sunday afternoon , the train , loaded with 17 tons of waste pellets encapsulated in 100 tons of insulating glass , had reached goettingen in central germany .
to the north , at hitzacker , close to the waste warehouse , protesters defied a ban on demonstrations near the railway and invaded the line .
some tried to damage it , a police spokesman said .
riot police using batons dispersed the crowd back into nearby woods .
protesters set fire to bales of straw on the rails , which were extinguished by police water-cannon .

at gorleben many tons of radioactive waste have been accumulated from german power stations after being sealed into glass pellets at a factory in france .
berlin plans to dump the waste long-term in an old salt-mine .
the anti-nuclear movement seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations and has been upset at debate in germany about extending the stations ' operation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming .
the issue has intensified in germany after revelations that another salt-mine dump , near wolfenbuettel , has developed leaks and cracks .
on saturday , the freight train was delayed for about 12 hours by three militants who chained themselves to a lump of concrete under a track near the french border .
police had to carefully dismantle the concrete to detach the trio , delaying the entire transport operation . dw staff -lrb- nda / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it said it was making the appeal with four other rights groups in the expectation that the next us president , barack obama , would close the detention center in cuba .
about 250 people accused of being terrorists are currently held at the camp .
some 80 are expected to face trial by court martial .
amnesty said the remainder included 50 from nations such as china , libya , russia , tunisia and uzbekistan .
the human-rights groups made their call after a two-day workshop in berlin .
" guantanamo can not be closed until these men have a country which will accept them , and where their lives and liberty are not in jeopardy , " the statement said .
obama to move guantanamo issue forward separately , advisers to president-elect barack obama have said they were putting together a proposal to ship dozens of the imprisoned terrorism suspects to the us to face criminal trial .
under the plans , some detainees would be released and others would face prosecution .
the resolution of the issues surrounding guantanamo bay may require the creation of a new system of justice designed to handle sensitive national-security cases , the advisers said .
if the proposal is carried through it would make good on obama 's election campaign pledge to close the controversial detention facility . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .

" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 10.11.2008 eu to strengthen engagement in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu replaced the un as the peacekeeping force in bosnia in 2003 as eu defense ministers review the fate of europe 's peacekeeping mission in bosnia , officials say the country can count on strengthened engagement as it pursues eu-backed reforms . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and expansion commissioner olli rehn said the office of the high representative - the chief civilian peace implementation agency - should be closed down by the end of next year .
but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany contributes to the nato rapid reaction force " nato could react with its rapid reaction force , " launched in 2003 , which allows the alliance to speedily deploy up to 25,000 troops anywhere , solaja said .
military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "
" the rs government has nothing against maintaining the military presence in bosnia , " he told reporters , adding , however , that it was time to remove the office of the international envoy in bosnia .
" with the ohr , bosnia is not a sovereign country , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .

dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .

military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...

eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany contributes to the nato rapid reaction force " nato could react with its rapid reaction force , " launched in 2003 , which allows the alliance to speedily deploy up to 25,000 troops anywhere , solaja said .
military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "
" the rs government has nothing against maintaining the military presence in bosnia , " he told reporters , adding , however , that it was time to remove the office of the international envoy in bosnia .
" with the ohr , bosnia is not a sovereign country , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the train carrying the waste from france arrived at dannenberg terminal in lower saxony early monday , nov .
10 , at 1:15 am cet with a 14-hour delay after protests tried several times to halt the transport , police said . as during 10 previous shipments of waste to long-term storage in the small town south of hamburg , protesters aimed to obstruct the freight train . at dannenberg , the 11 containers carrying the waste will be transferred to trucks which are to take them the final 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to gorleben . clashes with police riot police had clashed with 700 protesters sunday in the north of germany as the anti-nuclear movement tried to disrupt the train 's journey .
elsewhere , wiring and signal gear along german railway lines were set on fire .
though most of the attacks were anonymous , police said it was likely the sabotage was the work of anti-nuclear militants .
by early sunday afternoon , the train , loaded with 17 tons of waste pellets encapsulated in 100 tons of insulating glass , had reached goettingen in central germany .
to the north , at hitzacker , close to the waste warehouse , protesters defied a ban on demonstrations near the railway and invaded the line .
some tried to damage it , a police spokesman said .
riot police using batons dispersed the crowd back into nearby woods .
protesters set fire to bales of straw on the rails , which were extinguished by police water-cannon .
a lower saxony state police spokesman said police had used force , as the protesters had used force .

at gorleben many tons of radioactive waste have been accumulated from german power stations after being sealed into glass pellets at a factory in france .
berlin plans to dump the waste long-term in an old salt-mine .
the anti-nuclear movement seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations and has been upset at debate in germany about extending the stations ' operation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming .
the issue has intensified in germany after revelations that another salt-mine dump , near wolfenbuettel , has developed leaks and cracks .
on saturday , the freight train was delayed for about 12 hours by three militants who chained themselves to a lump of concrete under a track near the french border .
police had to carefully dismantle the concrete to detach the trio , delaying the entire transport operation . dw staff -lrb- nda / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 is not only a day of celebration in german history nov .
9 has played an important role throughout germany 's history .
dw-world takes a look at some important events that took place on that day . nov .
9 , 1989 was n't meant to be a watershed in german history .
while the communist leadership of east germany had decided to allow citizens to travel freely on that day , the change in policy was not supposed to take effect until nov .
10 to give border guards time to prepare . but guenter schabowski , a member of the east german politburo , who announced the decision at a press conference had not been present at the meeting .
asked by reporters when the new regulation would take effect , he said : " immediately . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schabowski during his historic press conference on nov .
9 , 1989 watching schabowski 's statement on television , thousands of east berliners rushed to crossing points to west berlin , where overwhelmed border guards soon decided to let them pass . thus , nov .
9 yet again became a german " day of destiny " marking the first , triumphant steps towards the country 's reunification .
but while germans had a reason to celebrate on that date in 1989 , another event that took place 51 years earlier on nov .
9 remains one of the darkest in the country 's history . 1938 : jewish pogrom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a jewish shop in berlin the day after " kristallnacht " using the nov .
7 , 1938 assassination of a german diplomat in paris by a german-polish jew as an excuse , the so-called reichskristallnacht two days later rang in the nazis ' brutal persecution of jews that would eventually end in the murder of millions of people . while the 1935 nazi race laws had already severely affected jewish life in germany , members of the nazi sa militia across the country now torched synagogues and destroyed jewish stores .
about 100 people were killed during the pogrom and about 30,000 jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps . 1923 : hitler putsch nazi leaders , including adolf hitler , had meanwhile gathered in munich to commemorate the 15th anniversary of another nov .
9 event : hitler 's failed putsch attempt of 1923 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bust of hitler in the german historical museum 's depository worried that other nationalistic , right-wing groups might overshadow his emerging nazi party -lrb- nsdap -rrb- , hitler and his followers on nov .
8 stormed a meeting of bavarian government officials in a munich restaurant and forced them at gunpoint to support his revolution . when the men revoked their agreement to cooperate a few hours later , hitler led a march on the center of munich , which was broken up by police .
the nsdap was banned as a result and hitler ended up spending a few months in prison . 1918 : proclamation of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp scheidemann unlike the other nov .
9 events , the putsch attempt did not fall on that date by coincidence , according to heinrich august winkler , one of germany 's most renowned historians .
hitler 's march on munich took place exactly five years after the proclamation of the german republic by social democratic politician philipp scheidemann , which came just two days before the end of world war i. " many germans saw the parliamentary democracy not as a new beginning , but as a consequence of the lost war as well as an instrument of the victors , " winkler told german daily die welt , adding that right-wing supporters rejected the republic as " non-german . " 1848 : killing revolutionary dreams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national assembly in frankfurt 's st. paul 's church was disbanded on may 30 , 1849 another event significant for german history took place on nov .
9 , 1848 - the execution of robert blum , a member of the frankfurt national assembly , a legislative body meant to create a constitution for a unified germany . ignoring his immunity as a parliamentarian , blum was sentenced to death by austria 's imperial government after supporting viennese revolutionaries .
his execution showed the parliament 's powerlessness and made blum a symbol of the failed attempt to create a unified and free germany . no alternative national day few people might think of blum 's execution when asked about significant events for german history on nov .
9 .
but according to a 2008 opinion poll , an increasing number of germans also has trouble remembering that the event which did eventually lead to a unified and free germany took place on that date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , everyone 's free to pass through brandenburg gate asked " what happened on nov .
9 , 1989 , " every third person questioned did n't know the answer .
of those aged 29 and younger , 42 percent could n't connect the fall of the wall with nov .
9 . " i do n't think it 's a good idea to make it a national day , " he said , adding that nov .
9 should be a german day of reflection instead .

43 sobibor , " the date he allegedly began work in the death camp german investigators handed over monday what they said was adequate evidence to try a former ukrainian , ivan john demjanjuk , for nazi war crimes .
he was a former death camp guard now living in the us . the file on demjanjuk , who was nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " was compiled by the german national office for solving nazi crimes . the head of the office , kurt schrimm , said he hopes the prosecutors in munich will seek extradition of 88-year-old demjanjuk from the united states , where he immigrated in the 1950s and worked in the car industry . ukrainian-born demjanjuk is accused of having having participated in the murder in 1943 of at least 29,000 european jews at the death camps in sobibor and treblinka , poland , during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan john demjanjuk arrives at the federal building in cleveland in 2005 " we have managed to obtain hundred of documents and have also found a number of witnesses who spoke out against demjanjuk , " schrimm told the reuters news agency . " for the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers .
we have no doubt that he is responsible for the death of over 29,000 jews , " schrimm added . us authorities extradited him to israel in 1986 after his alleged role in the holocaust became known in the 1970s . he was accused of crimes committed at the treblinka death camp , where survivors said he was given the nickname ivan the terrible for his alleged crimes . identity questions demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988 , but the israeli supreme court overturned the verdict in 1990 , saying that it could not be proven that he was the same person as ivan the terrible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews being sent to the treblinka death camp , where demjanjuk also worked as a guard now demjanjuk 's identity , schrimm said , has been " 100 percent " established . the german nazi hunters are now convinced that their investigation has brought new evidence about his activities in sobibor .
they said germany has jurisdiction because 1,900 jewish victims were german citizens . currently demjanjuk is stateless and ukraine refuses to take him back .
munich prosecutors are to be asked to take on the case because demjanjuk lived near there till moving to the united states in 1952 , where he changed his name to john . schrimm said the decision was up to the munich prosecutors .
his team had provided hundreds of pages of documentation from archives in israel , the united states and various sites in germany . the investigation office , which has faced criticism from israeli-based groups for not delivering results , celebrates its 50th anniversary on december 1 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .
the price of shares in the group jumped by 8.82 percent to 10.18 euros in midday trading , while the dax index of leading shares had gained 3.17 percent overall . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany contributes to the nato rapid reaction force " nato could react with its rapid reaction force , " launched in 2003 , which allows the alliance to speedily deploy up to 25,000 troops anywhere , solaja said .
military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "
" the rs government has nothing against maintaining the military presence in bosnia , " he told reporters , adding , however , that it was time to remove the office of the international envoy in bosnia .
" with the ohr , bosnia is not a sovereign country , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .
" i hope that i have not closed all doors because of one mistake , " he said .
" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .
but at the moment everything is fine the way it is . "
kuranyi , who has since had a telephone conversation with loew and apologized for his actions , said that he tried to explain why he left the stadium .
kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "
he added , however , that in principle he did not regret his actions .

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .
1 in protest of russia 's military action in georgia .
but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .
the eu will stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations , " the statement said ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
breakdown of talks after georgia war on sept .
1 , following russia 's occupation of parts of georgia , eu leaders at an emergency summit decided to postpone talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement " until russian troops pulled back to the lines they occupied before the war broke out on aug .
7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has 200 observers stationed in georgia the new agreement is meant to replace a partnership and cooperation agreement signed in 1997 , and is intended to give a legal basis to eu-russia relations on everything from energy to culture .
following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .
" the choice is very clear : do we want to bilateralize our relations with russia or do we want to have a clear eu-russia policy ? "

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .
the price of shares in the group jumped by 8.82 percent to 10.18 euros in midday trading , while the dax index of leading shares had gained 3.17 percent overall . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .

military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "
" the rs government has nothing against maintaining the military presence in bosnia , " he told reporters , adding , however , that it was time to remove the office of the international envoy in bosnia .

43 sobibor , " the date he allegedly began work in the death camp german investigators handed over monday what they said was adequate evidence to try a former ukrainian , ivan john demjanjuk , for nazi war crimes .
he was a former death camp guard now living in the us . the file on demjanjuk , who was nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " was compiled by the german national office for solving nazi crimes . the head of the office , kurt schrimm , said he hopes the prosecutors in munich will seek extradition of 88-year-old demjanjuk from the united states , where he immigrated in the 1950s and worked in the car industry . ukrainian-born demjanjuk is accused of having having participated in the murder in 1943 of at least 29,000 european jews at the death camps in sobibor and treblinka , poland , during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan john demjanjuk arrives at the federal building in cleveland in 2005 " we have managed to obtain hundred of documents and have also found a number of witnesses who spoke out against demjanjuk , " schrimm told the reuters news agency . " for the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers .
we have no doubt that he is responsible for the death of over 29,000 jews , " schrimm added . us authorities extradited him to israel in 1986 after his alleged role in the holocaust became known in the 1970s . he was accused of crimes committed at the treblinka death camp , where survivors said he was given the nickname ivan the terrible for his alleged crimes . identity questions demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988 , but the israeli supreme court overturned the verdict in 1990 , saying that it could not be proven that he was the same person as ivan the terrible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews being sent to the treblinka death camp , where demjanjuk also worked as a guard now demjanjuk 's identity , schrimm said , has been " 100 percent " established . the german nazi hunters are now convinced that their investigation has brought new evidence about his activities in sobibor .
they said germany has jurisdiction because 1,900 jewish victims were german citizens . currently demjanjuk is stateless and ukraine refuses to take him back .
munich prosecutors are to be asked to take on the case because demjanjuk lived near there till moving to the united states in 1952 , where he changed his name to john . schrimm said the decision was up to the munich prosecutors .
his team had provided hundreds of pages of documentation from archives in israel , the united states and various sites in germany . the investigation office , which has faced criticism from israeli-based groups for not delivering results , celebrates its 50th anniversary on december 1 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .

anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .
1 in protest of russia 's military action in georgia .
but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .
the eu will stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations , " the statement said ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .

following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .
" i hope that i have not closed all doors because of one mistake , " he said .
" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .
but at the moment everything is fine the way it is . "
kuranyi , who has since had a telephone conversation with loew and apologized for his actions , said that he tried to explain why he left the stadium .
kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "
he added , however , that in principle he did not regret his actions .
" if i had not gone , i would not have learned many things that are important for my future .

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .
the price of shares in the group jumped by 8.82 percent to 10.18 euros in midday trading , while the dax index of leading shares had gained 3.17 percent overall . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany contributes to the nato rapid reaction force " nato could react with its rapid reaction force , " launched in 2003 , which allows the alliance to speedily deploy up to 25,000 troops anywhere , solaja said .
military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "
" the rs government has nothing against maintaining the military presence in bosnia , " he told reporters , adding , however , that it was time to remove the office of the international envoy in bosnia .

about 100 people were killed during the pogrom and about 30,000 jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps . 1923 : hitler putsch nazi leaders , including adolf hitler , had meanwhile gathered in munich to commemorate the 15th anniversary of another nov .

hitler 's march on munich took place exactly five years after the proclamation of the german republic by social democratic politician philipp scheidemann , which came just two days before the end of world war i. " many germans saw the parliamentary democracy not as a new beginning , but as a consequence of the lost war as well as an instrument of the victors , " winkler told german daily die welt , adding that right-wing supporters rejected the republic as " non-german .

but according to a 2008 opinion poll , an increasing number of germans also has trouble remembering that the event which did eventually lead to a unified and free germany took place on that date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , everyone 's free to pass through brandenburg gate asked " what happened on nov .

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .

but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .

" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany contributes to the nato rapid reaction force " nato could react with its rapid reaction force , " launched in 2003 , which allows the alliance to speedily deploy up to 25,000 troops anywhere , solaja said .

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eufor is still needed to stablize bosnia , according to some bosnia 's political scene has been hostile since 2006 elections propelled into office two key figures - haris silajdzic , the muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , and bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik .
dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany contributes to the nato rapid reaction force " nato could react with its rapid reaction force , " launched in 2003 , which allows the alliance to speedily deploy up to 25,000 troops anywhere , solaja said .
military analyst antonio prlenda said the " withdrawal of eufor would be justified by an operational point of view but , politically , it could turn out to be an error . "
dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .
" i hope that i have not closed all doors because of one mistake , " he said .
" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .
but at the moment everything is fine the way it is . "
kuranyi , who has since had a telephone conversation with loew and apologized for his actions , said that he tried to explain why he left the stadium .
kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "
he added , however , that in principle he did not regret his actions .
" if i had not gone , i would not have learned many things that are important for my future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 10.11.2008 rwanda angry at arrest in germany of presidential aide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kabuye was arrested at frankfurt airport german police have arrested rose kabuye , chief of protocol for rwandan president paul kagame .
she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .
" i hope that i have not closed all doors because of one mistake , " he said .
" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .

kuranyi , who has since had a telephone conversation with loew and apologized for his actions , said that he tried to explain why he left the stadium .
kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "
he added , however , that in principle he did not regret his actions .

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .
" the most important thing is that we formulate from anew the rules governing international finance , " lagarde said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .
the price of shares in the group jumped by 8.82 percent to 10.18 euros in midday trading , while the dax index of leading shares had gained 3.17 percent overall . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .
" i hope that i have not closed all doors because of one mistake , " he said .
" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .
but at the moment everything is fine the way it is . "
kuranyi , who has since had a telephone conversation with loew and apologized for his actions , said that he tried to explain why he left the stadium .
kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "
he added , however , that in principle he did not regret his actions .

i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .

international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .
" i hope that i have not closed all doors because of one mistake , " he said .
" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .
but at the moment everything is fine the way it is . "
kuranyi , who has since had a telephone conversation with loew and apologized for his actions , said that he tried to explain why he left the stadium .
kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "
he added , however , that in principle he did not regret his actions .

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .
world credit markets have cramped up in the wake of a soured us mortgage market .

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .
1 in protest of russia 's military action in georgia .
but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .
the eu will stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations , " the statement said ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
breakdown of talks after georgia war on sept .
1 , following russia 's occupation of parts of georgia , eu leaders at an emergency summit decided to postpone talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement " until russian troops pulled back to the lines they occupied before the war broke out on aug .
7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has 200 observers stationed in georgia the new agreement is meant to replace a partnership and cooperation agreement signed in 1997 , and is intended to give a legal basis to eu-russia relations on everything from energy to culture .
following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .
" the choice is very clear : do we want to bilateralize our relations with russia or do we want to have a clear eu-russia policy ? "

but according to a report made available to the associated press , they said it would be replaced by a strengthened eu presence that would monitor and encourage reforms in bosnia .
eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...
i am afraid that it is too risky .
it could be very dangerous for peace , " bosnian muslim leader sulejman tihic told reporters .

dodik has warned that the serbs ' republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , which along with the muslim-croat federation makes up post-war bosnia , could secede .
meanwhile , silajdzic has called for rs to be abolished .
new conflict " unlikely " say analysts political analyst milos solaja estimated it would be " very difficult " for a new war to break out in bosnia .
" today there is neither the will nor enough arms to have a war in the country ...
i believe that political leaders know that it would not contribute to anyone , " he told reporters .
but he warned of a repeat of the 1990s , when decisive international intervention was awaited for three and a half years to end the war which claimed some 100,000 lives .

dodik said bosnia was " stable " and that the war " belongs irrevocably to the past . "

eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .
it currently has 2,125 troops from 26 countries , of which 21 are members of the european bloc .
spain provides the largest contingent with 376 soldiers , followed by italy 's 248 , turkey 's 242 and poland 's 204 .
the european union had been hoping to wind down its bosnia military mission , but simmering political instability in the balkan country has forced it to reconsider , a decision that 's been welcomed by some bosnian leaders .
" the withdrawal of eufor represents a danger ...

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .
1 in protest of russia 's military action in georgia .
but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .
the eu will stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations , " the statement said ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
breakdown of talks after georgia war on sept .
1 , following russia 's occupation of parts of georgia , eu leaders at an emergency summit decided to postpone talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement " until russian troops pulled back to the lines they occupied before the war broke out on aug .
7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has 200 observers stationed in georgia the new agreement is meant to replace a partnership and cooperation agreement signed in 1997 , and is intended to give a legal basis to eu-russia relations on everything from energy to culture .
following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .
" the choice is very clear : do we want to bilateralize our relations with russia or do we want to have a clear eu-russia policy ? "

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .
1 in protest of russia 's military action in georgia .
but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .
the eu will stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations , " the statement said ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
breakdown of talks after georgia war on sept .
1 , following russia 's occupation of parts of georgia , eu leaders at an emergency summit decided to postpone talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement " until russian troops pulled back to the lines they occupied before the war broke out on aug .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has 200 observers stationed in georgia the new agreement is meant to replace a partnership and cooperation agreement signed in 1997 , and is intended to give a legal basis to eu-russia relations on everything from energy to culture .
following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .
" the choice is very clear : do we want to bilateralize our relations with russia or do we want to have a clear eu-russia policy ? "

elsewhere , wiring and signal gear along german railway lines were set on fire .
though most of the attacks were anonymous , police said it was likely the sabotage was the work of anti-nuclear militants .
by early sunday afternoon , the train , loaded with 17 tons of waste pellets encapsulated in 100 tons of insulating glass , had reached goettingen in central germany .
to the north , at hitzacker , close to the waste warehouse , protesters defied a ban on demonstrations near the railway and invaded the line .
some tried to damage it , a police spokesman said .
riot police using batons dispersed the crowd back into nearby woods .
protesters set fire to bales of straw on the rails , which were extinguished by police water-cannon .

at gorleben many tons of radioactive waste have been accumulated from german power stations after being sealed into glass pellets at a factory in france .
berlin plans to dump the waste long-term in an old salt-mine .
the anti-nuclear movement seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations and has been upset at debate in germany about extending the stations ' operation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming .
the issue has intensified in germany after revelations that another salt-mine dump , near wolfenbuettel , has developed leaks and cracks .
on saturday , the freight train was delayed for about 12 hours by three militants who chained themselves to a lump of concrete under a track near the french border .
police had to carefully dismantle the concrete to detach the trio , delaying the entire transport operation . dw staff -lrb- nda / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .
1 in protest of russia 's military action in georgia .
but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .
the eu will stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations , " the statement said ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
breakdown of talks after georgia war on sept .
1 , following russia 's occupation of parts of georgia , eu leaders at an emergency summit decided to postpone talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement " until russian troops pulled back to the lines they occupied before the war broke out on aug .
7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has 200 observers stationed in georgia the new agreement is meant to replace a partnership and cooperation agreement signed in 1997 , and is intended to give a legal basis to eu-russia relations on everything from energy to culture .
following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .
" the choice is very clear : do we want to bilateralize our relations with russia or do we want to have a clear eu-russia policy ? "

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is sought for questioning by a french judge on the background to the country 's genocide in 1994 . rose kabuye , the rwandan director general of state protocol , was detained at frankfurt airport on sunday , nov .
9 , on the basis of an international arrest warrant .
" i can confirm she has been detained , " a spokesman said .
" german justice authorities will be responsible for the next step . "
he said he had no further details .
lef forster , kabuye 's lawyer , told ap news agency in paris that kabuye had agreed to be extradited to france , where she was expected to arrive in a few days for questioning about the 1994 attack on the plane of former rwandan president juvenal habyarimana .
plane crash was the last straw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500,000 tutsis and politically moderate hutus were killed in the rwandan genocide in 2006 , france issued arrest warrants over the crash for nine of president kagame 's associates , including kabuye , prompting rwanda to break off diplomatic ties with paris .
after the hutu leader 's aircraft was mysteriously hit by a missile , his death triggered the genocide in the central african nation of about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus .
kagame was then leader of the rwandan patriotic front , which defeated the habyarimana government 's hutu militias to end the genocide .
though rwanda was a belgian colony until its independence in 1962 , france kept close links with the francophone nation from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
france sent troops to rwanda at the height of the genocide under a un-authorized operation , saying it was safeguarding the provision of food and emergency medical services .
president has diplomatic immunity under french law , a warrant can not be issued for kagame because , as head-of-state , he has immunity .
in april this year , kagame made a four-day state visit to germany , reported reuters news agency .
kabuye was allegedly among the party , but german law prohibits the detention of any members of an official delegation .
rwandan information minister louise mushikiwabo said sunday the arrest in germany was " improper . "
" we immediately sent a protest note -lrb- to the german embassy in kigali -rrb- ... we emphasized that rose kabuye holds a diplomatic passport ... therefore the german government should n't have arrested her , " foreign minister rosemary museminali told reporters late on sunday .
in a statement , rwanda 's information ministry said the arrests were a " political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government , " reported reuters .
kabuye had been warned against going to germany due to the arrest warrants , but she had traveled there and to other european countries earlier in the year without incident , the statement explained .
" kabuye is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in france , " it said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

43 sobibor , " the date he allegedly began work in the death camp german investigators handed over monday what they said was adequate evidence to try a former ukrainian , ivan john demjanjuk , for nazi war crimes .
he was a former death camp guard now living in the us . the file on demjanjuk , who was nicknamed " ivan the terrible , " was compiled by the german national office for solving nazi crimes . the head of the office , kurt schrimm , said he hopes the prosecutors in munich will seek extradition of 88-year-old demjanjuk from the united states , where he immigrated in the 1950s and worked in the car industry . ukrainian-born demjanjuk is accused of having having participated in the murder in 1943 of at least 29,000 european jews at the death camps in sobibor and treblinka , poland , during world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan john demjanjuk arrives at the federal building in cleveland in 2005 " we have managed to obtain hundred of documents and have also found a number of witnesses who spoke out against demjanjuk , " schrimm told the reuters news agency . " for the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers .
we have no doubt that he is responsible for the death of over 29,000 jews , " schrimm added . us authorities extradited him to israel in 1986 after his alleged role in the holocaust became known in the 1970s . he was accused of crimes committed at the treblinka death camp , where survivors said he was given the nickname ivan the terrible for his alleged crimes . identity questions demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988 , but the israeli supreme court overturned the verdict in 1990 , saying that it could not be proven that he was the same person as ivan the terrible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews being sent to the treblinka death camp , where demjanjuk also worked as a guard now demjanjuk 's identity , schrimm said , has been " 100 percent " established . the german nazi hunters are now convinced that their investigation has brought new evidence about his activities in sobibor .
they said germany has jurisdiction because 1,900 jewish victims were german citizens . currently demjanjuk is stateless and ukraine refuses to take him back .
munich prosecutors are to be asked to take on the case because demjanjuk lived near there till moving to the united states in 1952 , where he changed his name to john . schrimm said the decision was up to the munich prosecutors .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "

" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .
1 in protest of russia 's military action in georgia .
but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .
the eu will stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations , " the statement said ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
breakdown of talks after georgia war on sept .
1 , following russia 's occupation of parts of georgia , eu leaders at an emergency summit decided to postpone talks on the so-called " new eu-russia agreement " until russian troops pulled back to the lines they occupied before the war broke out on aug .
7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has 200 observers stationed in georgia the new agreement is meant to replace a partnership and cooperation agreement signed in 1997 , and is intended to give a legal basis to eu-russia relations on everything from energy to culture .
following the september summit , russia pulled its troops out of most , but not all , parts of georgia .
" russia has not yet withdrawn to its pre-aug .
7 positions as the eu has made clear that it must , " the british-swedish paper said .
nonetheless , in recent weeks the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and the bloc 's executive , the european commission , called for a new start to the talks .
" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .
but a number of eu states had warned that any further halt in talks would fragment the bloc , leaving member states free to cut their own deals with moscow .
" the choice is very clear : do we want to bilateralize our relations with russia or do we want to have a clear eu-russia policy ? "

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .
" you ca n't just apply obama 's success to germany 's history of immigration . "
the question of whether or not germany is ready for a leader with an immigrant background will be discussed when there are more parliamentarians in the bundestag of non-german origin , she said .
demirbueken-wegner added that she is confident that more people from germany 's immigrant minorities will get involved in politics , but warned that it 's a process that should not be hurried . juelide danisman -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have found a good way to proceed , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner after discussions among eu foreign ministers in brussels .
the meeting on monday was aimed at settling differences ahead of an eu-russia meeting in nice , in southern france , on friday .
poland and lithuania , formerly in the soviet union 's sphere of influence , had been firmly against any resumption of talks .
poland dropped its objections , although lithuania remains opposed to starting the talks .
the talks had been frozen on sept .

but since the european commission has a mandate to resume the negotiations , it did not require all 27 eu members states to move forward .
britain and sweden get on board britain and sweden , which had been opposed to new negotiations , dropped their objections .
" while noting that a strategic partnership with russia based on common values is not in place as of today , we can support resuming negotiations ... because we believe that the issues that will be covered are in the eu 's interests as well as russia 's , " the two countries ' foreign ministers said in a statement .
" we are not returning to business as usual , nor are we turning the page on the conflict in georgia .

" these negotiations should continue , first because this would allow the eu to pursue its own interests with russia , and secondly because this is the best way to engage with russia on the basis of a unified position , " the commission said in a report on wednesday .
lithuania and poland , who feel targeted by a russian threat to site missiles in its baltic exclave of kaliningrad , had criticized that call , saying it rewarded russia 's occupation of georgia .

barack obama 's election victory in the united states has many germans asking if a politician with an immigrant background could one day be elected chancellor of germany . could germany have its own barack obama in the future ?
according to a recent poll , not any day soon .
a forsa survey published over the weekend concluded that 58 percent of germans feel the country is not yet ready to elect someone with an immigrant background to the office of chancellor , while 39 percent said they could imagine having a head of state with foreign roots .
some german politicians from immigrant families , however , are among the more pessimistic voices on this issue .
turkish-born ozcan mutlu , a spokesperson for education and migration policies for the green party in the berlin house of representatives since 1999 , said germany is nowhere close to electing a candidate like obama .
" it would be very good for germany , because it would reflect the ethnic diversity of this country on the level of government , but germany is far , far away from such a reality , " mutlu said .
" our country does n't have the kind of civil rights history like the united states , for example .
and immigrants in germany have not brought forward anyone like obama from their own ranks , so i think we 're far from reaching such a goal . "
germany has a different history social democrat parliamentarian josip juratovic is more confident that a german obama is in the cards , if only because now almost 40 percent of the german population is of non-german origin .
" we now have many parliamentarians with non-german backgrounds , so why should n't it be possible ? " said the 49-year-old , who was born in croatia .
" but just as barack obama sees himself as the president of all americans , it 's important that they see themselves are representatives of all german citizens . "
other politicians of non-german origin argue that the situation in germany can not be compared with that in the united states .
" america has a totally different history , " said emine demirbueken-wegner , a member of the berlin house of representatives who moved to germany in 1969 from her native turkey .

that 's on top of another 4,500 job cuts that had already been announced . the move is part of post 's attempted restructuring of dhl which will also involve shutting down the domestic air and ground operations of the us subsidiary .
dhl , which competes with rivals ups and fedex , has been a perennial loss-maker for deutsche post since former post chief klaus zumwinkel , who was recently charged with tax fraud , decided to push into the us market .
the bonn-based company had already announced it would cut 4,500 jobs , a decision likely to affect drivers , shipping clerks and warehouse workers .
the streamlining of dhl would cost about $ 3.9 billion -lrb- three billion euros -rrb- , post said in a statement , adding that operating costs at dhl 's express unit would drop from $ 5.4 billion to less than one billion dollars .
the express unit employs around 18,000 people .
the group " will focus its express business in the us on its core international competencies and exit the domestic air and ground express service in the country by the end of january , " the statement said .
" the international express offering in the us will be maintained on today 's levels and the region will remain an integral part of dhl 's global express network , " it added .
deutsche post , owned 31 percent by the german government , said it would likely see a net loss for 2008 .
but the logistics giant said its nine-month core earnings had gained 1.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros , on sales that rose by 2.3 percent to 40.5 billion euros .
the price of shares in the group jumped by 8.82 percent to 10.18 euros in midday trading , while the dax index of leading shares had gained 3.17 percent overall . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu defense ministers reviewed the fate of the eu 's military mission in bosnia - eufor - on monday , though they were expected to maintain the force until there is a return to political stability .
the european union launched its althea peacekeeping mission in bosnia with a military force of 7,000 in 2004 to oversee the dayton accords that ended the 1992-1995 war .

it said it was making the appeal with four other rights groups in the expectation that the next us president , barack obama , would close the detention center in cuba .
about 250 people accused of being terrorists are currently held at the camp .
some 80 are expected to face trial by court martial .
amnesty said the remainder included 50 from nations such as china , libya , russia , tunisia and uzbekistan .
the human-rights groups made their call after a two-day workshop in berlin .
" guantanamo can not be closed until these men have a country which will accept them , and where their lives and liberty are not in jeopardy , " the statement said .
obama to move guantanamo issue forward separately , advisers to president-elect barack obama have said they were putting together a proposal to ship dozens of the imprisoned terrorism suspects to the us to face criminal trial .
under the plans , some detainees would be released and others would face prosecution .
the resolution of the issues surrounding guantanamo bay may require the creation of a new system of justice designed to handle sensitive national-security cases , the advisers said .
if the proposal is carried through it would make good on obama 's election campaign pledge to close the controversial detention facility . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi was quoted in the weekly welt am sonntag as having said that he is hoping for another chance .

" some time in the future it will be my goal again to play for germany .

kuranyi feels misunderstood " i told loew that the manner in which i departed was wrong .
i tried to explain why i undertook a step that nobody expected me to do , not even my father .
" the problem , however , is that it is very difficult to understand for others .
nobody felt at the time how i felt . "
kuranyi admitted that he would act differently in a similar situation .
" i think i would go to him and say : i am leaving .
i did not do that a month ago and that was wrong . "

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .
" the solution to this crisis must be rapid , " brazilian finance minister guido mantega told reporters .
" we need to change the tire on the car while it 's still moving . "
a stronger voice for developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sao paulo meeting laid the basis for a conference in washington later this week brazil , russia , india and china plan coordinated measures to increase trade and capital flows among their economies , russian finance minister alexei kudrin told bloomberg .
mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .

it said it was making the appeal with four other rights groups in the expectation that the next us president , barack obama , would close the detention center in cuba .
about 250 people accused of being terrorists are currently held at the camp .
some 80 are expected to face trial by court martial .
amnesty said the remainder included 50 from nations such as china , libya , russia , tunisia and uzbekistan .
the human-rights groups made their call after a two-day workshop in berlin .
" guantanamo can not be closed until these men have a country which will accept them , and where their lives and liberty are not in jeopardy , " the statement said .
obama to move guantanamo issue forward separately , advisers to president-elect barack obama have said they were putting together a proposal to ship dozens of the imprisoned terrorism suspects to the us to face criminal trial .
under the plans , some detainees would be released and others would face prosecution .
the resolution of the issues surrounding guantanamo bay may require the creation of a new system of justice designed to handle sensitive national-security cases , the advisers said .
if the proposal is carried through it would make good on obama 's election campaign pledge to close the controversial detention facility . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a report in the brazilian newspaper o globo , eu leaders , after a day of meeting behind closed doors in brazil 's commercial capital sao paulo , agreed that gaining greater influence requires providing more resources to solve problems .
" in the opinion of the eu , whoever wants more say must also bring a larger financial offering to the table .
there are no free rides , " german finance secretary joerg asmussen was quoted as saying .
the g20 talks in brazil included finance ministers and central bank chiefs , who met to lay the basis for the summit of g20 leaders in washington .
in a final statement on sunday , the group of 20 said it was prepared to act " urgently " to bolster growth and called on governments to cut interest rates and raise spending .
" we stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth , " the group said .
" countries must use all their policy flexibility , consistent with their circumstances , to support sustainable growth . "
the measures should include " monetary and fiscal policy , " the statement said , according to the bloomberg financial news service .

mexican deputy finance minister alejandro werner said that slower economic growth and lower food and commodity prices justify cutting interest rates .
mantega warned that emerging economies are tired of appearing at meetings with industrialized countries only to be allowed to " drink coffee . "
in the future , it will be increasingly difficult for industrialized countries to exclude emerging and developing economies from a meaningful participation in international decisions , he said .
french finance minister christine lagarde emphasized that the g20 agreed that an expansive monetary and investment program were necessary to finding the way out of the financial crisis .

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly the situation is in decline , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the eu ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
" the humanitarian situation is more than disastrous , difficult to accept . "
" will the un forces be able to deal with -lrb- the crisis -rrb- ?
i do n't know , " kouchner added as he arrived to chair a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu meeting followed fresh fighting in dr congo on sunday , forcing thousands of people to flee bordering nord-kivu and sud-kivu provinces .
no eu involvement , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurent nkunda has called for direct dialog with dr congo 's president but european ministers remained adamant the time was not right to send eu peacekeeping troops into eastern dr congo .
german defense minister franz joseph jung insisted it was " out of the question for the moment , " while british foreign secretary david miliband insisted the un needed more time to weight up the situation .
" we should wait for the assessment by the un investigator … and then it will be for every country of the world to consider its own position , " miliband said .
southern african nations , meanwhile , said they were prepared to send peacekeepers into the conflict zone to stem a humanitarian crisis that has been escalating since fighting erupted in august .
an estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a result .
anti-piracy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recreational and commercial shipping off somalia has been severely affected by piracy there but the conflict in dr congo was not the only focus at the brussels meeting , with eu ministers also signing off on a plan to send a fleet of frigates and spotter aircraft to waters off somalia to combat rampant piracy there .
tagged " operation atalanta , " the force will comprise at least seven ships , including three frigates , a supply vessel and surveillance aircraft to be deployed to waters around the horn of africa around mid-december , officials said .
the mission will be commanded from the british naval base of northwood , north of london , and has been tasked with protecting merchant ships and aiding vessels bound for the somali port of mogadishu .
" some of the food -lrb- aid -rrb- that will have to go to somalia will be protected by the mission , " the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , said .
international attention has focused sharply on piracy in waters off somalia in recent months following a spate of attacks and kidnappings and the capture of a ukrainian ship laden with heavy weaponry .
the international maritime bureau , a watchdog group , estimated that somali pirates were responsible for around one-third of all reported attacks on ships .
appeal to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi eu ministers also used monday ’ s meeting to urge china to work more closely with the 27-nation bloc to boost development and stability in africa .
both the eu and china play a growing role in africa , and " in this new context , it would seem advantageous to coordinate the eu 's and china 's efforts more closely around priorities which reflect africa 's needs , " a statement from the ministers said .
" particular attention should be given to cooperation in the area of peace and security , " it said .
over the last 18 months , eu officials have expressed increasing concern at china 's rapprochement with african states such as sudan and angola , warning that this undermines european attempts to build democracy and stability across the continent .
the brussels meeting also looked at the faltering progress of democracy in myanmar .
european ministers said the eu was ready to toughen sanctions on the isolated country ’ s military junta unless it showed signs of a genuine transition to democracy . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also target those not wearing seat belts and aims to educate offenders about the dangers .
but if they are spotted , offenders will be given the chance to avoid paying a fine by watching a 10-minute safety lecture at a nearby fire station .
officers will be positioned in areas with high crash levels .
the action is part of road safety week involving all three emergency services .
if drivers are stopped by police , they can agree to pay a £ 30 fine if they are not wearing a seat belt .
the mobile phone user can agree to accept three penalty points on their licence and pay a £ 60 fine .
otherwise , they can attend the fire station , which will be nearby , to see a 10-minute presentation on the consequences of distractions at the wheel and not wearing a seat belt .
dangers at home and on the road in south wales : homes fires : 2007 - 1,056 ; 2008 - 722 deaths : 2007 - 6 ; 2008 - 5 injuries : 2007 - 95 ; 2008 - 45 roads collisions : 2007 - 1318 ; 2008 - 1237 extrications : 2007 - 280 ; 2008 - 217 deaths : 2007 - 18 ; 2008 - 19 injuries : 2007 - 554 ; 2008 - 533 source : south wales fire and rescue service chief fire officer andy marles from south wales fire and rescue service said their role in educating people in safe driving was becoming more important .
" firefighters in south wales attend thousands of road traffic collisions every year and witness some of the dreadful consequences of simple mistakes made every day by people behind the wheel , " he said .
" we hope that this week we can make a difference by working with our colleagues in the other emergency services .
" hopefully we 'll get to people to change their ways , before our firefighters have to deal with them in a real road crash . "
gerry wilson , the area ambulance officer for cardiff , urged motorists to watch their speed and concentrate solely on driving when out on the roads .
' lapse in concentration ' " it only takes a momentary lapse in concentration to destroy somebody 's life , and tear a family apart , " he said .
south wales police 's road safety manager wayne tucker said he thought more people would choose to watch the video than be fined in the operation .
" the video should make people question their actions when getting into their vehicle , and realise what awful consequences can result from simple decisions they make , " he said .
in the latest national framework for fire and rescue services issued by the welsh assembly government , it states that each service must work in partnership with relevant agencies to reduce death and injury on the road .
road safety week is run by the charity brake .

john podesta said executive orders by president george w bush on issues such as stem cell research and oil drilling were at odds with mr obama 's views .
plans to pass a raft of last-minute regulations are also being watched .
on monday mr obama and mr bush will hold their first meeting since the democrat 's election victory .
mr obama and his wife , michelle , will be given a tour of their new home at the white house .
afterwards the president-elect and mr bush are expected to hold what mr obama has described as " substantive talks " .
' deliberate haste ' the meeting has been arranged with unusual haste - analysts say this is in part because the us is at war , and also the transition is taking place in the midst of an economic crisis .
mr obama has said that dealing with the economy is his top priority , and that he will move with " deliberate haste " to choose his cabinet .
you see the bush administration even today moving aggressively to do things i think are not in the interest of the country john podesta speaking on fox news , mr podesta said mr obama 's team was working hard to " build up that core economic team " .
speaking on friday in his first news conference as president-elect , mr obama said he would seek a constructive approach to the meeting with mr bush .
" i 'm not going to anticipate problems .
i 'm going to go in there with a spirit of bipartisanship , " he said .
however , reports from washington suggest mr obama 's transition team has been working hard to identify issues where executive decisions made by mr bush could be quickly repealed by mr obama .
the washington post reported that transition officials had compiled a list of some 200 executive orders to be considered for repeal .
mr podesta said executive orders on stem cell research or drilling in utah could be easily repealed as no congressional action was needed .
in 2001 , mr bush issued an executive order limiting federal funding for medical research using human embryo stem cells .
the move was popular with moral conservatives but critics say it has hampered us medical research efforts .
bush decisions under fire limited federal funding for medical research using human embryo stem cells aid groups receiving us aid barred from counselling women about abortion availability california barred from imposing minimum standards of vehicle fuel efficiency utah land being opened up for oil and gas drilling mr podesta highlighted the bush administration 's attempts to authorise oil and gas drilling in utah as one order which could be easily repealed .
the washington post said other orders affecting environmental legislation and abortion issues were also under consideration .
" -lsb- obama is -rsb- a transformational figure , and i think he 's going to transform the way government acts as we move forward , " mr podesta said .
last-minute concerns potential plans for a last-minute rush of executive decisions by the white house were also being watched carefully , mr podesta said .
" you see the bush administration even today moving aggressively to do things i think are not in the interest of the country , " he added .
the current administration has proposed a number of regulation changes they hope can be approved before mr obama 's team moves into the white house .
critics say many of the proposals would weaken environmental and consumer protection as well as reduce controls on drilling and mining companies .
bush white house officials deny the plans are being rushed through , while critics suggest the proposals could be difficult for mr obama 's administration to undo , calling them an " assault on the public " .
the co-chair of mr obama 's transition team , valerie jarrett , said the new president was aiming to assemble a diverse , bipartisan cabinet .
" i 'm confident his administration will include people from all perspectives , " she said .
mr bush 's chief of staff , josh bolten , has pledged a smooth transition .
" if a crisis hits on january 21 , they 're the ones who are going to have to deal with it .
we need to make sure that they 're as well prepared as possible , " mr bolten said .

in 2001 , mr bush issued an executive order limiting federal funding for medical research using human embryo stem cells .
the move was popular with moral conservatives but critics say it has hampered us medical research efforts .
bush decisions under fire limited federal funding for medical research using human embryo stem cells aid groups receiving us aid barred from counselling women about abortion availability california barred from imposing minimum standards of vehicle fuel efficiency utah land being opened up for oil and gas drilling mr podesta highlighted the bush administration 's attempts to authorise oil and gas drilling in utah as one order which could be easily repealed .
the washington post said other orders affecting environmental legislation and abortion issues were also under consideration .
" -lsb- obama is -rsb- a transformational figure , and i think he 's going to transform the way government acts as we move forward , " mr podesta said .
last-minute concerns potential plans for a last-minute rush of executive decisions by the white house were also being watched carefully , mr podesta said .
" you see the bush administration even today moving aggressively to do things i think are not in the interest of the country , " he added .
the current administration has proposed a number of regulation changes they hope can be approved before mr obama 's team moves into the white house .
critics say many of the proposals would weaken environmental and consumer protection as well as reduce controls on drilling and mining companies .
bush white house officials deny the plans are being rushed through , while critics suggest the proposals could be difficult for mr obama 's administration to undo , calling them an " assault on the public " .
the co-chair of mr obama 's transition team , valerie jarrett , said the new president was aiming to assemble a diverse , bipartisan cabinet .
" i 'm confident his administration will include people from all perspectives , " she said .
mr bush 's chief of staff , josh bolten , has pledged a smooth transition .
" if a crisis hits on january 21 , they 're the ones who are going to have to deal with it .
we need to make sure that they 're as well prepared as possible , " mr bolten said .

john podesta said executive orders by president george w bush on issues such as stem cell research and oil drilling were at odds with mr obama 's views .
plans to pass a raft of last-minute regulations are also being watched .
on monday mr obama and mr bush will hold their first meeting since the democrat 's election victory .
mr obama and his wife , michelle , will be given a tour of their new home at the white house .
afterwards the president-elect and mr bush are expected to hold what mr obama has described as " substantive talks " .
' deliberate haste ' the meeting has been arranged with unusual haste - analysts say this is in part because the us is at war , and also the transition is taking place in the midst of an economic crisis .
mr obama has said that dealing with the economy is his top priority , and that he will move with " deliberate haste " to choose his cabinet . "
you see the bush administration even today moving aggressively to do things i think are not in the interest of the country " john podesta speaking on fox news , mr podesta said mr obama 's team was working hard to " build up that core economic team " .
speaking on friday in his first news conference as president-elect , mr obama said he would seek a constructive approach to the meeting with mr bush .
" i 'm not going to anticipate problems .
i 'm going to go in there with a spirit of bipartisanship , " he said .
however , reports from washington suggest mr obama 's transition team has been working hard to identify issues where executive decisions made by mr bush could be quickly repealed by mr obama .
the washington post reported that transition officials had compiled a list of some 200 executive orders to be considered for repeal .
mr podesta said executive orders on stem cell research or drilling in utah could be easily repealed as no congressional action was needed .

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement revellers in torquay on the new measures with politicians calling for a crackdown on alcohol-fuelled disorder , police in torquay have come up with a solution to one of the more anti-social aspects of drinking far too much .
you would expect a police van to be well equipped - handcuffs , truncheons , helmets and armour .
but what about a mop and bucket ?
i found myself hurtling down torquay 's palmed-fringed seafront with a local patrol - who can only really be described as the " mop cops " .
police in the devon resort have decided to clean up their town , quite literally .
for the last few months anyone caught peeing in the streets after one too many drinks on the town will be given a choice : either face arrest for being drunk and disorderly , or take a mop and bucket and clean up your own mess .
but as the finer details of this unusual campaign were being explained to me in the back of the police van , we pulled up abruptly .
punishment we had been on patrol for all of two minutes and they had already caught their first piddler , red-handed .
he was just a teenager , clearly under the influence and shocked at all the unwanted attention .
presented with his choice , he did not take long to decide .
moments later , his head bowed , his face hidden by his hooded top , he was hunched over his own trail of wee , mopping away .
i asked him if he accepted the punishment - and he gruffly replied " yeah " .
he was clearly not enjoying this , as his friends watched and laughed .
but he was soon on his way after a ticking-off from sgt nick healy .
the boy assured him he would n't do it again .
the idea was the brainchild of supt chris singer , who calls this approach to policing " restorative justice " .
" people need to take responsibility for their actions " , he said .
people need to take responsibility for their actions supt chris singer i asked him if this was n't just primitive policing , akin to wiping a puppy 's nose in its own mess ?
it 's not a comparison he shared .
" no , it is n't at all .
it is a simple and straightforward approach .
" there is a hygiene element to all of this .
urine is left in a doorway for somebody else to clear up - why should somebody else clear it up ?
" we 're saying , you 've committed an offence , now please clear it up . "
while we were filming , someone else relieved themselves down a hidden alleyway .
this time it is just a ticking off ; the mop and bucket are left in the van .
but his excuse ?
" well , if there was n't such a long queue in the club , i would n't have done it . "
' lucky ' others differ .
speak to anyone on the street on a busy friday night and the vast majority will tell you urinating in public is unacceptable .
it 's a view echoed by local businessmen who , the morning after the night before , have to clear up after a heavy night .
one restaurateur complained of how a reveller urinated against his restaurant window , while diners would be eating .
but back on the busy streets of torquay , the night was winding down .
the police packed up their kit and the mop was put away for now .
and as we made our way back home , one officer confided in me .
perhaps those made to use the mop should count themselves lucky - he told me that there was a time when anyone caught peeing in the streets would have been made to clear it up with their own shirts .

advertisement revellers in torquay on the new measures with politicians calling for a crackdown on alcohol-fuelled disorder , police in torquay have come up with a solution to one of the more anti-social aspects of drinking far too much .
you would expect a police van to be well equipped - handcuffs , truncheons , helmets and armour .
but what about a mop and bucket ?
i found myself hurtling down torquay 's palmed-fringed seafront with a local patrol - who can only really be described as the " mop cops " .
police in the devon resort have decided to clean up their town , quite literally .
for the last few months anyone caught peeing in the streets after one too many drinks on the town will be given a choice : either face arrest for being drunk and disorderly , or take a mop and bucket and clean up your own mess .
but as the finer details of this unusual campaign were being explained to me in the back of the police van , we pulled up abruptly .
punishment we had been on patrol for all of two minutes and they had already caught their first piddler , red-handed .
he was just a teenager , clearly under the influence and shocked at all the unwanted attention .
presented with his choice , he did not take long to decide .
moments later , his head bowed , his face hidden by his hooded top , he was hunched over his own trail of wee , mopping away .
i asked him if he accepted the punishment - and he gruffly replied " yeah " .
he was clearly not enjoying this , as his friends watched and laughed .
but he was soon on his way after a ticking-off from sgt nick healy .
the boy assured him he would n't do it again .
the idea was the brainchild of supt chris singer , who calls this approach to policing " restorative justice " .
" people need to take responsibility for their actions " , he said .
people need to take responsibility for their actions supt chris singer i asked him if this was n't just primitive policing , akin to wiping a puppy 's nose in its own mess ?
it 's not a comparison he shared .
" no , it is n't at all .
it is a simple and straightforward approach .
" there is a hygiene element to all of this .
urine is left in a doorway for somebody else to clear up - why should somebody else clear it up ?
" we 're saying , you 've committed an offence , now please clear it up . "
while we were filming , someone else relieved themselves down a hidden alleyway .
this time it is just a ticking off ; the mop and bucket are left in the van .
but his excuse ?
" well , if there was n't such a long queue in the club , i would n't have done it . "
' lucky ' others differ .
speak to anyone on the street on a busy friday night and the vast majority will tell you urinating in public is unacceptable .
it 's a view echoed by local businessmen who , the morning after the night before , have to clear up after a heavy night .
one restaurateur complained of how a reveller urinated against his restaurant window , while diners would be eating .
but back on the busy streets of torquay , the night was winding down .
the police packed up their kit and the mop was put away for now .
and as we made our way back home , one officer confided in me .
perhaps those made to use the mop should count themselves lucky - he told me that there was a time when anyone caught peeing in the streets would have been made to clear it up with their own shirts .

advertisement revellers in torquay on the new measures with politicians calling for a crackdown on alcohol-fuelled disorder , police in torquay have come up with a solution to one of the more anti-social aspects of drinking far too much .
you would expect a police van to be well equipped - handcuffs , truncheons , helmets and armour .
but what about a mop and bucket ?
i found myself hurtling down torquay 's palmed-fringed seafront with a local patrol - who can only really be described as the " mop cops " .
police in the devon resort have decided to clean up their town , quite literally .
for the last few months anyone caught peeing in the streets after one too many drinks on the town will be given a choice : either face arrest for being drunk and disorderly , or take a mop and bucket and clean up your own mess .
but as the finer details of this unusual campaign were being explained to me in the back of the police van , we pulled up abruptly .
punishment we had been on patrol for all of two minutes and they had already caught their first piddler , red-handed .
he was just a teenager , clearly under the influence and shocked at all the unwanted attention .
presented with his choice , he did not take long to decide .
moments later , his head bowed , his face hidden by his hooded top , he was hunched over his own trail of wee , mopping away .
i asked him if he accepted the punishment - and he gruffly replied " yeah " .
he was clearly not enjoying this , as his friends watched and laughed .
but he was soon on his way after a ticking-off from sgt nick healy .

you would expect a police van to be well equipped - handcuffs , truncheons , helmets and armour .
but what about a mop and bucket ?
i found myself hurtling down torquay 's palmed-fringed seafront with a local patrol - who can only really be described as the " mop cops " .
police in the devon resort have decided to clean up their town , quite literally .
for the last few months anyone caught peeing in the streets after one too many drinks on the town will be given a choice : either face arrest for being drunk and disorderly , or take a mop and bucket and clean up your own mess .
but as the finer details of this unusual campaign were being explained to me in the back of the police van , we pulled up abruptly .
punishment we had been on patrol for all of two minutes and they had already caught their first piddler , red-handed .
he was just a teenager , clearly under the influence and shocked at all the unwanted attention .
presented with his choice , he did not take long to decide .
moments later , his head bowed , his face hidden by his hooded top , he was hunched over his own trail of wee , mopping away .
i asked him if he accepted the punishment - and he gruffly replied " yeah " .
he was clearly not enjoying this , as his friends watched and laughed .
but he was soon on his way after a ticking-off from sgt nick healy .
the boy assured him he would n't do it again .
the idea was the brainchild of supt chris singer , who calls this approach to policing " restorative justice " .
" people need to take responsibility for their actions " , he said . "
people need to take responsibility for their actions " supt chris singer i asked him if this was n't just primitive policing , akin to wiping a puppy 's nose in its own mess ?
it 's not a comparison he shared .
" no , it is n't at all .
it is a simple and straightforward approach .
" there is a hygiene element to all of this .
urine is left in a doorway for somebody else to clear up - why should somebody else clear it up ?
" we 're saying , you 've committed an offence , now please clear it up . "
while we were filming , someone else relieved themselves down a hidden alleyway .
this time it is just a ticking off ; the mop and bucket are left in the van .
but his excuse ?
" well , if there was n't such a long queue in the club , i would n't have done it . "
' lucky ' others differ .
speak to anyone on the street on a busy friday night and the vast majority will tell you urinating in public is unacceptable .
it 's a view echoed by local businessmen who , the morning after the night before , have to clear up after a heavy night .
one restaurateur complained of how a reveller urinated against his restaurant window , while diners would be eating .
but back on the busy streets of torquay , the night was winding down .
the police packed up their kit and the mop was put away for now .
and as we made our way back home , one officer confided in me .
perhaps those made to use the mop should count themselves lucky - he told me that there was a time when anyone caught peeing in the streets would have been made to clear it up with their own shirts .

comparative genomic hybridisation -lrb- cgh -rrb- enables doctors to scrutinise an embryo 's chromosomes for abnormalities more closely than ever before .
the american society of reproductive medicine heard that implantation rates using cgh were 62 % - around twice that achieved by other screening methods .
experts hope to start using the technique in the uk soon .
there is a dramatic change in implantation rate with this technology dr dagan wells oxford university it is thought that many miscarriages are due to an embryo carrying an abnormal number of chromosomes .
as women age , the chances of this problem occurring become higher .
however , until now it has proved difficult to examine all the chromosomes in an embryo , meaning that screening techniques have only produced limited success in weeding out those with little chance of leading to a successful pregnancy .
cgh solves the problem by allowing doctors to look at every chromosome in the developing embryo .
in the latest study , experts from oxford university analysed the results of a clinical trial carried out by researchers at the colorado centre for reproductive medicine in the us .
a total of 23 women , with an average age of 37 took part .
each had unsuccessfully tried ivf before .
the women 's eggs were fertilised , and the resulting embryos were allowed to grow for five days until they reached the blastocyst stage when they were analysed using cgh .
as a result all 23 women had at least one normal embryo to transfer to their womb , and in total 50 apparently healthy embryos were transferred in 23 cycles of treatment .
this lead to 21 pregnancies , of which 18 passed the crucial first three months when most miscarriages occur .
experts predict the live birth rate will be 78 % .
this compares with an anticipated 60 % for the same patients without embryo screening .
phenomenal results dr dagan wells , from oxford university , described the results as " phenomenal " .
he said : " chromosomal abnormalities are the main cause of implantation failure and miscarriage , and a way of detecting them should improve success rates .
" there is a dramatic change in implantation rate with this technology .
" the pregnancy rates we 've got so far are absolutely phenomenal . "
dr wells has applied for a licence to start offering cgh to uk patients , at a cost of about £ 2,000 per screening .
cgh works by labelling chromosomes taken from cells in the blastocyst with a green fluorescent tag .
by the time an embryo has reached the blastocyst stage it is more robust , meaning that cells can be extracted for testing more safely .
this dna is then mixed with the dna of a chromosomally normal individual , which is tagged red .
the red chromosomes act as a kind of template to which the embryo 's dna attaches .
you can then determine whether there are too many or too few of any chromosome from the colour .
for example , if the embryo 's cells carry an extra copy of chromosome 21 that chromosome will look green in the combined sample , but if the embryo has only one copy it will look redder .
dr allan pacey , a fertility expert at the university of sheffield , and member of the british fertility society , said older forms of genetic screening had proved to be of limited use at best .
he said : " there is a need to investigate whether new techniques are more effective . "

dr wells has applied for a licence to start offering cgh to uk patients , at a cost of about £ 2,000 per screening .
cgh works by labelling chromosomes taken from cells in the blastocyst with a green fluorescent tag .
by the time an embryo has reached the blastocyst stage it is more robust , meaning that cells can be extracted for testing more safely .
this dna is then mixed with the dna of a chromosomally normal individual , which is tagged red .
the red chromosomes act as a kind of template to which the embryo 's dna attaches .
you can then determine whether there are too many or too few of any chromosome from the colour .
for example , if the embryo 's cells carry an extra copy of chromosome 21 that chromosome will look green in the combined sample , but if the embryo has only one copy it will look redder .
dr allan pacey , a fertility expert at the university of sheffield , and member of the british fertility society , said older forms of genetic screening had proved to be of limited use at best .
he said : " there is a need to investigate whether new techniques are more effective . "

comparative genomic hybridisation -lrb- cgh -rrb- enables doctors to scrutinise an embryo 's chromosomes for abnormalities more closely than ever before .
the american society of reproductive medicine heard that implantation rates using cgh were 62 % - around twice that achieved by other screening methods .
experts hope to start using the technique in the uk soon .
there is a dramatic change in implantation rate with this technology dr dagan wells oxford university it is thought that many miscarriages are due to an embryo carrying an abnormal number of chromosomes .
as women age , the chances of this problem occurring become higher .
however , until now it has proved difficult to examine all the chromosomes in an embryo , meaning that screening techniques have only produced limited success in weeding out those with little chance of leading to a successful pregnancy .
cgh solves the problem by allowing doctors to look at every chromosome in the developing embryo .
in the latest study , experts from oxford university analysed the results of a clinical trial carried out by researchers at the colorado centre for reproductive medicine in the us .
a total of 23 women , with an average age of 37 took part .
each had unsuccessfully tried ivf before .
the women 's eggs were fertilised , and the resulting embryos were allowed to grow for five days until they reached the blastocyst stage when they were analysed using cgh .
as a result all 23 women had at least one normal embryo to transfer to their womb , and in total 50 apparently healthy embryos were transferred in 23 cycles of treatment .
this lead to 21 pregnancies , of which 18 passed the crucial first three months when most miscarriages occur .
experts predict the live birth rate will be 78 % .
this compares with an anticipated 60 % for the same patients without embryo screening .
phenomenal results dr dagan wells , from oxford university , described the results as " phenomenal " .
he said : " chromosomal abnormalities are the main cause of implantation failure and miscarriage , and a way of detecting them should improve success rates .
" there is a dramatic change in implantation rate with this technology .
" the pregnancy rates we 've got so far are absolutely phenomenal . "
dr wells has applied for a licence to start offering cgh to uk patients , at a cost of about £ 2,000 per screening .
cgh works by labelling chromosomes taken from cells in the blastocyst with a green fluorescent tag .
by the time an embryo has reached the blastocyst stage it is more robust , meaning that cells can be extracted for testing more safely .
this dna is then mixed with the dna of a chromosomally normal individual , which is tagged red .
