meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "

unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the government is focused on unfreezing the credit market " these principles have to be adhered to across the world , " merkel said .
" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .
the world is currently learning this lesson . "
unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .
merkel , who faces a general election in september , said she would meet regularly with business and political leaders to discuss how the measures were taking effect . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 31.12.2008 vilnius takes takes center stage as european culture capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilnius is expecting 3 million visitors lithuania 's capital of vilnius will show off its art and architecture as a european capital of culture in 2009 .
the city is pulling out all the stops to shine during its year in the spotlight . the new year marks not only vilnius ' millennial anniversary , but also the first occasion that a metropolis in a former communist-ruled soviet republic has been awarded the title of european capital of culture .
both the city and the country are keen to show themselves as authentic , hospitable destinations .
" it is important to remind europe and the world of our heritage and it is equally vital to show how we live today in order that europeans interested in lithuania can discover just how close to them we are , " president valdas adamkus told dpa news agency .
lithuania has always been a european country , even if it did vanish from sight for nearly 50 years as a part of the soviet union .
plenty of architectural gems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuanian art will be on display fortunately the neglect of the architecture and infrastructure of the old quarter of vilnius by the soviet occupiers has been largely made good .
and since 1994 , this city of many epochs has been included in the unesco world heritage list because it " has preserved an impressive complex of gothic , renaissance , baroque and classical buildings as well as its medieval layout and natural setting . "
vilnius has also been renowned for the beauty of its baroque architecture since the 17th century when artists from italy , southern germany and what was then the austrian-habsburg empire settled there and worked alongside local builders .
vilnius offers up art galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slew of cultural events and concerts are being planned meanwhile , one of the world 's most famous light artists , gert hof of germany , is due to light up the wintry skies over vilnius with a spectacular show scheduled for the eve of 2009 .
it is one of 120 projects encompassing 900 events which are being staged to mark the city 's role as a leading cultural center .
the aim is to celebrate the dynamism of this eastern european metropolis and to lay the foundation for a range of future cultural and musical events to be held on an annual basis .
among the attractions are art and theater programs , a street music festival and a roster of rock and alternative music concerts under the title of " be2gether . "
most of the events are free of charge to visitors .
vilnius will benefit from a 2009 budget of some 30 million euros -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- for the various programs and 55 million euros for a range of infrastructure projects .
conflicting messages yet not everyone is happy that vilnius has been chosen as a european capital of culture .
an editorial in the leading lithuanian daily newspaper lietuvos rytas blasted well-known figures in vilnius for homophobia , anti-semitism and racism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists are eager to show off roma culture the roma , also sometimes referred to as gypsies , hope to use the international attention to highlight their own plight .
augustinas beinaravicius , who is helping organize a festival featuring roma music , dance and folklore , told deutsche welle that the going has been difficult .
" we decided to organize this festival because in lithuania minorities are not dealt with very well politically or socially , " beinaravicius said .
" they are somewhat oppressed by the government and we do n't like that . "
svetlana novopolskaja , who is herself roma , said that the situation is very bad .
there are about 500 people living in a political limbo of sorts in vilnius , she told deutsche welle .
officially , many are not legally allowed to be living in the country , she said .
roma will show their culture two years ago , the former mayor of vilnius had ordered the houses in the roma settlement outside town to be demolished .
but the roma fought against it .
they continue to live outside of vilnius , completely separated from the rest of society and are considered by many to be thieves and drug dealers .
novopolskaja said she hopes the designation of vilnius as a cultural capital will change that .
" the roma hope that things that they can really do well , such as sing and dance , will be recognized by the majority of people , " she said .
" and that maybe with this they will be more accepted than they have been until now . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the government is focused on unfreezing the credit market " these principles have to be adhered to across the world , " merkel said .
" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .
the world is currently learning this lesson . "
unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .
eu calls for negotiated settlement the european commission called wednesday for a " negotiated settlement " between russia and ukraine over the gas supply row . " we are following developments very closely . " said commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs " talked to both sides on monday , encouraging them to find a negotiated solution . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .
eu calls for negotiated settlement the european commission called wednesday for a " negotiated settlement " between russia and ukraine over the gas supply row . " we are following developments very closely . " said commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the government is focused on unfreezing the credit market " these principles have to be adhered to across the world , " merkel said .
" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .

unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .
merkel , who faces a general election in september , said she would meet regularly with business and political leaders to discuss how the measures were taking effect . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the government is focused on unfreezing the credit market " these principles have to be adhered to across the world , " merkel said .
" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .
the world is currently learning this lesson . "
unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

the aim is to celebrate the dynamism of this eastern european metropolis and to lay the foundation for a range of future cultural and musical events to be held on an annual basis .
among the attractions are art and theater programs , a street music festival and a roster of rock and alternative music concerts under the title of " be2gether . "
most of the events are free of charge to visitors .
vilnius will benefit from a 2009 budget of some 30 million euros -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- for the various programs and 55 million euros for a range of infrastructure projects .
conflicting messages yet not everyone is happy that vilnius has been chosen as a european capital of culture .
an editorial in the leading lithuanian daily newspaper lietuvos rytas blasted well-known figures in vilnius for homophobia , anti-semitism and racism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists are eager to show off roma culture the roma , also sometimes referred to as gypsies , hope to use the international attention to highlight their own plight .
augustinas beinaravicius , who is helping organize a festival featuring roma music , dance and folklore , told deutsche welle that the going has been difficult .
" we decided to organize this festival because in lithuania minorities are not dealt with very well politically or socially , " beinaravicius said .
" they are somewhat oppressed by the government and we do n't like that . "
svetlana novopolskaja , who is herself roma , said that the situation is very bad .
there are about 500 people living in a political limbo of sorts in vilnius , she told deutsche welle .
officially , many are not legally allowed to be living in the country , she said .
roma will show their culture two years ago , the former mayor of vilnius had ordered the houses in the roma settlement outside town to be demolished .
but the roma fought against it .
they continue to live outside of vilnius , completely separated from the rest of society and are considered by many to be thieves and drug dealers .
novopolskaja said she hopes the designation of vilnius as a cultural capital will change that .
" the roma hope that things that they can really do well , such as sing and dance , will be recognized by the majority of people , " she said .
" and that maybe with this they will be more accepted than they have been until now . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the government is focused on unfreezing the credit market " these principles have to be adhered to across the world , " merkel said .
" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .
the world is currently learning this lesson . "
unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the government is focused on unfreezing the credit market " these principles have to be adhered to across the world , " merkel said .
" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .
the world is currently learning this lesson . "
unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .
merkel , who faces a general election in september , said she would meet regularly with business and political leaders to discuss how the measures were taking effect . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.12.2008 russia says ukraine threatening europe 's gas supply großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supplies to ukraine will be cut off if no new contract is agreed russian gas exporter gazprom has warned customers in europe that ukraine may interrupt supplies by siphoning fuel from transit pipelines should russia cut deliveries to the country . in the latest chapter in a row over money ukraine owes russia for gas deliveries , a gazprom spokesman accused ukraine of threatening europe 's gas supply on state television .
meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .
eu calls for negotiated settlement the european commission called wednesday for a " negotiated settlement " between russia and ukraine over the gas supply row . " we are following developments very closely . " said commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann .

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.

according to the associated press , eitb , which managed to stay on air despite the explosion at its headquarters in central bilbao city , said in its early afternoon news report that the blast caused significant damage and one person was injured .
police said the bomb exploded shortly after 11 am local time .
the basque separatist group called in a warning one hour before the explosion , allowing police to evacuate the building and cordon off the area .
spain 's state-run television station broadcast footage showing the explosion .
after a flash of fire , the blast blew out dozens of windows on the glass facade of the six-story building .
four decades of terrorism media groups have frequently been targets of eta , which is blamed for the deaths of 825 people in its 40-year campaign for an independent basque homeland comprising parts of northern spain and south western france . both the european union and the united states consider it a terrorist group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in jan .
2007 , hundreds protested for peace in madrid after eta attacks killed two .
eta has habitually staged attacks at the end of the year , most recently on december 30 , 2006 , when it bombed a car parked at madrid airport , killing two ecuadoran men who were sleeping in their cars . that attack torpedoed tentative peace talks with the socialist government prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
eta then formally called off a 15-month-old ceasefire in june , 2007 . zapatero condemned wednesday 's bombing , saying " eta can stage attacks , but it will lose all the battles . " spain and france step up crack downs eta is blamed for the deaths of four people this year , including a municipal councillor killed two days before general elections in march and a basque businessman who was gunned down in the street early this month . but it has been hard hit this year by police operations in both spain and france .
the two countries have stepped up cooperation to crack down on eta since a special accord was signed in january 2008 allowing spanish agents to operate in south western france . " after all the blows it has suffered this year , " wednesday 's attack " is a way of saying ' we are still here , " ' said one basque analyst , gorka landaburu , the director of the weekly newspaper " cambio 16 . " he said the attack was likely aimed at moderate basque nationalists , who support greater autonomy for the basque region but not full independence . " the basque television ... is linked to the basque government and the -lrb- moderate -rrb- basque nationalist party , which has governed the region for the past 25 years . " today , young eta members no longer have any scruples about attacking basque moderate nationalism , " he told afp wire service . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists are eager to show off roma culture the roma , also sometimes referred to as gypsies , hope to use the international attention to highlight their own plight .
augustinas beinaravicius , who is helping organize a festival featuring roma music , dance and folklore , told deutsche welle that the going has been difficult .
" we decided to organize this festival because in lithuania minorities are not dealt with very well politically or socially , " beinaravicius said .
" they are somewhat oppressed by the government and we do n't like that . "
svetlana novopolskaja , who is herself roma , said that the situation is very bad .
there are about 500 people living in a political limbo of sorts in vilnius , she told deutsche welle .
officially , many are not legally allowed to be living in the country , she said .
roma will show their culture two years ago , the former mayor of vilnius had ordered the houses in the roma settlement outside town to be demolished .
but the roma fought against it .
they continue to live outside of vilnius , completely separated from the rest of society and are considered by many to be thieves and drug dealers .
novopolskaja said she hopes the designation of vilnius as a cultural capital will change that .
" the roma hope that things that they can really do well , such as sing and dance , will be recognized by the majority of people , " she said .
" and that maybe with this they will be more accepted than they have been until now . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 31.12.2008 vilnius takes takes center stage as european culture capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilnius is expecting 3 million visitors lithuania 's capital of vilnius will show off its art and architecture as a european capital of culture in 2009 .
the city is pulling out all the stops to shine during its year in the spotlight . the new year marks not only vilnius ' millennial anniversary , but also the first occasion that a metropolis in a former communist-ruled soviet republic has been awarded the title of european capital of culture .
both the city and the country are keen to show themselves as authentic , hospitable destinations .
" it is important to remind europe and the world of our heritage and it is equally vital to show how we live today in order that europeans interested in lithuania can discover just how close to them we are , " president valdas adamkus told dpa news agency .
lithuania has always been a european country , even if it did vanish from sight for nearly 50 years as a part of the soviet union .
plenty of architectural gems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuanian art will be on display fortunately the neglect of the architecture and infrastructure of the old quarter of vilnius by the soviet occupiers has been largely made good .
and since 1994 , this city of many epochs has been included in the unesco world heritage list because it " has preserved an impressive complex of gothic , renaissance , baroque and classical buildings as well as its medieval layout and natural setting . "
vilnius has also been renowned for the beauty of its baroque architecture since the 17th century when artists from italy , southern germany and what was then the austrian-habsburg empire settled there and worked alongside local builders .
vilnius offers up art galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slew of cultural events and concerts are being planned meanwhile , one of the world 's most famous light artists , gert hof of germany , is due to light up the wintry skies over vilnius with a spectacular show scheduled for the eve of 2009 .
it is one of 120 projects encompassing 900 events which are being staged to mark the city 's role as a leading cultural center .
the aim is to celebrate the dynamism of this eastern european metropolis and to lay the foundation for a range of future cultural and musical events to be held on an annual basis .
among the attractions are art and theater programs , a street music festival and a roster of rock and alternative music concerts under the title of " be2gether . "
most of the events are free of charge to visitors .
vilnius will benefit from a 2009 budget of some 30 million euros -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- for the various programs and 55 million euros for a range of infrastructure projects .

roma will show their culture two years ago , the former mayor of vilnius had ordered the houses in the roma settlement outside town to be demolished .
but the roma fought against it .
they continue to live outside of vilnius , completely separated from the rest of society and are considered by many to be thieves and drug dealers .
novopolskaja said she hopes the designation of vilnius as a cultural capital will change that .
" the roma hope that things that they can really do well , such as sing and dance , will be recognized by the majority of people , " she said .
" and that maybe with this they will be more accepted than they have been until now . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "

" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .

unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .

in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .

both the city and the country are keen to show themselves as authentic , hospitable destinations .
" it is important to remind europe and the world of our heritage and it is equally vital to show how we live today in order that europeans interested in lithuania can discover just how close to them we are , " president valdas adamkus told dpa news agency .

both the city and the country are keen to show themselves as authentic , hospitable destinations .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "

" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .

unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.12.2008 russia says ukraine threatening europe 's gas supply großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supplies to ukraine will be cut off if no new contract is agreed russian gas exporter gazprom has warned customers in europe that ukraine may interrupt supplies by siphoning fuel from transit pipelines should russia cut deliveries to the country . in the latest chapter in a row over money ukraine owes russia for gas deliveries , a gazprom spokesman accused ukraine of threatening europe 's gas supply on state television .
meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .
eu calls for negotiated settlement the european commission called wednesday for a " negotiated settlement " between russia and ukraine over the gas supply row . " we are following developments very closely . " said commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann .
eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs " talked to both sides on monday , encouraging them to find a negotiated solution . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "

unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

the violence between israeli and hamas forces continued on wednesday morning with hamas rockets hitting the major israeli city of beersheba , and israel rejecting a french proposal for a 48-hour truce that would allow more humanitarian aid into the gaza strip .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said it was unrealistic for israel to " cease fire unilaterally with no mechanism to enforce the cessation of shooting and terror from hamas . "
in her address , merkel said that " the terror perpetrated by hamas is unacceptable . "
" but we should also not forget there is no rational alternative to the peaceful co-existence of palestinians and israelis in two states .
this is in the interests of people on both sides , " she continued .
" the german government will provide whatever assistance it can towards this , " she said as the death toll in gaza climbed above 360 on the fifth day of israeli airstrikes prompted by hamas missile attacks on the jewish state .
call for social responsibility turning to the global economy , merkel said it had been plunged into crisis by financial excess carried out without social responsibility and with a loss of proportion by many bankers and managers .
" the world has lived above its means , " she said , adding that " only once we recognize these causes can we extricate the world from this crisis .
to do this we need a clear set of principles . "
these , she said , had to entail greater social responsibility in business and financial dealings and recognize that the state is " the guardian of economic and social order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the government is focused on unfreezing the credit market " these principles have to be adhered to across the world , " merkel said .
" only then will it be able to overcome the crisis .
the world is currently learning this lesson . "
unlocking cash flows the chancellor also outlined the steps her government was taking to pull the german economy out of recession and ensure that jobs are made secure and new ones created .
" first of all we need to make sure that our businesses have access to the necessary credit .
the state will have to jump in if banks do not live up to their responsibilities . "
the government set up a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 560-billion -rrb- fund in october to ease the liquidity problems of financial institutions caught up in the global credit squeeze .
but there have been complaints that banks are not taking sufficient advantage of the scheme .
the government has called on lenders to take up their the offer and ease credit restrictions for small and medium-sized firms .
further pledges merkel also promised to increase investment in education and infrastructure projects as well as extend high-speed internet connections to rural areas .
the measures form part of an economic stimulus package the government plans to unveil in january on the heels of another 32-billion-euro package announced earlier this month .

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .

meanwhile , ukrainian officials entered last-ditch talks in moscow to avoid a gas supply cutoff on january 1 .
ukraine has already pledged to pay as much as $ 2 billion in debt for gas supplies delivered in 2008 .
but disagreements remain over the price ukraine would pay for russian gas in 2009 - a major stumbling block to the two sides signing a new contract to replace the current one that expires at the end of this year .
the accusation of blackmail is not helping matters .
gazprom officials said they had received a letter from ukraine 's state energy firm naftogaz stating that if russia turns off the gas , ukraine could confiscate russian fuel bound for western europe .
gazprom chairman alexander medvedev produced a copy of the letter at a news conference in moscow on wednesday .
" it is impossible to view the letter as anything less than blackmail , " medvedev told journalists in the televised conference .
" this puts us in a situation when transit volumes to western europe are in danger . "
he said the move undercut ukraine 's credibility as a gas transit partner and violated its contracts for shipping on gas supplies to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov " frankly speaking , if yesterday we were putting the chances at 50:50 , today it is maybe a 70:30 probability of a crisis scenario , " spokesman sergei kupriyanov told a news conference .
western europe dependent on russia europe receives roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , over 80 percent of those supplies are exported via ukrainian pipelines .
ukraine , during a 2006 russian gas cut-off , siphoned some of the russian gas destined for europe , causing price spikes as far away as paris .
in order to avoid a repeat of those events , the government of ukraine yesterday ordered two state banks to lend naftogaz $ 2 billion to settle the debt .
an announcement by naftogaz earlier that it had transferred $ 1.5 billion to middle-man gas trading firm rosukrenergo for the settlement of its debt had looked to be a breakthrough in talks .
medvedev confirmed that the money had reached rosukrenergo , a russian-ukrainian intermediary based in switzerland , adding he hoped it would soon be added to gazprom 's accounts .
but gazprom 's allegations of blackmail against naftogaz have now created an " unprecedented " situation , kupriyanov said , adding that the chances of reaching a deal now before midnight are highly unlikely .
in kiev , naftogaz declined to comment on the letter .
but president viktor yushchenko 's first deputy chief of staff , oleksander shlapak , said ukraine guranteed uninterrupted transit of russian gas to europe through its territory .
gas cuts to ukraine would start at 10 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- january 1 , if a new contract for gas supplies to ukraine was not signed by the end of day , kupriyanov said .

on december 31 , 2008 , simon wiesenthal would have celebrated his 100th birthday . simon wiesenthal once said that his purpose in life was to warn the murderers of tomorrow that they will never find rest .
if he could n't do that , then millions of people died for nothing .
he was referring to victims of the nazi holocaust of world war ii . wiesenthal was a voice for the survivors of the holocaust , but also for those who lost their lives in the concentration camps .
wiesenthal worked most of his life making sure that these crimes against humanity would never be hushed up or whitewashed .
some people labeled him a “ justice fanatic ” , others viewed him as a role model and hero .
the early years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal became famous for his work as the nazi hunter , even speaking at the united nations simon wiesenthal was born on dec .
31 , 1908 , to a jewish family living in galicia , which at the time was part of the austro-hungarian empire .
he studied architecture in lemburg and was able to pursue that passion until 1940 , when the german army marched in and took over .
wiesenthal spent the next several years in countless forced labor and concentration camps .
in 1945 wiesenthal was among those freed from the mauthausen death camp in austria by the us army .
it was shortly thereafter that he was reunited with the love of his life , cyla , whose entire family was killed by the nazis .
life 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two centers were built to house wiesenthal 's findings , one in vienna and the other in los angeles it was in that same year that wiesenthal started his real life 's work : hunting down and capturing former members of the nazi party .
he was contracted by the us government to take on this task and drew on his experiences and memories from the war to accomplish it .
he even recalled many of the perpetrator 's names from his time in concentration camps .
two years later wiesenthal , along with other survivors , founded a center for the documentation of crimes committed against european jews in linz , austria .
in 1961 a jewish documentation center in vienna was created .
soon the small office there was filled with documents , notes , memorabilia and evidence .
the americans followed the example , and by 1977 there was a similar institution established in los angeles named in wiesenthal 's honor .
nazi hunter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was one of the prominent nazis wiesenthal helped bring to justice wiesenthal contributed to the capture of many prominent nazis , including adolf eichmann , who was put on trial in israel in 1961 ; franz stangl , commandant of the treblinka concentration camp ; and hermine braunsteiner , who was responsible for the murder of hundreds of children at the majdanek concentration camp .
simon wiesenthal always considered himself a researcher who was simply working to make sure the holocaust would never be forgotten and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice .
guilt , he always stressed , was individual .
he never wanted to be a hate-driven nazi hunter , saying that hate was a foreign emotion to him .
for sixty years wiesenthal collected , researched and documented – living deep in his dark memories .
he was been honored multiple times for his life 's work .
simon wiesenthal died on september 20 , 2005 at the age of 96 . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the first issues of the year was the outcome of a controversial planning application .
the giant 's causeway needed a new visitor 's centre and in 2007 environment minister arlene foster had previously expressed her mind to go with a local developer 's plans .
but this year , she was forced to change that mind when the national trust did a deal with moyle council , closing the door on other developments .
it was a slightly embarrassing back-down to what had always promised to be a controversial subject .
soon the minister was to move on , but not before she 'd decided that there would be no independent environment protection agency .
the main demand for the agency had come from the various environmental non governmental organisations -lrb- ngos -rrb- who had earlier ' persuaded ' the government to carry out a review of the need for more independence in environment governance .
the review reported in favour of an independent body .
but arlene foster was undaunted , deciding on a different path for environmental governance and a different career for herself .
she announced that there would be no independent agency and then moved to the deti .
' in with the new ' a new minister , sammy wilson , took over at the start of the summer and made his approach very clear from the start .
the ice caps are melting but what does the environment minister think about climate change ?
he also did n't believe in an epa and did n't agree with the majority view that climate change was man-made .
these were viewpoints that went down badly with the aforementioned ngos .
they listened in jaw-dropping amazement as mr wilson set out his stall .
the minister accepted climate change was happening although he was n't sure if it was n't just a cyclical change rather than a major change for the worst .
he has stuck firmly to this approach ever since .
revamp and he also had new plans for his department .
the environment and heritage service , the backbone of the doe 's environment focus was revamped and rebranded .
and so the niea or northern ireland environment agency was born .
wags immediately dubbed it the no independent environment agency .
but the minister was adamant that the new agency would do things better and more efficiently that any independent agency .
in its place pps 21 was born .
it was almost the same but with some important tweaks £ 6m for giant 's causeway project ' green ' watchdog for ni ruled out back from the brink , red kites return he claimed that the much-lauded independent agencies in the rest of the uk were not as proficient as many made out .
there was one special headache facing the new minister .
a planning policy known as pps 14 had been previously introduced as a control over building in the countryside .
it presumed against new single dwellings in rural areas or so it was claimed .
a direct rule policy , it was universally unpopular amongst most political parties but universally popular with most environmental groups .
but pps 14 had run into legal problems .
so , one judicial review , one public review and lots of delayed planning applications later , pps 14 was finally shelved .
in its place pps 21 was born .
it was almost the same but with some important tweaks .
but even more importantly , it was widely accepted by most .
problem solved .
one of the most colourful moments of the year was the reintroduction of red kites back into northern ireland after a 300 year gap .
the rspb released 27 birds in county down more than 20 birds were released by the rspb in the castlewellan area and took to the skies like veterans despite never having flown outside their pens before .
they now face their first winter alone and will have to find food in the forests and hills of county down .
and the woodland trust came up with a clever plan to encourage ancient woodlands .
they bought land surrounding a site in londonderry and will allow the ancient trees to spread their branches , quite literally , along with their roots over the new ground .
these were just a couple of the many environmental schemes carried out by ngos in the past year .
good year ?
so was 2008 a good year for the environment ?
well , it was n't a major year of change .
illegal cross-border dumping still continues , albeit at a much reduced level .
river pollution is alive and frequent .
but we are getting closer to sensible recycling targets and slowly weaning ourselves off landfills .
we are still very short of habitat protection and areas of special scientific interest -lrb- assi -rrb- , and another year has slipped past without important changes in these areas .
and there are new ministerial challenges for the new year .
they include the local response to the climate change bill and just as important , a clear direction for northern ireland on the new marine bill .
at the very least these will test the minister and his personal philosophies to the extreme .

one of the first issues of the year was the outcome of a controversial planning application .
the giant 's causeway needed a new visitor 's centre and in 2007 environment minister arlene foster had previously expressed her mind to go with a local developer 's plans .
but this year , she was forced to change that mind when the national trust did a deal with moyle council , closing the door on other developments .
it was a slightly embarrassing back-down to what had always promised to be a controversial subject .
soon the minister was to move on , but not before she 'd decided that there would be no independent environment protection agency .
the main demand for the agency had come from the various environmental non governmental organisations -lrb- ngos -rrb- who had earlier ' persuaded ' the government to carry out a review of the need for more independence in environment governance .
the review reported in favour of an independent body .
but arlene foster was undaunted , deciding on a different path for environmental governance and a different career for herself .
she announced that there would be no independent agency and then moved to the deti .
' in with the new ' a new minister , sammy wilson , took over at the start of the summer and made his approach very clear from the start .
the ice caps are melting but what does the environment minister think about climate change ?
he also did n't believe in an epa and did n't agree with the majority view that climate change was man-made .
these were viewpoints that went down badly with the aforementioned ngos .
they listened in jaw-dropping amazement as mr wilson set out his stall .
the minister accepted climate change was happening although he was n't sure if it was n't just a cyclical change rather than a major change for the worst .
he has stuck firmly to this approach ever since .
revamp and he also had new plans for his department .
the environment and heritage service , the backbone of the doe 's environment focus was revamped and rebranded .
and so the niea or northern ireland environment agency was born .
wags immediately dubbed it the no independent environment agency .
but the minister was adamant that the new agency would do things better and more efficiently that any independent agency .
in its place pps 21 was born .
it was almost the same but with some important tweaks £ 6m for giant 's causeway project ' green ' watchdog for ni ruled out back from the brink , red kites return he claimed that the much-lauded independent agencies in the rest of the uk were not as proficient as many made out .
there was one special headache facing the new minister .
a planning policy known as pps 14 had been previously introduced as a control over building in the countryside .
it presumed against new single dwellings in rural areas or so it was claimed .
a direct rule policy , it was universally unpopular amongst most political parties but universally popular with most environmental groups .
but pps 14 had run into legal problems .
so , one judicial review , one public review and lots of delayed planning applications later , pps 14 was finally shelved .
in its place pps 21 was born .
it was almost the same but with some important tweaks .
but even more importantly , it was widely accepted by most .
problem solved .
one of the most colourful moments of the year was the reintroduction of red kites back into northern ireland after a 300 year gap .
the rspb released 27 birds in county down more than 20 birds were released by the rspb in the castlewellan area and took to the skies like veterans despite never having flown outside their pens before .
they now face their first winter alone and will have to find food in the forests and hills of county down .
and the woodland trust came up with a clever plan to encourage ancient woodlands .
they bought land surrounding a site in londonderry and will allow the ancient trees to spread their branches , quite literally , along with their roots over the new ground .
these were just a couple of the many environmental schemes carried out by ngos in the past year .
good year ?
so was 2008 a good year for the environment ?
well , it was n't a major year of change .
illegal cross-border dumping still continues , albeit at a much reduced level .
river pollution is alive and frequent .
but we are getting closer to sensible recycling targets and slowly weaning ourselves off landfills .
we are still very short of habitat protection and areas of special scientific interest -lrb- assi -rrb- , and another year has slipped past without important changes in these areas .
and there are new ministerial challenges for the new year .
they include the local response to the climate change bill and just as important , a clear direction for northern ireland on the new marine bill .
at the very least these will test the minister and his personal philosophies to the extreme .

one of the first issues of the year was the outcome of a controversial planning application .
the giant 's causeway needed a new visitor 's centre and in 2007 environment minister arlene foster had previously expressed her mind to go with a local developer 's plans .
but this year , she was forced to change that mind when the national trust did a deal with moyle council , closing the door on other developments .
it was a slightly embarrassing back-down to what had always promised to be a controversial subject .
soon the minister was to move on , but not before she 'd decided that there would be no independent environment protection agency .
the main demand for the agency had come from the various environmental non governmental organisations -lrb- ngos -rrb- who had earlier ' persuaded ' the government to carry out a review of the need for more independence in environment governance .
the review reported in favour of an independent body .
but arlene foster was undaunted , deciding on a different path for environmental governance and a different career for herself .
she announced that there would be no independent agency and then moved to the deti .
' in with the new ' a new minister , sammy wilson , took over at the start of the summer and made his approach very clear from the start .
the ice caps are melting but what does the environment minister think about climate change ?
he also did n't believe in an epa and did n't agree with the majority view that climate change was man-made .
these were viewpoints that went down badly with the aforementioned ngos .
they listened in jaw-dropping amazement as mr wilson set out his stall .
the minister accepted climate change was happening although he was n't sure if it was n't just a cyclical change rather than a major change for the worst .
he has stuck firmly to this approach ever since .
revamp and he also had new plans for his department .
the environment and heritage service , the backbone of the doe 's environment focus was revamped and rebranded .
and so the niea or northern ireland environment agency was born .
wags immediately dubbed it the no independent environment agency .
but the minister was adamant that the new agency would do things better and more efficiently that any independent agency .
in its place pps 21 was born .
it was almost the same but with some important tweaks £ 6m for giant 's causeway project ' green ' watchdog for ni ruled out back from the brink , red kites return he claimed that the much-lauded independent agencies in the rest of the uk were not as proficient as many made out .
there was one special headache facing the new minister .
a planning policy known as pps 14 had been previously introduced as a control over building in the countryside .
it presumed against new single dwellings in rural areas or so it was claimed .
a direct rule policy , it was universally unpopular amongst most political parties but universally popular with most environmental groups .
but pps 14 had run into legal problems .
so , one judicial review , one public review and lots of delayed planning applications later , pps 14 was finally shelved .
in its place pps 21 was born .
it was almost the same but with some important tweaks .
but even more importantly , it was widely accepted by most .
problem solved .
one of the most colourful moments of the year was the reintroduction of red kites back into northern ireland after a 300 year gap .
the rspb released 27 birds in county down more than 20 birds were released by the rspb in the castlewellan area and took to the skies like veterans despite never having flown outside their pens before .
they now face their first winter alone and will have to find food in the forests and hills of county down .
and the woodland trust came up with a clever plan to encourage ancient woodlands .
they bought land surrounding a site in londonderry and will allow the ancient trees to spread their branches , quite literally , along with their roots over the new ground .
these were just a couple of the many environmental schemes carried out by ngos in the past year .
good year ?
so was 2008 a good year for the environment ?
well , it was n't a major year of change .
illegal cross-border dumping still continues , albeit at a much reduced level .
river pollution is alive and frequent .
but we are getting closer to sensible recycling targets and slowly weaning ourselves off landfills .
we are still very short of habitat protection and areas of special scientific interest -lrb- assi -rrb- , and another year has slipped past without important changes in these areas .
and there are new ministerial challenges for the new year .
they include the local response to the climate change bill and just as important , a clear direction for northern ireland on the new marine bill .
at the very least these will test the minister and his personal philosophies to the extreme .

from the data received the medical team can plot his mood swings , monitor how his medication is working and assess when he needs his next face-to-face appointment .
joe , aged 23 and from sussex , said that for him the system has been brilliant and has cut down the amount of time he needs to spent with the doctors for his bipolar disorder .
" for me it has fortunately proved to be extremely effective .
whereas before i would be going to see the doctors once a month or more now i only need to see them every three months to check that all is well , " said joe .
mood monitoring " from my perspective the phone texting has been a godsend . "
each patient using the scheme is given two small cards , marked with mood variations from a to e , which allow them to plot their moods for the previous week - depression and euphoria .
they then select which feeling most closely matches theirs and text over the corresponding letter . "
it has made recovery relatively painless " joe joe said the system provided an excellent support network .
" it is a simple thing , but because it is so regular it gives you a structure and giving the strong impression that someone at the other end is taking your data , " said joe .
" so often with depression you feel cut off from everything and with this there is a strange reassurance that things are being processed .
you really do benefit when you go for your next appointment with whoever is treating you and they bring up all your data .
" if there is a blip or hiccup they can check against medication you can tell what effect taking a pill or adding a pill can cause .
" and if they see an anomaly in your results they will contact you .
" it has been a massive support for me , " he said .
pain free recovery joe 's treatment has been so successful he has been able to return to university to complete his degree .
" that is thanks to the service , because without it the treatment could have taken twice as long .
it has made recovery relatively painless , " he added .
the system , a collaboration with oxfordshire and buckinghamshire mental health and oxford university 's department of psychiatry , has been such a success that it is now being expanded across the trust later in the new year .
professor john geddes at oxford university said that over 150 patients now self-monitor and that they also collect data from patients elsewhere in the uk and in colorado , the us , for use by their own clinicians .
professor geddes said the mood monitoring was vital .
" when you try to work out how their mood has been there are real problems trying to do that retrospectively , " said professor geddes .
" what people tend to do is either miss really important mood variability or just look at the average or very severe .
" we knew we needed a way of monitoring it .
a lot of people use mood diaries or computer systems .
the problem with the paper system is that only patients have access to that and the more sophisticated computer systems have problems because you need access to a computer .
" we wanted to create a system that was pretty low-tech and was very easy for patients and not too burdensome . "
system successes the software catches the message and then imports it automatically into spreadsheets and graphs .
" so when i see the patient in clinic i pretty much know how they have been , " said professor geddes .
" before i would spend quite a lot of time trying to find out how the patient had been and if the patient was depressed it could be quite hard for them to remember .
" basically , with this system we would hit the ground running and we can focus on trying to help them and their treatment . "
professor geddes said the system could probably be adapted to monitor people with other mental health disorders , such as less severe schizophrenia .
the system won the nhs live award in 2008 .
jo godman , of the nhs institute for innovation and improvement , said the system was an inspiration .
" this project has opened the eyes of many staff across the nhs .
we want to encourage more of this type of innovation . "
neil tinning , from the mdf bi-polar organisation , agreed the system offered hope .
" monitoring your mood on a daily basis is a foundation of self management of the illness , " he said .
" to have a mood mapping text messaging service to a health professional will provide a window into your illness .
this could lead to early intervention and potentiality head off serious episodes of this mood disorder . "

joe , aged 23 and from sussex , said that for him the system has been brilliant and has cut down the amount of time he needs to spent with the doctors for his bipolar disorder .
" for me it has fortunately proved to be extremely effective .
whereas before i would be going to see the doctors once a month or more now i only need to see them every three months to check that all is well , " said joe .
mood monitoring " from my perspective the phone texting has been a godsend . "
each patient using the scheme is given two small cards , marked with mood variations from a to e , which allow them to plot their moods for the previous week - depression and euphoria .
they then select which feeling most closely matches theirs and text over the corresponding letter .
it has made recovery relatively painless joe joe said the system provided an excellent support network .
" it is a simple thing , but because it is so regular it gives you a structure and giving the strong impression that someone at the other end is taking your data , " said joe .
" so often with depression you feel cut off from everything and with this there is a strange reassurance that things are being processed .
you really do benefit when you go for your next appointment with whoever is treating you and they bring up all your data .
" if there is a blip or hiccup they can check against medication you can tell what effect taking a pill or adding a pill can cause .
" and if they see an anomaly in your results they will contact you .
" it has been a massive support for me , " he said .
pain free recovery joe 's treatment has been so successful he has been able to return to university to complete his degree .
" that is thanks to the service , because without it the treatment could have taken twice as long .
it has made recovery relatively painless , " he added .
the service can plot mood changes the system , a collaboration with oxfordshire and buckinghamshire mental health and oxford university 's department of psychiatry , has been such a success that it is now being expanded across the trust later in the new year .
professor john geddes at oxford university said that over 150 patients now self-monitor and that they also collect data from patients elsewhere in the uk and in colorado , the us , for use by their own clinicians .
professor geddes said the mood monitoring was vital .
" when you try to work out how their mood has been there are real problems trying to do that retrospectively , " said professor geddes .
" what people tend to do is either miss really important mood variability or just look at the average or very severe .
" we knew we needed a way of monitoring it .
a lot of people use mood diaries or computer systems .
the problem with the paper system is that only patients have access to that and the more sophisticated computer systems have problems because you need access to a computer .
" we wanted to create a system that was pretty low-tech and was very easy for patients and not too burdensome . "
system successes the software catches the message and then imports it automatically into spreadsheets and graphs .
" so when i see the patient in clinic i pretty much know how they have been , " said professor geddes .
" before i would spend quite a lot of time trying to find out how the patient had been and if the patient was depressed it could be quite hard for them to remember .
" basically , with this system we would hit the ground running and we can focus on trying to help them and their treatment . "
professor geddes said the system could probably be adapted to monitor people with other mental health disorders , such as less severe schizophrenia .
the system won the nhs live award in 2008 .
jo godman , of the nhs institute for innovation and improvement , said the system was an inspiration .
" this project has opened the eyes of many staff across the nhs .
we want to encourage more of this type of innovation . "
neil tinning , from the mdf bi-polar organisation , agreed the system offered hope .
" monitoring your mood on a daily basis is a foundation of self management of the illness , " he said .
" to have a mood mapping text messaging service to a health professional will provide a window into your illness .
this could lead to early intervention and potentiality head off serious episodes of this mood disorder . "

from the data received the medical team can plot his mood swings , monitor how his medication is working and assess when he needs his next face-to-face appointment .
joe , aged 23 and from sussex , said that for him the system has been brilliant and has cut down the amount of time he needs to spent with the doctors for his bipolar disorder .
" for me it has fortunately proved to be extremely effective .
whereas before i would be going to see the doctors once a month or more now i only need to see them every three months to check that all is well , " said joe .
mood monitoring " from my perspective the phone texting has been a godsend . "
each patient using the scheme is given two small cards , marked with mood variations from a to e , which allow them to plot their moods for the previous week - depression and euphoria .
they then select which feeling most closely matches theirs and text over the corresponding letter .
it has made recovery relatively painless joe joe said the system provided an excellent support network .
" it is a simple thing , but because it is so regular it gives you a structure and giving the strong impression that someone at the other end is taking your data , " said joe .
" so often with depression you feel cut off from everything and with this there is a strange reassurance that things are being processed .
you really do benefit when you go for your next appointment with whoever is treating you and they bring up all your data .
" if there is a blip or hiccup they can check against medication you can tell what effect taking a pill or adding a pill can cause .
" and if they see an anomaly in your results they will contact you .
" it has been a massive support for me , " he said .
pain free recovery joe 's treatment has been so successful he has been able to return to university to complete his degree .
" that is thanks to the service , because without it the treatment could have taken twice as long .
it has made recovery relatively painless , " he added .
the service can plot mood changes the system , a collaboration with oxfordshire and buckinghamshire mental health and oxford university 's department of psychiatry , has been such a success that it is now being expanded across the trust later in the new year .
professor john geddes at oxford university said that over 150 patients now self-monitor and that they also collect data from patients elsewhere in the uk and in colorado , the us , for use by their own clinicians .
professor geddes said the mood monitoring was vital .
" when you try to work out how their mood has been there are real problems trying to do that retrospectively , " said professor geddes .
" what people tend to do is either miss really important mood variability or just look at the average or very severe .
" we knew we needed a way of monitoring it .
a lot of people use mood diaries or computer systems .
the problem with the paper system is that only patients have access to that and the more sophisticated computer systems have problems because you need access to a computer .
" we wanted to create a system that was pretty low-tech and was very easy for patients and not too burdensome . "

lord stern , who was behind the first detailed economic assessment of the impact of climate change , said us and chinese agreement to a cut was crucial .
president george w bush 's climate views were " prehistoric " and had been seen as an obstacle , lord stern told the bbc .
but many now believed the new president could take a lead , he said .
" he 's night and day on this issue relative to his prehistoric predecessor george bush , " lord stern told the bbc 's today programme 's guest editor jarvis cocker .
" that is a very big change and , while people saw the united states as a obstacle , now people are saying well perhaps the united states could really lead on this .
" and it is going to have to - because the two big ones on this are the united states and china . "
' technology hope ' lord stern is now chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and environment at the london school of economics .
he said in his interview that , as well as hoping for action from the new us leadership , he was encouraged by the the much deeper global understanding of climate change and its impact .
many countries had made a clear commitment to reducing greenhouse gases , he said , which showed things were moving in the right direction .
technological advances would also help , he argued .

" it is unavoidable that we do that if we are to be serious about this problem .
so , it 's a big challenge , but we have got a chance . "

" the first one is that the longer you let risks fester , the bigger the impact and the bigger the crash and consequences .
" if we emit greenhouse gases the concentrations in the atmosphere build up and it gets more and more difficult to act the later you leave it .

slowing down the work to tackle climate change during the current economic crisis would be a mistake , he added .
" it is fair to say the kinds of monies you would have to spend each year on dealing with climate change , in the sense of cutting back on emissions ... at the moment looks quite small relative to the sums that we 're having to put in to shore up the banking system . "
lord stern , a former world bank economist and currently chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at london school of economics and political science , compiled the stern review into the economics of climate change for the uk government in 2006 .

lord stern , who was behind the first detailed economic assessment of the impact of climate change , said us and chinese agreement to a cut was crucial .
president george w bush 's climate views were " prehistoric " and had been seen as an obstacle , lord stern told the bbc .
but many now believed the new president could take a lead , he said .
" he 's night and day on this issue relative to his prehistoric predecessor george bush , " lord stern told the bbc 's today programme 's guest editor jarvis cocker .
" that is a very big change and , while people saw the united states as a obstacle , now people are saying well perhaps the united states could really lead on this .
" and it is going to have to - because the two big ones on this are the united states and china . "
' technology hope ' lord stern is now chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and environment at the london school of economics .
he said in his interview that , as well as hoping for action from the new us leadership , he was encouraged by the the much deeper global understanding of climate change and its impact .
many countries had made a clear commitment to reducing greenhouse gases , he said , which showed things were moving in the right direction .
technological advances would also help , he argued .

" it is unavoidable that we do that if we are to be serious about this problem .
so , it 's a big challenge , but we have got a chance . "
crunch impact lord stern also said he believed the world could learn a number of lessons from the global economic crisis when dealing with climate change .
" the first one is that the longer you let risks fester , the bigger the impact and the bigger the crash and consequences .
" if we emit greenhouse gases the concentrations in the atmosphere build up and it gets more and more difficult to act the later you leave it .
" the second lesson is that we 're really going to have to collaborate on this one . "
slowing down the work to tackle climate change during the current economic crisis would be a mistake , he added .
" it is fair to say the kinds of monies you would have to spend each year on dealing with climate change , in the sense of cutting back on emissions ... at the moment looks quite small relative to the sums that we 're having to put in to shore up the banking system . "
lord stern , a former world bank economist and currently chair of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment at london school of economics and political science , compiled the stern review into the economics of climate change for the uk government in 2006 .
