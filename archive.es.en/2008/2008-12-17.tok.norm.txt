" no one in the -lrb- ruling coalition -rrb- government seems to give any thought as to where to promote savings .

" i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor . " when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .
when government makes vague pronouncements without clear policy goals as in last few days , this provokes an even deeper crisis , " steffen kampeter , the cdu budget spokesman , told the sueddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" no one in the -lrb- ruling coalition -rrb- government seems to give any thought as to where to promote savings . " fricke 's estimate is higher than information provided to the sueddeutsche zeitung by unnamed internal government sources , the paper reported in its wednesday edition . over budget by more than 30 billion euros a spokesman at the finance ministry would not confirm the paper 's estimate putting new debt for 2009 at 30 billion euros . official debt projected by the finance ministry for next year had been put at 18.5 billion euros based on estimated tax revenues and an economic growth rate of 0.2 percent in 2009 . but on tuesday , ministry officials had revised their estimates and said the german economy could contract by as much as 3.0 percent next year , meaning a loss of some 15 billion euros for the federal coffers , according to fricke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto fricke slammed the government for its unrealistic budget projections in addition , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government had estimated that the budget for unemployment benefits would be reduced in 2009 compared to this year in spite of the world economic crisis that has adversely affected not only the banking sector , but also the automobile industry . increased spending in 2009 " that is totally unrealistic , " fricke told the afp news agency of the government 's projections . " i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor . " when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .
when government makes vague pronouncements without clear policy goals as in last few days , this provokes an even deeper crisis , " steffen kampeter , the cdu budget spokesman , told the sueddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .

there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law .

there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 17.12.2008 britain 's brown announces full troop withdrawal from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi soldiers will fill the void left by uk troops who leave basra by the end of july .
during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law .

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law . " he said the law bans " bans terrorist acts which blindly target civilians such as attacks and rocket firing against israel " as well " any form of collective punishment " referring to the harsh israeli measures against the people of gaza in response to rocket attacks . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .

" when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .

17 . " the second economic stimulus package will generate new debts in the order of 50 billion euros , " fricke told national daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" no one in the -lrb- ruling coalition -rrb- government seems to give any thought as to where to promote savings . " fricke 's estimate is higher than information provided to the sueddeutsche zeitung by unnamed internal government sources , the paper reported in its wednesday edition . over budget by more than 30 billion euros a spokesman at the finance ministry would not confirm the paper 's estimate putting new debt for 2009 at 30 billion euros . official debt projected by the finance ministry for next year had been put at 18.5 billion euros based on estimated tax revenues and an economic growth rate of 0.2 percent in 2009 . but on tuesday , ministry officials had revised their estimates and said the german economy could contract by as much as 3.0 percent next year , meaning a loss of some 15 billion euros for the federal coffers , according to fricke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto fricke slammed the government for its unrealistic budget projections in addition , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government had estimated that the budget for unemployment benefits would be reduced in 2009 compared to this year in spite of the world economic crisis that has adversely affected not only the banking sector , but also the automobile industry . increased spending in 2009 " that is totally unrealistic , " fricke told the afp news agency of the government 's projections . " i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor . " when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .
when government makes vague pronouncements without clear policy goals as in last few days , this provokes an even deeper crisis , " steffen kampeter , the cdu budget spokesman , told the sueddeutsche zeitung . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "
deutsche bank shares were down as much as 9 percent during the course of wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor . " when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .

despite having gone 44 years without a major title , the spaniards made short work of the competition at this summer 's european championship in austria and switzerland .
the only blemish on their record , if one wants to call it that , was their victory on penalties over italy .
otherwise the team won all its matches in regulation time - both at the euro 2008 and in qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
no fewer than nine of its players were selected for the euro 2008 team of the tournament , including all four of the squad 's regular starting midfielders and the competition 's top goal-getter , striker david villa .
such was spain 's dominance that even fifa 's notoriously obscure mathematical formula for determining world rankings could not be thrown off track .

with germany also well on their way to qualifying for the next world cup , the only dark cloud on the horizon was the nasty public spat between national coach joachim loew and veteran midfielders michael ballack and torsten frings .

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .

automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2008 europeans disagree drastically on fed rate cut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has plunged against against the euro for some it was the right thing at the right time ; for others the end of the financial world as we know it .
the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "
deutsche bank shares were down as much as 9 percent during the course of wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .

" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "
deutsche bank shares were down as much as 9 percent during the course of wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law .

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating .

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .
wind and solar power are expected to play a greater role , as are bio-fuels , but the gap between europe 's energy reality and the future it foresees remains daunting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .

as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how could it have been otherwise in a year in which la seleccion won all of their matches ? the world 's governing football authority made the announcement at its headquarters in zurich on wednesday , dec .
17 , honoring what has to be considered one of the most dominant national squads in the history of the sport .
despite having gone 44 years without a major title , the spaniards made short work of the competition at this summer 's european championship in austria and switzerland .
the only blemish on their record , if one wants to call it that , was their victory on penalties over italy .
otherwise the team won all its matches in regulation time - both at the euro 2008 and in qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
no fewer than nine of its players were selected for the euro 2008 team of the tournament , including all four of the squad 's regular starting midfielders and the competition 's top goal-getter , striker david villa .
such was spain 's dominance that even fifa 's notoriously obscure mathematical formula for determining world rankings could not be thrown off track .
spain earned 1663 points , almost three hundred better than 1381 racked up by second-placed germany - the team spain beat in the final in vienna to earn the euro 2008 title .
satisfied bridesmaids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's young and old had a lot to celebrate , too germany fell short in that title match - the game was n't as close as the 1-nil final scoreline would usually imply - but team potentates are still happy with the squad 's 2008 performance .
in his end-of-the-year statement last week , the president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , said germany had enjoyed a successful 2008 , pointing out that his organized had invested in the future by building 1,000 new playing fields .
with germany also well on their way to qualifying for the next world cup , the only dark cloud on the horizon was the nasty public spat between national coach joachim loew and veteran midfielders michael ballack and torsten frings .
this autumn , after frings was left out of the lineup for a couple of germany 's matches , ballack publically accused loew of lacking respect for older players .
all parties insist the conflict has been resolved , which is probably true - for now .
risers and fallers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's fans can cheer the fact that their team is in the top 10 the netherlands , which also had a strong euro 2008 , were ranked third , just behind germany and above 2006 world cup winners italy , who mounted an uninspired campaign this summer in switzerland and austria .
turkey also managed to crack the top ten , overtaking traditional soccer powers france , portugal and the czech republic .
croatia and russia are at seventh and ninth respectively , reflecting their good euro 2008 performances .
the highest-ranked non-european team is brazil in fifth - a position that almost amounts to insult for the once-mighty selecao .
still , brazil football fanatics can take solace in the fact that the squad is still one place above hated rivals argentina .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2008 europeans disagree drastically on fed rate cut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has plunged against against the euro for some it was the right thing at the right time ; for others the end of the financial world as we know it .
the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "

" no one in the -lrb- ruling coalition -rrb- government seems to give any thought as to where to promote savings . " fricke 's estimate is higher than information provided to the sueddeutsche zeitung by unnamed internal government sources , the paper reported in its wednesday edition . over budget by more than 30 billion euros a spokesman at the finance ministry would not confirm the paper 's estimate putting new debt for 2009 at 30 billion euros . official debt projected by the finance ministry for next year had been put at 18.5 billion euros based on estimated tax revenues and an economic growth rate of 0.2 percent in 2009 . but on tuesday , ministry officials had revised their estimates and said the german economy could contract by as much as 3.0 percent next year , meaning a loss of some 15 billion euros for the federal coffers , according to fricke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto fricke slammed the government for its unrealistic budget projections in addition , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government had estimated that the budget for unemployment benefits would be reduced in 2009 compared to this year in spite of the world economic crisis that has adversely affected not only the banking sector , but also the automobile industry . increased spending in 2009 " that is totally unrealistic , " fricke told the afp news agency of the government 's projections . " i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor . " when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .
wind and solar power are expected to play a greater role , as are bio-fuels , but the gap between europe 's energy reality and the future it foresees remains daunting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .

the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .
wind and solar power are expected to play a greater role , as are bio-fuels , but the gap between europe 's energy reality and the future it foresees remains daunting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .
wind and solar power are expected to play a greater role , as are bio-fuels , but the gap between europe 's energy reality and the future it foresees remains daunting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .

" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2008 europeans disagree drastically on fed rate cut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has plunged against against the euro for some it was the right thing at the right time ; for others the end of the financial world as we know it .
the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.12.2008 protesting greek youths take message to acropolis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was something new to see at the parthenon more than a week after the police shooting of a 15-year-old , young people in greece continue anti-government demonstrations .
they briefly hijacked radio and tv stations - as well the country 's most famous monument . at the parthenon on acropolis hill , young demonstrators unfurled two huge banners , one of which featured the word " resistance " written in greek , english , and other languages .
the other called for protestors across the country to continue their marches .
sit-ins continued at schools and universities on wednesday , dec .
17 .
protest leaders say around 600 educational institutions are currently being occupied while authorities put the number at around 100 .
early on wednesday morning , gas bombs exploded in front of a bank and at least one office building in thessaloniki , greece 's second-largest city .
the buildings were damaged , but there were no initial reports of any serious injuries .
making -lrb- air -rrb- waves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death of alexis grigoropoulos sparked the unrest on tuesday evening , in what may be a change from the strategy of directly confronting greek police , demonstrators briefly took over several radio and tv broadcasters , reading out statements critical of the government .
at the state television station net , around 10 young protestors succeeded in interrupting a televised speech by greek prime minister konstantinos karamanlis .
they held up banners reading " stop watching and take to the streets " and " free all who have been taken into to custody . "
the station then switched over to advertising , and the youths vacated the building .
unemployment anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this christmas season in greece has been unhappy , to say the least between 300 and 500 protestors have been arrested in the week of rioting following the fatal shooting by greek police of a 15-year-old on december 6 .

despite having gone 44 years without a major title , the spaniards made short work of the competition at this summer 's european championship in austria and switzerland .
the only blemish on their record , if one wants to call it that , was their victory on penalties over italy .
otherwise the team won all its matches in regulation time - both at the euro 2008 and in qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
no fewer than nine of its players were selected for the euro 2008 team of the tournament , including all four of the squad 's regular starting midfielders and the competition 's top goal-getter , striker david villa .
such was spain 's dominance that even fifa 's notoriously obscure mathematical formula for determining world rankings could not be thrown off track .

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law . " he said the law bans " bans terrorist acts which blindly target civilians such as attacks and rocket firing against israel " as well " any form of collective punishment " referring to the harsh israeli measures against the people of gaza in response to rocket attacks . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 . " the second economic stimulus package will generate new debts in the order of 50 billion euros , " fricke told national daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" no one in the -lrb- ruling coalition -rrb- government seems to give any thought as to where to promote savings . " fricke 's estimate is higher than information provided to the sueddeutsche zeitung by unnamed internal government sources , the paper reported in its wednesday edition . over budget by more than 30 billion euros a spokesman at the finance ministry would not confirm the paper 's estimate putting new debt for 2009 at 30 billion euros . official debt projected by the finance ministry for next year had been put at 18.5 billion euros based on estimated tax revenues and an economic growth rate of 0.2 percent in 2009 . but on tuesday , ministry officials had revised their estimates and said the german economy could contract by as much as 3.0 percent next year , meaning a loss of some 15 billion euros for the federal coffers , according to fricke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto fricke slammed the government for its unrealistic budget projections in addition , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government had estimated that the budget for unemployment benefits would be reduced in 2009 compared to this year in spite of the world economic crisis that has adversely affected not only the banking sector , but also the automobile industry . increased spending in 2009 " that is totally unrealistic , " fricke told the afp news agency of the government 's projections . " i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor .

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law .

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 17.12.2008 europeans disagree drastically on fed rate cut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar has plunged against against the euro for some it was the right thing at the right time ; for others the end of the financial world as we know it .
the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "
deutsche bank shares were down as much as 9 percent during the course of wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 . " the second economic stimulus package will generate new debts in the order of 50 billion euros , " fricke told national daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" no one in the -lrb- ruling coalition -rrb- government seems to give any thought as to where to promote savings . " fricke 's estimate is higher than information provided to the sueddeutsche zeitung by unnamed internal government sources , the paper reported in its wednesday edition . over budget by more than 30 billion euros a spokesman at the finance ministry would not confirm the paper 's estimate putting new debt for 2009 at 30 billion euros . official debt projected by the finance ministry for next year had been put at 18.5 billion euros based on estimated tax revenues and an economic growth rate of 0.2 percent in 2009 . but on tuesday , ministry officials had revised their estimates and said the german economy could contract by as much as 3.0 percent next year , meaning a loss of some 15 billion euros for the federal coffers , according to fricke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto fricke slammed the government for its unrealistic budget projections in addition , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government had estimated that the budget for unemployment benefits would be reduced in 2009 compared to this year in spite of the world economic crisis that has adversely affected not only the banking sector , but also the automobile industry . increased spending in 2009 " that is totally unrealistic , " fricke told the afp news agency of the government 's projections . " i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor . " when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .

how could it have been otherwise in a year in which la seleccion won all of their matches ? the world 's governing football authority made the announcement at its headquarters in zurich on wednesday , dec .
17 , honoring what has to be considered one of the most dominant national squads in the history of the sport .
despite having gone 44 years without a major title , the spaniards made short work of the competition at this summer 's european championship in austria and switzerland .
the only blemish on their record , if one wants to call it that , was their victory on penalties over italy .
otherwise the team won all its matches in regulation time - both at the euro 2008 and in qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
no fewer than nine of its players were selected for the euro 2008 team of the tournament , including all four of the squad 's regular starting midfielders and the competition 's top goal-getter , striker david villa .
such was spain 's dominance that even fifa 's notoriously obscure mathematical formula for determining world rankings could not be thrown off track .
spain earned 1663 points , almost three hundred better than 1381 racked up by second-placed germany - the team spain beat in the final in vienna to earn the euro 2008 title .

in his end-of-the-year statement last week , the president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , said germany had enjoyed a successful 2008 , pointing out that his organized had invested in the future by building 1,000 new playing fields .
with germany also well on their way to qualifying for the next world cup , the only dark cloud on the horizon was the nasty public spat between national coach joachim loew and veteran midfielders michael ballack and torsten frings .
this autumn , after frings was left out of the lineup for a couple of germany 's matches , ballack publically accused loew of lacking respect for older players .
all parties insist the conflict has been resolved , which is probably true - for now .
risers and fallers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's fans can cheer the fact that their team is in the top 10 the netherlands , which also had a strong euro 2008 , were ranked third , just behind germany and above 2006 world cup winners italy , who mounted an uninspired campaign this summer in switzerland and austria .
turkey also managed to crack the top ten , overtaking traditional soccer powers france , portugal and the czech republic .
croatia and russia are at seventh and ninth respectively , reflecting their good euro 2008 performances .
the highest-ranked non-european team is brazil in fifth - a position that almost amounts to insult for the once-mighty selecao .
still , brazil football fanatics can take solace in the fact that the squad is still one place above hated rivals argentina .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .
wind and solar power are expected to play a greater role , as are bio-fuels , but the gap between europe 's energy reality and the future it foresees remains daunting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .

the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .

the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .

britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .
wind and solar power are expected to play a greater role , as are bio-fuels , but the gap between europe 's energy reality and the future it foresees remains daunting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

protest leaders say around 600 educational institutions are currently being occupied while authorities put the number at around 100 .

the anger among largely left-wing young people in greece has been fueled by what many see as the lack of economic opportunity in the country .
the official greek unemployment figure is 9 percent and rising , and some one-fifth of the population lives below the poverty line . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "
deutsche bank shares were down as much as 9 percent during the course of wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite having gone 44 years without a major title , the spaniards made short work of the competition at this summer 's european championship in austria and switzerland .
the only blemish on their record , if one wants to call it that , was their victory on penalties over italy .
otherwise the team won all its matches in regulation time - both at the euro 2008 and in qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
no fewer than nine of its players were selected for the euro 2008 team of the tournament , including all four of the squad 's regular starting midfielders and the competition 's top goal-getter , striker david villa .
such was spain 's dominance that even fifa 's notoriously obscure mathematical formula for determining world rankings could not be thrown off track .

with germany also well on their way to qualifying for the next world cup , the only dark cloud on the horizon was the nasty public spat between national coach joachim loew and veteran midfielders michael ballack and torsten frings .
this autumn , after frings was left out of the lineup for a couple of germany 's matches , ballack publically accused loew of lacking respect for older players .
all parties insist the conflict has been resolved , which is probably true - for now .

turkey also managed to crack the top ten , overtaking traditional soccer powers france , portugal and the czech republic .
croatia and russia are at seventh and ninth respectively , reflecting their good euro 2008 performances .
the highest-ranked non-european team is brazil in fifth - a position that almost amounts to insult for the once-mighty selecao .

despite having gone 44 years without a major title , the spaniards made short work of the competition at this summer 's european championship in austria and switzerland .
the only blemish on their record , if one wants to call it that , was their victory on penalties over italy .
otherwise the team won all its matches in regulation time - both at the euro 2008 and in qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
no fewer than nine of its players were selected for the euro 2008 team of the tournament , including all four of the squad 's regular starting midfielders and the competition 's top goal-getter , striker david villa .
such was spain 's dominance that even fifa 's notoriously obscure mathematical formula for determining world rankings could not be thrown off track .

with germany also well on their way to qualifying for the next world cup , the only dark cloud on the horizon was the nasty public spat between national coach joachim loew and veteran midfielders michael ballack and torsten frings .

turkey also managed to crack the top ten , overtaking traditional soccer powers france , portugal and the czech republic .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east .

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating . " the responsibility for a resolution of the middle east conflict does not just fall to israel and the palestinians though they must lead the process , " miliband noted in his remarks . " it falls to every state in the region , for the only sustainable peace must be a 23-state solution , not just a two-state solution - 22 arab states and israel living side by side in security , " he added . france 's un ambassador jean-maurice ripert insisted on the " absolute necessity to respect humanitarian law . " he said the law bans " bans terrorist acts which blindly target civilians such as attacks and rocket firing against israel " as well " any form of collective punishment " referring to the harsh israeli measures against the people of gaza in response to rocket attacks . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 17.12.2008 britain 's brown announces full troop withdrawal from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi soldiers will fill the void left by uk troops who leave basra by the end of july .
during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .
troop withdrawal allows uk to focus on afghanistan iraq 's maliki also added that the agreement included a provision that allows a few hundred british military advisors to remain in place to help the iraqi government adjust to the troop withdrawal .
britain 's withdrawal from iraq is expected to help it focus on afghanistan , where taliban insurgents are stepping up violent attacks .
the british military has said it will immediately divert helicopters from iraq to afghanistan , helping to transport its 8,300 troops based there around the battlefield . sustaining military operations in both countries has become nearly impossible with an overstretched army , according to british defense ministry sources .
the draft law setting out the terms for the withdrawal of british forces from iraq also covers the remaining australian , estonian , romanian , salvadoran and nato troops , and needs to be approved by the iraqi parliament . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during a visit to baghdad , british pm gordon brown announced that the remaining 4,100 troops stationed in basra will head home by summer .
this will allow the uk to focus more on afghanistan . in his fourth trip to baghdad as british prime minister , gordon brown announced that uk forces will be leaving iraq by july 2009 .
brown was in iraq on wednesday , dec .
17 , to meet with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki , a day after the iraqi government drafted a law paving the way for the troop withdrawal next year and six years after the britain joined in the us-led invasion .
" the role played by the uk combat forces is drawing to a close .
these forces will have completed their tasks in the first half of 2009 and will then leave iraq , " brown and al-maliki said in a joint statement , followed by a press conference .
at its peak , britain had 45,000 troops stationed in iraq , but huge public opposition to the unpopular war at home led the government to reduce combat operations .
now over 4,000 british troops are serving in the southern iraqi region of basra , where brown is headed after the impromptu baghdad visit .
iraqis take on bigger role in fighting insurgents the troop withdrawal announcement comes in the immediate aftermath of twin bomb attacks in baghdad that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores of others , as a bloody reminder of the terrorist attacks that have been endemic for years in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks still occur in baghdad , but are diminishing most of the countries in the what us president george bush has coined as the " coalition of the willing " have left iraq as the violence has eased , and iraqi police and soldiers assume a greater role for fighting the remaining insurgents .
the draft law is similar to a " status of forces " pact which iraq had previously signed with the us , which allows some 140,000 forces to remain until the end of 2011 , but stipulates a troop withdrawal from iraqi cities by june .
once british troops pull out , a substantial us contingent is expect to be stationed in the south to oversee security operations and training of iraqi security forces .
all british troops coming home by end of july at the press conference , brown outlined the planned british withdrawal .
" we have agreed today that the -lrb- combat -rrb- mission will end no later that may 31 next year .
our troops will be coming home two months -lrb- later -rrb- .
" the biggest reduction -lrb- in troops -rrb- will be at the end part of the period we are talking about , " he said .
brown added that britain 's work in iraq is now done and that the country 's main oil fields in the south are now safely in the hands of iraqi security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown , right , wants to shift focus to afghanistan " they 've done some of the most difficult work ... building a democracy for the future and defending it against terrorism , " brown said of the estimated 100,000 british soldiers who have served in iraq since 2003 .
the partnership between britain and iraq will continue and take on new dimensions though .
for one , the british-iraqi basra development commission says there are plans for at least $ 9 billion in oil-related investments in the southern region in upcoming years .

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .

they briefly hijacked radio and tv stations - as well the country 's most famous monument . at the parthenon on acropolis hill , young demonstrators unfurled two huge banners , one of which featured the word " resistance " written in greek , english , and other languages .
the other called for protestors across the country to continue their marches .

protest leaders say around 600 educational institutions are currently being occupied while authorities put the number at around 100 .

the station then switched over to advertising , and the youths vacated the building .

the unrest is the worst greece has seen in decades , with the damage in the greek capital athens alone being estimated at more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 281 million -rrb- .
the anger among largely left-wing young people in greece has been fueled by what many see as the lack of economic opportunity in the country .
the official greek unemployment figure is 9 percent and rising , and some one-fifth of the population lives below the poverty line . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .

but with israel headed for elections and palestine instability increasing , the talks are in danger of falling apart . for the first time in five years , the un security council voted to throw its weight behind the ongoing middle east peace process .
the 14-0 vote on tuesday , dec .
16 was a strong show of support for negotiations between israelis and palestinians . it brought out diplomatic heavy hitters like us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her counterparts sergey lavrov of russia and david miliband of britain . " a palestinian state is long overdue , " rice said in an address to the council before the vote .
she urged the two sides to take political and security steps to arrive at a full-fledged palestinian state . yet the reality is that one year into renewed peace talks , they are in danger of falling apart .
the un resolution is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the talks on track in face of ongoing instability in the palestinian territories and a likely return of the hard-line likud party in israel next year . negotiations are " irreversible " the security council resolution was worked out by the united states and russia , two of the quartet on diplomacy for the middle east , which has been working for years to find an end to the conflict . the other parties in the quartet are the united nations and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said a palestinian state is " long overdue " the resolution declared the council 's support for the initiative from the middle east peace conference held in annapolis , maryland , in november , 2007 , and " its commitment to the irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations . " it urged an intensification of the diplomatic efforts to achieve a " comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the middle east . " elections could pose new hurdles the foreign ministers attended the quartet meeting on monday to call on israel and the palestinians to move forward quickly to a settlement of the conflict . yet problems remain on both sides . many israelis oppose withdrawing from occupied lands .
two out of every three israelis said they would oppose such a move , in a survey released tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is a destabilizing factor furthermore , israel is heading into an election in february .
the new israeli government will most likely be headed by benjamin netanyahu , who has been critical of the government 's handling of negotiations and would likely not support israel giving up its settlements on the west bank . palestinian president mahmoud abbas has indicated he might call for elections in the middle of 2009 .
there is a real possibility that both will be won by the radical islamic hamas movement , which refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist and with whom israel refuses to negotiate . us president george w. bush , who had hoped to achieve a settlement before he leaves office in january , no longer believes that the goal is realistic , a spokesman said . it definitely seems unlikely that a settlement will be reached by the end of december , un secretary-general ban ki-moon acknowledged . but ban urged both sides to " ensure that what has been started is seen all the way through to its conclusion , " ban said . europe will continue its involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of barriers to peace remain miliband urged israel and palestine to continue negotiating .

european lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change .
being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever , the next challenge will be implementation . the legislative package , which easily passed the european parliament after being put forward by last week 's summit of the eu 's 27 member states , mandates a 20 percent reduction in the eu 's 1990 levels of co emissions by the year 2020 .
the bloc hopes to achieve that goal by enforcing stricter standards for motor vehicle and factory emissions and by increasing energy efficiency in general .
at the heart of the effort is an emission trading scheme in which industry would be required in essence to buy permits to emit pollutants .
the package also mandates that the amount of energy the eu derives from renewable sources , currently at seven percent , be increased to 20 percent by 2020 .
the deal is being touted as a crucial prelude to next year 's international climate conference in copenhagen , at which leaders hope to reach an international agreement .
many see the change in the us government next january as further cause for optimism .
" everybody knows what mr. obama has set as priorities - energy security and climate change , " european environment commissioner stavros dimas said in the debate preceding the european parliament vote on wednesday , december 17 .
but the eu 's deal itself contains a number of compromises .
coal and cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in future , europeans will have to pay to pollute to get the deal passed , the bloc was forced to make concessions to many of the eu 's newer , formerly communist , eastern european member states , which are still highly dependent on coal power .
as a compromise , states such as poland will get roughly 12 percent of the revenues generated by the emission trading scheme .
automakers also lobbied for and won more time to be able to meet stricter climate standards .
the deal 's 18 percent cut in maximum allowable co2 emissions for new cars will take effect in 2015 - three years later than the date proponents had originally hoped for .
and it is unclear whether the eu will be able to meet its ambitious target for renewable-energy use .
wind and solar power are expected to play a greater role , as are bio-fuels , but the gap between europe 's energy reality and the future it foresees remains daunting . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .
" it 's being speculated that deutsche bank could soon announce serious losses , " reuters quoted an unnamed trader as saying .
" this rumor is being passed along on the market . "
deutsche bank shares were down as much as 9 percent during the course of wednesday . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us federal reserve 's decision to slash interest rates to near zero has europeans scratching their heads . the most immediate and unambiguous reaction on wednesday , dec .
17 , to the fed 's decision came on currency markets .
as the european business day closed , the euro was up by more than 3 cents , or 2 percent , against the dollar .
the us decision to reduce the prime rate to between 0 and 0.2 percent is a double-edged sword for europeans .
if the move increases american consumer demand and stimulates the global economy , it could help europe 's struggling industries .
but a weak dollar could also make it even harder for europe 's exporting nations , led by germany , to sell their products on the world 's biggest market .
" the economy … is stuck in heavy recession and can hardly cope with the additional burden on its competitiveness cause by rising exchange rates , " wrote the daily german business newspaper handelsblatt .
but german labor greeted the fed 's tuesday decision and said europe - where the rate is currently 2.5 percent - needed to follow suit .
" we hope that the european central bank will also shake itself awake and reduce interest rates by a further half of a percentage point , " the chairman of the german association of unions , claus matecki , told reuters news agency .
uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben barnanke 's reputation could ride on this decision economists held likewise mixed opinions over the federal reserve 's move to reduce interest rates to the lowest point in the institution 's 95-year history .
" it 's the right decision in light of the rapid fall in economic output , " said the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter .
" but you should n't expect immediate results - as always it will probably be a year before it has an effect on the economy . "
but other analysts were n't so sanguine .
" the federal reserve has used up its ammunition , " said michael heise , chief economist at the allianz bank .
" now , we have to hope it works . "
and others saw the move as a sign that the fed was acting in desperation and abandoning decades of conventional economic wisdom .
" ultimately , it means the fed is pursuing monetary policy via printing more currency , " bernd weidensteiner , an america expert at the commerzbank , told dpa news agency .
" reducing the prime interest rate has become blunt instrument . "
switzerland 's leading daily newspaper , the neue zuercher zeitung , concurred .
" the fed 's leadership is like a computer administrator who , growing ever more impatient and frustrated , starts sending stronger and stronger jolts of power through the system - even though some of the wires have already melted . "
investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reacted to the fed 's decision with another glum shrug the fed 's decision sent share prices on wall street higher on tuesday , after the move became known .
but european investors did n't share that optimism .
two of europe 's largest markets - germany 's dax and france 's cac 40 - were recording slight losses in late-afternoon trading .
in germany , banking shares were among the day 's biggest losers .
the dow jones also got off to a bad start on wednesday as investors reacted to more bad news , including record losses by investment giant morgan stanley and uncertainty about the scope of the fallout from the alleged madoff pyramid scheme .
and further doom and gloom from europe could be on the horizon .

" no one in the -lrb- ruling coalition -rrb- government seems to give any thought as to where to promote savings . " fricke 's estimate is higher than information provided to the sueddeutsche zeitung by unnamed internal government sources , the paper reported in its wednesday edition . over budget by more than 30 billion euros a spokesman at the finance ministry would not confirm the paper 's estimate putting new debt for 2009 at 30 billion euros . official debt projected by the finance ministry for next year had been put at 18.5 billion euros based on estimated tax revenues and an economic growth rate of 0.2 percent in 2009 . but on tuesday , ministry officials had revised their estimates and said the german economy could contract by as much as 3.0 percent next year , meaning a loss of some 15 billion euros for the federal coffers , according to fricke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto fricke slammed the government for its unrealistic budget projections in addition , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government had estimated that the budget for unemployment benefits would be reduced in 2009 compared to this year in spite of the world economic crisis that has adversely affected not only the banking sector , but also the automobile industry . increased spending in 2009 " that is totally unrealistic , " fricke told the afp news agency of the government 's projections . " i see a hole of 4 billion euros . " additional expenses related to health care investments and a much debated commuter tax break are among the unexpected expenditures that are estimated to cost the government over 10 billion euros next year , the sueddeutsche reported . the government also wants to compensate for the loss of jobs in private industry by increased federal spending to create jobs .
on tuesday , merkel told business leaders that the government plans to invest billions in long term infrastructure projects , such as renovating state schools , providing broadband communication networks in rural areas and taking on energy conservation measures , such insulating rental homes in order to bring down heating costs . wait-and-see approach until obama takes office the german government , however , wants to wait until us president-elect barack obama takes office before deciding on which measures germany would take to stimulate the economy and deal with the looming budget deficit . financial experts in merkel 's own party expressed doubts that the government will keep the hole in federal budget from expanding and heaped criticism on the chancellor . " when the government follows a clear path , the increase in new debt can be contained .

how could it have been otherwise in a year in which la seleccion won all of their matches ? the world 's governing football authority made the announcement at its headquarters in zurich on wednesday , dec .
17 , honoring what has to be considered one of the most dominant national squads in the history of the sport .
despite having gone 44 years without a major title , the spaniards made short work of the competition at this summer 's european championship in austria and switzerland .
the only blemish on their record , if one wants to call it that , was their victory on penalties over italy .
otherwise the team won all its matches in regulation time - both at the euro 2008 and in qualifying for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
no fewer than nine of its players were selected for the euro 2008 team of the tournament , including all four of the squad 's regular starting midfielders and the competition 's top goal-getter , striker david villa .
such was spain 's dominance that even fifa 's notoriously obscure mathematical formula for determining world rankings could not be thrown off track .
spain earned 1663 points , almost three hundred better than 1381 racked up by second-placed germany - the team spain beat in the final in vienna to earn the euro 2008 title .
satisfied bridesmaids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's young and old had a lot to celebrate , too germany fell short in that title match - the game was n't as close as the 1-nil final scoreline would usually imply - but team potentates are still happy with the squad 's 2008 performance .
in his end-of-the-year statement last week , the president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , theo zwanziger , said germany had enjoyed a successful 2008 , pointing out that his organized had invested in the future by building 1,000 new playing fields .
with germany also well on their way to qualifying for the next world cup , the only dark cloud on the horizon was the nasty public spat between national coach joachim loew and veteran midfielders michael ballack and torsten frings .
this autumn , after frings was left out of the lineup for a couple of germany 's matches , ballack publically accused loew of lacking respect for older players .
all parties insist the conflict has been resolved , which is probably true - for now .
risers and fallers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's fans can cheer the fact that their team is in the top 10 the netherlands , which also had a strong euro 2008 , were ranked third , just behind germany and above 2006 world cup winners italy , who mounted an uninspired campaign this summer in switzerland and austria .
turkey also managed to crack the top ten , overtaking traditional soccer powers france , portugal and the czech republic .
croatia and russia are at seventh and ninth respectively , reflecting their good euro 2008 performances .
the highest-ranked non-european team is brazil in fifth - a position that almost amounts to insult for the once-mighty selecao .
still , brazil football fanatics can take solace in the fact that the squad is still one place above hated rivals argentina .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- obesity - what 's in a word ?

viewpoint by sir liam donaldson chief medical officer for england six years ago , sir liam donaldson described the " obesity timebomb " facing the uk .
but in this week 's scrubbing up , england 's chief medical officer argues many people are still failing to deal with the realities of the obesity problem . "
i first warned about the " obesity timebomb " in my 2002 annual report , pointing to the increasing number of children and adults who weigh much more than previous generations .
i said then that there would be serious implications for the country 's future health if the problem continued to grow unchecked .
for the individual , being seriously overweight increases their risk of developing or dying from cancer , heart disease , diabetes and some other illnesses .
it reduces quality of life and well-being . "
' obesity ' has become the new ' cancer ' - a word that is taboo , that intimidates , that strikes fear , that promotes softer euphemisms " read your comments for society , there are also major implications in greater health service demand , lost industrial productivity and increased incapacity benefit payments .
the estimated cost to the national economy is £ 15 billion .
the publicity for my " timebomb " scenario was huge , and a 2004 evaluation of media coverage of my reports showed obesity became a bigger issue than either smoking or the mmr vaccine - both " hot topics " .
since then , obesity has hardly been out of the media whether in news stories , weight loss and exercise campaigns , feature articles , agony columns , surveys .
in any other field , this would be a publicist 's dream , but traditionally health education programmes have tried to tightly control messages and information .
iconic images the obesity story has not stayed in its box .
it has run and run , but it has also provoked soul-searching .
how much should we spend on school meals ?
are parents of obese children bad parents ?
what are the limits and responsibilities of the state in taking action ?
what is the place for banning things ?
should fat patients go to the back of the queue for nhs treatment ? "
i felt like the manager in the half-time dressing room at st james 's park on a bad day " iconic stories and images have emerged : jamie oliver getting rotherham cooking , mothers pushing meat pies through the school railings , people so desperate to lose weight that they opt for stomach stapling operations .
the electronic database of published medical journal articles -lrb- pubmed -rrb- shows just over 114,000 on the subject of obesity over the last nearly 30 years .
this headline figure conceals an important trend .
at the beginning of the 1980s , the figure was around 1,200 , by the beginning of this decade it was over 4,000 and last year it had risen above 10,000 medical articles .
what does this mean ?
medical research priorities often reflect public concern about the seriousness of a disease .
obesity used to be the interest only of specialists .
it has moved from the professional to the personal and the political .
strong opinions today , the word obesity arouses deep feelings and provokes strong opinions .
it influences in ways that ca n't always be predicted .
a couple of years ago i was at a meeting to discuss action on obesity .
the meeting was downbeat and people said very little .
i was annoyed : " where are the ideas ? " , " where is your enthusiasm ? " , " why ca n't we rise to the challenge " i asked them .
i felt like the manager in the half-time dressing room at st james 's park on a bad day . "
the obesity epidemic is a national crisis - doing nothing is not an option " after the meeting broke up , one person crept back into the room and whispered to me : " we could n't talk about it properly because someone obese was in the room . "
dividing someone 's weight by the square of their height produces the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- .
a bmi between 18.5 and 25 is a healthy weight , 25 to 30 is overweight , while anything over 30 is ' obese ' .
' labelled for life ' recently , we were planning the results letter to parents following the national child measurement programme .
the purpose of this initiative is to monitor children 's health and well-being and aims to make parents aware of any potential problems with their child 's weight so that they can seek professional help if needed .
such data is also essential to track the problem at population level and target action appropriately .
scrubbing up the bbc news website is launching the " scrubbing up " weekly column , where leading clinicians and experts give their perspectives on issues in health each week , you will be able to have your say the stumbling block became the wording of the feedback letter to individual parents .
at an earlier stage some child health professionals had argued against the idea of a school-based weighing and measuring scheme because it would stigmatise overweight or obese children and lead to them being bullied .
when the letter was field-tested with parents in focus group interviews there was a clear message that the term " obese " was unpopular .
they felt they were being personally blamed for their child 's health , and that their child would be " labelled for life " .
the majority of these parents felt that using the term " very overweight " in combination with the associated health risks was a better approach .
the ' o ' word suddenly , having been walking on a firm path , we had stepped on to eggshells .
some argued that the views of the focus-group parents should predominate : from now on it should always be " very overweight " .
others felt that this was colluding with a form of denial and the real problem was that some parents were not facing up to or engaging with the need to act .
" obesity " has become the new " cancer " .
a word that is taboo , that intimidates , that strikes fear , that promotes softer euphemisms .
in effect it has become an " o " word .
the gurus of change management often speak of the need for everyone to recognise a state of crisis in order to take action .
they use the metaphor of a burning platform .
perhaps the word " obesity " is itself that burning platform .
precisely because body size has become a personal , social and political issue , the use and meaning of words to describe it is important .
we can not afford to alienate parents .
they need to be engaged and active in helping to solve the problem .

viewpoint by sir liam donaldson chief medical officer for england in england almost two-thirds of adults are either overweight or obese six years ago , sir liam donaldson described the " obesity timebomb " facing the uk .
but in this week 's scrubbing up , england 's chief medical officer argues many people are still failing to deal with the realities of the obesity problem .
i first warned about the " obesity timebomb " in my 2002 annual report , pointing to the increasing number of children and adults who weigh much more than previous generations .
i said then that there would be serious implications for the country 's future health if the problem continued to grow unchecked .
for the individual , being seriously overweight increases their risk of developing or dying from cancer , heart disease , diabetes and some other illnesses .
it reduces quality of life and well-being .
' obesity ' has become the new ' cancer ' - a word that is taboo , that intimidates , that strikes fear , that promotes softer euphemisms read your comments for society , there are also major implications in greater health service demand , lost industrial productivity and increased incapacity benefit payments .
the estimated cost to the national economy is £ 15 billion .
the publicity for my " timebomb " scenario was huge , and a 2004 evaluation of media coverage of my reports showed obesity became a bigger issue than either smoking or the mmr vaccine - both " hot topics " .
since then , obesity has hardly been out of the media whether in news stories , weight loss and exercise campaigns , feature articles , agony columns , surveys .
in any other field , this would be a publicist 's dream , but traditionally health education programmes have tried to tightly control messages and information .
iconic images the obesity story has not stayed in its box .
it has run and run , but it has also provoked soul-searching .
how much should we spend on school meals ?
are parents of obese children bad parents ?
what are the limits and responsibilities of the state in taking action ?
what is the place for banning things ?
should fat patients go to the back of the queue for nhs treatment ?
i felt like the manager in the half-time dressing room at st james 's park on a bad day iconic stories and images have emerged : jamie oliver getting rotherham cooking , mothers pushing meat pies through the school railings , people so desperate to lose weight that they opt for stomach stapling operations .
the electronic database of published medical journal articles -lrb- pubmed -rrb- shows just over 114,000 on the subject of obesity over the last nearly 30 years .

mum amanda broomhall believes we should use the word obese this headline figure conceals an important trend .
at the beginning of the 1980s , the figure was around 1,200 , by the beginning of this decade it was over 4,000 and last year it had risen above 10,000 medical articles .
what does this mean ?
medical research priorities often reflect public concern about the seriousness of a disease .
obesity used to be the interest only of specialists .
it has moved from the professional to the personal and the political .
strong opinions today , the word obesity arouses deep feelings and provokes strong opinions .
it influences in ways that ca n't always be predicted .
a couple of years ago i was at a meeting to discuss action on obesity .
the meeting was downbeat and people said very little .
i was annoyed : " where are the ideas ? " , " where is your enthusiasm ? " , " why ca n't we rise to the challenge " i asked them .
i felt like the manager in the half-time dressing room at st james 's park on a bad day .
the obesity epidemic is a national crisis - doing nothing is not an option after the meeting broke up , one person crept back into the room and whispered to me : " we could n't talk about it properly because someone obese was in the room . "
dividing someone 's weight by the square of their height produces the body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- .
a bmi between 18.5 and 25 is a healthy weight , 25 to 30 is overweight , while anything over 30 is ' obese ' .
' labelled for life ' recently , we were planning the results letter to parents following the national child measurement programme .
the purpose of this initiative is to monitor children 's health and well-being and aims to make parents aware of any potential problems with their child 's weight so that they can seek professional help if needed .
such data is also essential to track the problem at population level and target action appropriately .
scrubbing up the bbc news website is launching the " scrubbing up " weekly column , where leading clinicians and experts give their perspectives on issues in health each week , you will be able to have your say the stumbling block became the wording of the feedback letter to individual parents .
at an earlier stage some child health professionals had argued against the idea of a school-based weighing and measuring scheme because it would stigmatise overweight or obese children and lead to them being bullied .
when the letter was field-tested with parents in focus group interviews there was a clear message that the term " obese " was unpopular .
they felt they were being personally blamed for their child 's health , and that their child would be " labelled for life " .
the majority of these parents felt that using the term " very overweight " in combination with the associated health risks was a better approach .
the ' o ' word suddenly , having been walking on a firm path , we had stepped on to eggshells .
some argued that the views of the focus-group parents should predominate : from now on it should always be " very overweight " .
others felt that this was colluding with a form of denial and the real problem was that some parents were not facing up to or engaging with the need to act .
" obesity " has become the new " cancer " .
a word that is taboo , that intimidates , that strikes fear , that promotes softer euphemisms .
in effect it has become an " o " word .
the gurus of change management often speak of the need for everyone to recognise a state of crisis in order to take action .
they use the metaphor of a burning platform .
perhaps the word " obesity " is itself that burning platform .
precisely because body size has become a personal , social and political issue , the use and meaning of words to describe it is important .
we can not afford to alienate parents .
they need to be engaged and active in helping to solve the problem .
on the other hand , the obesity epidemic is a national crisis .
doing nothing is not an option .

viewpoint by sir liam donaldson chief medical officer for england in england almost two-thirds of adults are either overweight or obese six years ago , sir liam donaldson described the " obesity timebomb " facing the uk .
but in this week 's scrubbing up , england 's chief medical officer argues many people are still failing to deal with the realities of the obesity problem .
i first warned about the " obesity timebomb " in my 2002 annual report , pointing to the increasing number of children and adults who weigh much more than previous generations .
i said then that there would be serious implications for the country 's future health if the problem continued to grow unchecked .
for the individual , being seriously overweight increases their risk of developing or dying from cancer , heart disease , diabetes and some other illnesses .
it reduces quality of life and well-being .
' obesity ' has become the new ' cancer ' - a word that is taboo , that intimidates , that strikes fear , that promotes softer euphemisms read your comments for society , there are also major implications in greater health service demand , lost industrial productivity and increased incapacity benefit payments .
the estimated cost to the national economy is £ 15 billion .
the publicity for my " timebomb " scenario was huge , and a 2004 evaluation of media coverage of my reports showed obesity became a bigger issue than either smoking or the mmr vaccine - both " hot topics " .
since then , obesity has hardly been out of the media whether in news stories , weight loss and exercise campaigns , feature articles , agony columns , surveys .
in any other field , this would be a publicist 's dream , but traditionally health education programmes have tried to tightly control messages and information .
iconic images the obesity story has not stayed in its box .
it has run and run , but it has also provoked soul-searching .
how much should we spend on school meals ?
are parents of obese children bad parents ?
what are the limits and responsibilities of the state in taking action ?
what is the place for banning things ?
should fat patients go to the back of the queue for nhs treatment ?
i felt like the manager in the half-time dressing room at st james 's park on a bad day iconic stories and images have emerged : jamie oliver getting rotherham cooking , mothers pushing meat pies through the school railings , people so desperate to lose weight that they opt for stomach stapling operations .
the electronic database of published medical journal articles -lrb- pubmed -rrb- shows just over 114,000 on the subject of obesity over the last nearly 30 years .

the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- head , christopher cox , launched an inquiry into what he called a serious agency breakdown .
it has been revealed the sec received warnings about wall st figure bernard madoff almost 10 years ago , in 1999 .
mr madoff has been charged with fraud in one of the biggest-ever such cases .
investors , banks and charities across the world fear they may have lost billions of dollars since mr madoff 's arrest .
it is thought that mr madoff was running what was essentially the world 's largest pyramid scheme , the bbc 's andy gallacher reports from washington .
now serious questions are being asked about the sec 's role in not preventing it in the first place , our correspondent says .
' credible and specific ' the sec chairman said he was " gravely concerned by the apparent multiple failures " of sec staff to look into claims about mr madoff . "
the reason we are easy to fool in the end , is because we are so good at fooling ourselves . "
kevin connolly irrational euphoria of investors mr cox said : " credible and specific allegations regarding mr madoff 's financial wrongdoing , going back to at least 1999 , were repeatedly brought to the attention of sec staff , but were never recommended to the commission for action . "
this meant staff had to rely on data voluntarily produced by mr madoff 's firm , rather than use a subpoena to obtain information , he said .
mr madoff , who was arrested on thursday , ran a fund that paid annual interest of about 10 % but prosecutors say it was , in effect , similar to a pyramid scheme , with money from new investors paying off old ones .
the long-time wall street executive , 70 , is due to appear in court shortly for a hearing on his $ 10m bail bond .
victims of the alleged scheme include some of the world 's biggest banks , as well as hundreds of private investors .
mounting criticism the sec has been under pressure for not detecting the alleged " ponzi scheme " earlier .
what is a ponzi scheme ?
a fraudulent investment scheme paying investors from money paid in by other investors rather than real profits named after charles ponzi who notoriously used the technique in the united states in 1919-20 differs from pyramid selling in that individuals all tend to invest with the same person how madoff millions vanished how to avoid being a victim jon moulton of alchemy partners said some investors had complained about mr madoff 's scheme as early as 1999 .
" the sec did remarkably well " to avoid spotting any problems , he said .
steven bell of glc fund managers said : " apparently people reported these concerns to the sec , they highlighted them . "
" it 's almost like someone saying ' my next-door neighbour 's a burglar , go and have a check ' and they did n't , apparently , " he added .
dominique strauss-kahn , director general of the international monetary fund , also expressed shock that us regulators had failed to identify and prevent the alleged fraud .

among the potential losers is spain 's largest bank , santander , which owns the uk high street banks abbey , alliance & leicester and bradford & bingley .
japanese financial giant nomura said it could lose up to $ 303m .
some of the biggest private losers seem to have been members of the palm beach country club , where many of mr madoff 's wealthy clients were recruited .
charities appear also to have suffered such as the new york-based jeht foundation , which said it was freezing all its grants and would shut by the end of january , and film director stephen spielberg 's wunderkinder foundation charity .

the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- head , christopher cox , launched an inquiry into what he called a serious agency breakdown .
it has been revealed the sec received warnings about wall st figure bernard madoff almost 10 years ago , in 1999 .
mr madoff has been charged with fraud in one of the biggest-ever such cases .
investors , banks and charities across the world fear they may have lost billions of dollars since mr madoff 's arrest .
it is thought that mr madoff was running what was essentially the world 's largest pyramid scheme , the bbc 's andy gallacher reports from washington .
now serious questions are being asked about the sec 's role in not preventing it in the first place , our correspondent says .
' credible and specific ' the sec chairman said he was " gravely concerned by the apparent multiple failures " of sec staff to look into claims about mr madoff .
the reason we are easy to fool in the end , is because we are so good at fooling ourselves .
kevin connolly irrational euphoria of investors mr cox said : " credible and specific allegations regarding mr madoff 's financial wrongdoing , going back to at least 1999 , were repeatedly brought to the attention of sec staff , but were never recommended to the commission for action . "
this meant staff had to rely on data voluntarily produced by mr madoff 's firm , rather than use a subpoena to obtain information , he said .
mr madoff , who was arrested on thursday , ran a fund that paid annual interest of about 10 % but prosecutors say it was , in effect , similar to a pyramid scheme , with money from new investors paying off old ones .
the long-time wall street executive , 70 , is due to appear in court shortly for a hearing on his $ 10m bail bond .
victims of the alleged scheme include some of the world 's biggest banks , as well as hundreds of private investors .
mounting criticism the sec has been under pressure for not detecting the alleged " ponzi scheme " earlier .
what is a ponzi scheme ?
a fraudulent investment scheme paying investors from money paid in by other investors rather than real profits named after charles ponzi who notoriously used the technique in the united states in 1919-20 differs from pyramid selling in that individuals all tend to invest with the same person how madoff millions vanished how to avoid being a victim jon moulton of alchemy partners said some investors had complained about mr madoff 's scheme as early as 1999 .
" the sec did remarkably well " to avoid spotting any problems , he said .
steven bell of glc fund managers said : " apparently people reported these concerns to the sec , they highlighted them . "
" it 's almost like someone saying ' my next-door neighbour 's a burglar , go and have a check ' and they did n't , apparently , " he added .
dominique strauss-kahn , director general of the international monetary fund , also expressed shock that us regulators had failed to identify and prevent the alleged fraud .

japanese financial giant nomura said it could lose up to $ 303m .
some of the biggest private losers seem to have been members of the palm beach country club , where many of mr madoff 's wealthy clients were recruited .
charities appear also to have suffered such as the new york-based jeht foundation , which said it was freezing all its grants and would shut by the end of january , and film director stephen spielberg 's wunderkinder foundation charity .

" we want our leader to come back to his country .
he 's the only one who cares about our situation , " supporters said .
they urged president rene preval to keep his promise , made during his election campaign in 2006 , to allow mr aristide to return to haiti .
mr aristide was forced to flee an armed revolt in 2004 and is in south africa .
however , the us has warned that mr aristide 's return could destabilise the country .
political prisoners the demonstrations , in the capital , port-au-prince , and the country 's second largest city , cap-haitien , came on the 18th anniversary of mr aristide 's first election as president .
the peaceful protests , which were monitored by police and un peacekeepers , ended with calls for the president to let mr aristide return to haiti .
mr aristide , who maintains he was forced to step down under pressure from the us and france , has said he would shun politics and serve haiti as a citizen on his return .
the former president was ousted in a military coup in 1991 and was returned to power in 1994 , after us military intervention .
his second term in office was marred by tension over the 2000 elections , and was cut short by an armed uprising four years later .
mr preval won the presidential poll in february 2006 to become the first elected leader since mr aristide .

mr madoff recruited several clients at the palm beach country club if something sounds too good to be true , i keep reading , that must be because it is too good to be true .
it is good advice as far as it goes and it raises the question of why so many wealthy , sophisticated savers were apparently conned into believing that mr madoff had come up with an investment strategy that allowed him to pay handsome returns even when the stock market was falling .
i asked a very senior regulator about this , a man who has been involved in formulating public policy for many years , and he said the answer was depressingly simple .
people are prone to believe what they want to believe , he said , and in rising markets a kind of irrational euphoria takes hold in which we are not inclined to ask difficult questions .
human psychology the point about bernie madoff was not so much what he was selling , it was how he sold it .
on offer was a fairly standard hedge fund arrangement in which the madoff firm bought stock in a company and then hedged against the risk by striking contracts to both buy and sell shares in the company at agreed dates in the future .
in the jargon of wall street that is a " collar " .
it is perfectly legal , but it requires endless resources of luck , judgement , money and timing .
what made mr madoff unusual was the manner in which he recruited his investors .
for that he relied on a powerful but elementary piece of human psychology : the more someone tells you that you can not have something , the more you want it .
the reason we are easy to fool in the end is because we are so good at fooling ourselves membership of the madoff fund was very strictly by invitation only - merely being rich was not enough in itself .
clients were recruited through the social networks of which mr madoff and his wife were themselves members - many were jewish new yorkers who spent part of the year in florida .
others came across the charming , wealthy , discreet giant of wall street at the golf club or the yachting marina .
the very respectability of the clientele helped with further recruitment .
madoff customers were directors of charities and managers of investment funds as well as wealthy business people and pensioners .
they were mainly , in other words , people who should have known better and they fell for one of the oldest illusions in the book : that there is an inside track in the world of investment .
mr madoff fed that illusion , and offered himself as the man who could offer you access to that magic , secret circle .
too respectable the giant bailout of the american financial system earlier this year introduced the concept of the bank that is " too big to fail " , in other words , is of such importance to the world 's financial system that governments decide that propping it up with public money is better than allowing it to suffer the consequences of its own greed or incompetence .
in his own way , mr madoff was something similar - an investment adviser who was too respectable to scrutinise .
as former chairman of the nasdaq stock exchange , mr madoff was a huge figure on wall street - his thoughtful analysis of how modern regulatory systems made cheating virtually impossible has been one of the most-viewed clips on youtube in the last few days .
the regulatory authorities , now that they have finally woken up , are now assessing how much of mr madoff 's clients ' money has actually been lost and how much if any might be recovered .
mr madoff kept his hedge fund business separate from the rest of his firm the particular nature of the alleged fraud means , however , that existing clients seem to have been paid out of money taken from new customers as they joined the scheme .
that probably means that if mr madoff owes you money at the moment , the chances are that you will not be getting it back .
it is not clear how many people working for mr madoff knew what he was really up to with the funds collected from wealthy investors .
it has been widely reported that he operated this side of his business on a separate floor of the manhattan skyscraper where his main company was based and it is even possible that he did not tell anyone else what was really going on until he explained it to his sons last week .
the court proceedings that grow out of all of this are likely to be complex and highly technical , but a friend of mine who works in the banking sector says the best way of understanding mr madoff is to compare him to the kind of racing tipsters who advertise their services in the back of sporting newspapers .
they too offer inside knowledge in return for a fee and should be asked the same question that more people should have asked mr madoff - if this scheme for making money is really so good , why sell it at all ?
why not simply use the technique to make money yourself ?
i asked the regulator if the world would learn a lesson from the madoff case and , depressingly , he was doubtful that it would .
these kind of schemes are only possible in a rising market and the next time the market is rising strongly - as it surely will one day - that old feeling of irrational euphoria will take over .
the reason we are easy to fool in the end is because we are so good at fooling ourselves .

mr madoff recruited several clients at the palm beach country club if something sounds too good to be true , i keep reading , that must be because it is too good to be true .
it is good advice as far as it goes and it raises the question of why so many wealthy , sophisticated savers were apparently conned into believing that mr madoff had come up with an investment strategy that allowed him to pay handsome returns even when the stock market was falling .
i asked a very senior regulator about this , a man who has been involved in formulating public policy for many years , and he said the answer was depressingly simple .
people are prone to believe what they want to believe , he said , and in rising markets a kind of irrational euphoria takes hold in which we are not inclined to ask difficult questions .
human psychology the point about bernie madoff was not so much what he was selling , it was how he sold it .
on offer was a fairly standard hedge fund arrangement in which the madoff firm bought stock in a company and then hedged against the risk by striking contracts to both buy and sell shares in the company at agreed dates in the future .
in the jargon of wall street that is a " collar " .
it is perfectly legal , but it requires endless resources of luck , judgement , money and timing .
what made mr madoff unusual was the manner in which he recruited his investors .
for that he relied on a powerful but elementary piece of human psychology : the more someone tells you that you can not have something , the more you want it .
the reason we are easy to fool in the end is because we are so good at fooling ourselves membership of the madoff fund was very strictly by invitation only - merely being rich was not enough in itself .
clients were recruited through the social networks of which mr madoff and his wife were themselves members - many were jewish new yorkers who spent part of the year in florida .
others came across the charming , wealthy , discreet giant of wall street at the golf club or the yachting marina .
the very respectability of the clientele helped with further recruitment .
madoff customers were directors of charities and managers of investment funds as well as wealthy business people and pensioners .
they were mainly , in other words , people who should have known better and they fell for one of the oldest illusions in the book : that there is an inside track in the world of investment .
mr madoff fed that illusion , and offered himself as the man who could offer you access to that magic , secret circle .
too respectable the giant bailout of the american financial system earlier this year introduced the concept of the bank that is " too big to fail " , in other words , is of such importance to the world 's financial system that governments decide that propping it up with public money is better than allowing it to suffer the consequences of its own greed or incompetence .
in his own way , mr madoff was something similar - an investment adviser who was too respectable to scrutinise .
as former chairman of the nasdaq stock exchange , mr madoff was a huge figure on wall street - his thoughtful analysis of how modern regulatory systems made cheating virtually impossible has been one of the most-viewed clips on youtube in the last few days .
the regulatory authorities , now that they have finally woken up , are now assessing how much of mr madoff 's clients ' money has actually been lost and how much if any might be recovered .
mr madoff kept his hedge fund business separate from the rest of his firm the particular nature of the alleged fraud means , however , that existing clients seem to have been paid out of money taken from new customers as they joined the scheme .
that probably means that if mr madoff owes you money at the moment , the chances are that you will not be getting it back .
it is not clear how many people working for mr madoff knew what he was really up to with the funds collected from wealthy investors .
it has been widely reported that he operated this side of his business on a separate floor of the manhattan skyscraper where his main company was based and it is even possible that he did not tell anyone else what was really going on until he explained it to his sons last week .
the court proceedings that grow out of all of this are likely to be complex and highly technical , but a friend of mine who works in the banking sector says the best way of understanding mr madoff is to compare him to the kind of racing tipsters who advertise their services in the back of sporting newspapers .
they too offer inside knowledge in return for a fee and should be asked the same question that more people should have asked mr madoff - if this scheme for making money is really so good , why sell it at all ?
why not simply use the technique to make money yourself ?
i asked the regulator if the world would learn a lesson from the madoff case and , depressingly , he was doubtful that it would .
these kind of schemes are only possible in a rising market and the next time the market is rising strongly - as it surely will one day - that old feeling of irrational euphoria will take over .
the reason we are easy to fool in the end is because we are so good at fooling ourselves .

the site , near the pacific coastal city of chiclayo , probably dates to the wari culture which ruled the andes of modern peru between the 7th and 12th century .
the once buried city showed evidence of human sacrifice .

compared to children in the 1980s , today 's youngsters are fatter and most of their excess weight gain happens before school age , they will say .
this suggests initiatives to prevent childhood obesity should be started before school , suggest the authors .
the earlybird diabetes study of 233 children from birth to puberty is being published in the journal pediatrics .
one in four children aged four to five in england are overweight , latest figures show .
disease ' of our time ' at birth , the children in the study were of similar weight to babies 25 years ago , but had gained more fat by puberty compared with children of the same age in the 1980s . "
when they reach the age of five the die seems to be cast " professor terry wilkin peninsula medical school the bulk of this excess weight was gained before the children were five .
weight at five years bore little relation to birth weight , but closely predicted weight at nine years old .
before an obese girl reaches school age she will have already gained 90 % of her excess weight , and boys will have gained 70 % of their excess weight .
lead researcher professor terry wilkin , of the peninsula medical school , plymouth , said : " when they reach the age of five the die seems to be cast , at least until the age of puberty .
" what is causing it is very difficult to know . "
he said there must be a factor now that was not there 25 years ago which is making today 's children obese .
and , given the young age , this is likely to be in a child 's home rather than school environment and linked to upbringing rather than schooling .
diet blamed rather than lack of physical exercise , he believes diet could be to blame .
" it is entirely possible that the calorie density of food and portion sizes could be higher . "
" obesity is one of the few medical problems that can be reversed very , very quickly " sir liam donaldson chief medical officer for england he said strategies to prevent childhood obesity and its associated health problems , such as type 2 diabetes , might do better to focus on pre-school children .
professor wilkin said there had been a lot of focus on school meals , pe time , school runs , television viewing and computer games in the development of childhood obesity , but these are all issues for school age children .
but he said the mandatory measurement of the height and weight of all children in england on school entry at the age of four or five could be helpful , not only as a record of national obesity trends , but also as a pointer to future risk for the individual child .
sir liam donaldson , the chief medical officer for england , said it was no exaggeration to describe soaring rates of obesity as an " impending crisis " .
he said : " we need to get in early and build the foundations to healthy living from a very early stage . "
however , he added : " it is never too late .
obesity is one of the few serious medical problems that can be reversed very , very quickly . "
sir liam said eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day was one of the most important elements of a healthy diet .
david haslam , of the national obesity forum , said : " it is never too late or too early to intervene .
the earlier the better in terms of long-term outlook . "
he said early childhood obesity was likely to be down to environment and learned behaviours .

advertisement thomas broomhall , who is eight-years-old , has lost two stone childhood obesity is set before the age of five , ministers will hear from researchers later .
compared to children in the 1980s , today 's youngsters are fatter and most of their excess weight gain happens before school age , they will say .
this suggests initiatives to prevent childhood obesity should be started before school , suggest the authors .
the earlybird diabetes study of 233 children from birth to puberty is being published in the journal pediatrics .
one in four children aged four to five in england are overweight , latest figures show .
disease ' of our time ' at birth , the children in the study were of similar weight to babies 25 years ago , but had gained more fat by puberty compared with children of the same age in the 1980s .
when they reach the age of five the die seems to be cast professor terry wilkin peninsula medical school the bulk of this excess weight was gained before the children were five .
weight at five years bore little relation to birth weight , but closely predicted weight at nine years old .
before an obese girl reaches school age she will have already gained 90 % of her excess weight , and boys will have gained 70 % of their excess weight .
lead researcher professor terry wilkin , of the peninsula medical school , plymouth , said : " when they reach the age of five the die seems to be cast , at least until the age of puberty .
" what is causing it is very difficult to know . "
he said there must be a factor now that was not there 25 years ago which is making today 's children obese .
and , given the young age , this is likely to be in a child 's home rather than school environment and linked to upbringing rather than schooling .

the decision is subject to a final consultation , with the final decision due in february or march .
why are regulators unhappy with baa ?
baa has controlled heathrow , gatwick and stansted airports for more than 40 years and has owned edinburgh and glasgow airports since the early 1970s .
the competition commission is concerned about a lack of competition between airports in the south-east of england and central scotland , and says baa 's common ownership of airports there is largely to blame .
it believes this has contributed to a poor level of service to passengers and airlines as it reduces incentives for improvements .
baa , it says , has been slow to develop new routes at some airports and has been sluggish in its approach to investing in new terminals and pushing for extra runways .
it contrasts this with the performance of other airports , such as manchester and london city , which it says have been more responsive to customers ' needs and have managed to both expand and lower charges .
what are they proposing to do about it ?
regulators believe baa should have to sell two of its three airports in the south-east of england and one of its airports in central scotland .
baa has already ruled out selling heathrow , by far the largest and most profitable airport in its portfolio .
on wednesday , the competition commission said that baa would be forced to sell gatwick and stansted in the southeast and edinburgh in scotland .
" under separate ownership , the airport operators including baa , will have a much greater incentive to be far more responsive to their customers , both airlines and passengers , " the competition commission says .
it also said it would introduce measures to ensure that levels of service at heathrow met the needs of passengers more effectively .
does anyone want to buy these airports ?
the queue to buy these prized assets is likely to be as long .
2007 passenger numbers at baa airports heathrow : 67.8 million gatwick : 35.1 million stansted : 23.7 million edinburgh : 9.0 million glasgow : 8.7 million aberdeen : 3.4 million southampton : 1.9 million source : baa baa told to sell three airports virgin atlantic says it is planning a bid for gatwick airport , in conjunction with other parties .
other companies linked with the airports include german firms fraport and hochtief , australia 's macquarie , and manchester airports group -lrb- mag -rrb- , which already owns manchester and bournemouth airports .
global infrastructure partners , part-owner of london city , is known to want to expand , while ryanair boss michael o 'leary has claimed he would jump at the chance of buying stansted , the airline 's uk base .
gatwick 's attractiveness to potential bidders is slightly reduced by the fact that no new runway can be built there until at least 2019 .
however , the airport is still very lucrative , making a £ 98m profit in the last nine months of 2006 , while a new owner would have the scope to lure some airlines from heathrow .
the value of stansted - which made a £ 42m profit over the same period - is likely to depend on whether planning permission for a second runway there is granted .
nevertheless , experts believe both airports are likely to fetch more than £ 1bn were they to be sold .
what does baa say about all this ?
baa had resisted being forced to sell any of its airports and has disagreed with the commission 's decision on which airports should find new owners .
it says that the commission does not have " compelling evidence " that stansted should be sold , adding that there was " no justification " for specifying which scottish airport should be sold .
" we do not believe that it has set out compelling evidence to support its view that selling stansted as well as gatwick will increase competition and we remain concerned that its proposed remedies may actually delay the introduction of new runway capacity , " baa says .
plus baa 's spanish owner ferrovial has wider issues to consider .
it amassed a huge debt when it bought baa in 2006 - its debt stood at 30bn euros at the end of 2007 - and this has weighed on its share price .
baa recently refinanced its own existing debt obligations , generating £ 3bn to fund immediate investment in its uk airports .
but with an expensive and complex project to rebuild heathrow 's terminal 2 on the horizon , some analysts have suggested it may welcome selling some other airports to help fund future plans .
is this all good news for passengers ?
in theory , a situation in which heathrow , gatwick and stansted compete directly for business and new routes could be good news for passengers .
people may have more options for where they fly from and airlines seeking to trump up business could choose to do so by cutting fares .
some people have little choice in where they travel from while , whatever happens to gatwick , stansted and edinburgh , the bulk of transatlantic and far east flights will still depart from heathrow .
the competition commission says the break-up of baa would be a " first step " in liberalising the market but acknowledges that current problems will not be " solved overnight " .
it can do little about capacity constraints , with many of the uk 's airports already at bursting point .
the amount that airports charge airlines will remain highly regulated , although the competition commission says the civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- should be given enhanced powers to protect consumers and hold airport owners to account .
it also says the government 's aviation expansion policy has partly contributed to market distortions and needs to be reviewed .
some airlines believe changes in the industry should not stop with baa and that individual terminals at big airports should be separately owned .

the decision is subject to a final consultation , with the final decision due in february or march .
why are regulators unhappy with baa ?
baa has controlled heathrow , gatwick and stansted airports for more than 40 years and has owned edinburgh and glasgow airports since the early 1970s .
the competition commission is concerned about a lack of competition between airports in the south-east of england and central scotland , and says baa 's common ownership of airports there is largely to blame .
it believes this has contributed to a poor level of service to passengers and airlines as it reduces incentives for improvements .
baa , it says , has been slow to develop new routes at some airports and has been sluggish in its approach to investing in new terminals and pushing for extra runways .
it contrasts this with the performance of other airports , such as manchester and london city , which it says have been more responsive to customers ' needs and have managed to both expand and lower charges .
what are they proposing to do about it ?
regulators believe baa should have to sell two of its three airports in the south-east of england and one of its airports in central scotland .
baa has already ruled out selling heathrow , by far the largest and most profitable airport in its portfolio .
on wednesday , the competition commission said that baa would be forced to sell gatwick and stansted in the southeast and edinburgh in scotland .
" under separate ownership , the airport operators including baa , will have a much greater incentive to be far more responsive to their customers , both airlines and passengers , " the competition commission says .
it also said it would introduce measures to ensure that levels of service at heathrow met the needs of passengers more effectively .
does anyone want to buy these airports ?
the queue to buy these prized assets is likely to be as long .
2007 passenger numbers at baa airports heathrow : 67.8 million gatwick : 35.1 million stansted : 23.7 million edinburgh : 9.0 million glasgow : 8.7 million aberdeen : 3.4 million southampton : 1.9 million source : baa baa told to sell three airports virgin atlantic says it is planning a bid for gatwick airport , in conjunction with other parties .
other companies linked with the airports include german firms fraport and hochtief , australia 's macquarie , and manchester airports group -lrb- mag -rrb- , which already owns manchester and bournemouth airports .
global infrastructure partners , part-owner of london city , is known to want to expand , while ryanair boss michael o 'leary has claimed he would jump at the chance of buying stansted , the airline 's uk base .
gatwick 's attractiveness to potential bidders is slightly reduced by the fact that no new runway can be built there until at least 2019 .
however , the airport is still very lucrative , making a £ 98m profit in the last nine months of 2006 , while a new owner would have the scope to lure some airlines from heathrow .
the value of stansted - which made a £ 42m profit over the same period - is likely to depend on whether planning permission for a second runway there is granted .
nevertheless , experts believe both airports are likely to fetch more than £ 1bn were they to be sold .
what does baa say about all this ?
baa had resisted being forced to sell any of its airports and has disagreed with the commission 's decision on which airports should find new owners .
it says that the commission does not have " compelling evidence " that stansted should be sold , adding that there was " no justification " for specifying which scottish airport should be sold .
" we do not believe that it has set out compelling evidence to support its view that selling stansted as well as gatwick will increase competition and we remain concerned that its proposed remedies may actually delay the introduction of new runway capacity , " baa says .
regulators can do little about the controversial issue of capacity plus baa 's spanish owner ferrovial has wider issues to consider .
it amassed a huge debt when it bought baa in 2006 - its debt stood at 30bn euros at the end of 2007 - and this has weighed on its share price .
baa recently refinanced its own existing debt obligations , generating £ 3bn to fund immediate investment in its uk airports .
but with an expensive and complex project to rebuild heathrow 's terminal 2 on the horizon , some analysts have suggested it may welcome selling some other airports to help fund future plans .
is this all good news for passengers ?
in theory , a situation in which heathrow , gatwick and stansted compete directly for business and new routes could be good news for passengers .
people may have more options for where they fly from and airlines seeking to trump up business could choose to do so by cutting fares .
some people have little choice in where they travel from while , whatever happens to gatwick , stansted and edinburgh , the bulk of transatlantic and far east flights will still depart from heathrow .
the competition commission says the break-up of baa would be a " first step " in liberalising the market but acknowledges that current problems will not be " solved overnight " .
it can do little about capacity constraints , with many of the uk 's airports already at bursting point .
the amount that airports charge airlines will remain highly regulated , although the competition commission says the civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- should be given enhanced powers to protect consumers and hold airport owners to account .
it also says the government 's aviation expansion policy has partly contributed to market distortions and needs to be reviewed .
some airlines believe changes in the industry should not stop with baa and that individual terminals at big airports should be separately owned .

the decision is subject to a final consultation , with the final decision due in february or march .
why are regulators unhappy with baa ?
baa has controlled heathrow , gatwick and stansted airports for more than 40 years and has owned edinburgh and glasgow airports since the early 1970s .
the competition commission is concerned about a lack of competition between airports in the south-east of england and central scotland , and says baa 's common ownership of airports there is largely to blame .
it believes this has contributed to a poor level of service to passengers and airlines as it reduces incentives for improvements .
baa , it says , has been slow to develop new routes at some airports and has been sluggish in its approach to investing in new terminals and pushing for extra runways .
it contrasts this with the performance of other airports , such as manchester and london city , which it says have been more responsive to customers ' needs and have managed to both expand and lower charges .
what are they proposing to do about it ?
regulators believe baa should have to sell two of its three airports in the south-east of england and one of its airports in central scotland .
baa has already ruled out selling heathrow , by far the largest and most profitable airport in its portfolio .
on wednesday , the competition commission said that baa would be forced to sell gatwick and stansted in the southeast and edinburgh in scotland .
" under separate ownership , the airport operators including baa , will have a much greater incentive to be far more responsive to their customers , both airlines and passengers , " the competition commission says .
it also said it would introduce measures to ensure that levels of service at heathrow met the needs of passengers more effectively .
does anyone want to buy these airports ?
the queue to buy these prized assets is likely to be as long .
2007 passenger numbers at baa airports heathrow : 67.8 million gatwick : 35.1 million stansted : 23.7 million edinburgh : 9.0 million glasgow : 8.7 million aberdeen : 3.4 million southampton : 1.9 million source : baa baa told to sell three airports virgin atlantic says it is planning a bid for gatwick airport , in conjunction with other parties .
other companies linked with the airports include german firms fraport and hochtief , australia 's macquarie , and manchester airports group -lrb- mag -rrb- , which already owns manchester and bournemouth airports .
global infrastructure partners , part-owner of london city , is known to want to expand , while ryanair boss michael o 'leary has claimed he would jump at the chance of buying stansted , the airline 's uk base .
gatwick 's attractiveness to potential bidders is slightly reduced by the fact that no new runway can be built there until at least 2019 .
however , the airport is still very lucrative , making a £ 98m profit in the last nine months of 2006 , while a new owner would have the scope to lure some airlines from heathrow .
the value of stansted - which made a £ 42m profit over the same period - is likely to depend on whether planning permission for a second runway there is granted .
nevertheless , experts believe both airports are likely to fetch more than £ 1bn were they to be sold .
what does baa say about all this ?
baa had resisted being forced to sell any of its airports and has disagreed with the commission 's decision on which airports should find new owners .
it says that the commission does not have " compelling evidence " that stansted should be sold , adding that there was " no justification " for specifying which scottish airport should be sold .
" we do not believe that it has set out compelling evidence to support its view that selling stansted as well as gatwick will increase competition and we remain concerned that its proposed remedies may actually delay the introduction of new runway capacity , " baa says .

the poster for righteous kill was displayed at the station where mr de menezes , 27 , was shot dead after being mistaken for a suicide bomber .
its tagline read : " there 's nothing wrong with a little shooting as long as the right people get shot . "
the advertising standards authority said it breached guidelines on decency .
" we understood the siting of the poster at the station was unintentional , but nevertheless considered that the text had the potential to cause serious offence in that location , " the asa said in its adjudication .
it added that the poster , which also featured stars al pacino and robert de niro , breached rules on social responsibility .
the asa welcomed the decision by film distributor lions gate and advertising company cbs to quickly remove the poster - but it was still on display when members of the inquest jury visited stockwell station in september .
mr de menezes was shot dead on a tube train at stockwell six other complaints against the film 's advertising campaign were dismissed .
five members of the public contacted the asa to say they thought the text on the poster glamorised violence .
a further complainant said the film 's newspaper advertisement was irresponsible at a time of concern about knife and gun crime .
' wryly humorous ' lions gate said there had been " no intention to offend " or " to suggest it was morally acceptable to kill people " .
the asa acknowledged public concerns about crime , but noted that " the poster and press ad did not contain any violence or depiction of guns " .
" we considered that most people were likely to understand that the poster reflected the content of the film and the quote was intended to be wryly humorous , " it added .
the film starred robert de niro -lrb- left -rrb- and al pacino as police detectives two other film campaigns have caused concern for the public over the last couple of months .
advertisements for guy ritchie 's gangster caper rock n rolla prompted two people to complain that gun violence was being glorified .
the asa agreed with film company warner bros that the guns were not a predominant element in its poster campaign .
however , it ruled that an internet advertisement - which showed a character pointing two guns alongside the text " hit me " - condoned violence and was in breach of standards .
a tv advert for nic cage action film bangkok dangerous was also found to be in breach of guidelines because it showed images of violence before the 9pm watershed .
both adverts are not to be shown again in their current form .

the poster for righteous kill was displayed at the station where mr de menezes , 27 , was shot dead after being mistaken for a suicide bomber .
its tagline read : " there 's nothing wrong with a little shooting as long as the right people get shot . "
the advertising standards authority said it breached guidelines on decency .
" we understood the siting of the poster at the station was unintentional , but nevertheless considered that the text had the potential to cause serious offence in that location , " the asa said in its adjudication .
it added that the poster , which also featured stars al pacino and robert de niro , breached rules on social responsibility .
the asa welcomed the decision by film distributor lions gate and advertising company cbs to quickly remove the poster - but it was still on display when members of the inquest jury visited stockwell station in september .
mr de menezes was shot dead on a tube train at stockwell six other complaints against the film 's advertising campaign were dismissed .
five members of the public contacted the asa to say they thought the text on the poster glamorised violence .
a further complainant said the film 's newspaper advertisement was irresponsible at a time of concern about knife and gun crime .
' wryly humorous ' lions gate said there had been " no intention to offend " or " to suggest it was morally acceptable to kill people " .
the asa acknowledged public concerns about crime , but noted that " the poster and press ad did not contain any violence or depiction of guns " .
" we considered that most people were likely to understand that the poster reflected the content of the film and the quote was intended to be wryly humorous , " it added .
the film starred robert de niro -lrb- left -rrb- and al pacino as police detectives two other film campaigns have caused concern for the public over the last couple of months .
advertisements for guy ritchie 's gangster caper rock n rolla prompted two people to complain that gun violence was being glorified .
the asa agreed with film company warner bros that the guns were not a predominant element in its poster campaign .
however , it ruled that an internet advertisement - which showed a character pointing two guns alongside the text " hit me " - condoned violence and was in breach of standards .
a tv advert for nic cage action film bangkok dangerous was also found to be in breach of guidelines because it showed images of violence before the 9pm watershed .
both adverts are not to be shown again in their current form .
