ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .
mps watch from irish pub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland was the only country in the 27-member bloc to hold a referendum a number of officials decided to follow the vote count on a giant screen at kitty o 'shea 's irish pub , a popular hang-out next to the commission 's headquarters . " i am very disappointed , especially when you consider all that the eu has done for ireland , " its publican said . " i think the irish government should have done more to put its message across , " he added . elmar brok and jo leinen , two german members of the european parliament who had taken part in the treaty 's negotiations , were among the first to react to the news . and both of them urged the remaining eight member states to go ahead and ratify the text , in spite of the irish ' no . ' " this would be in the best interest of the member states and the citizens of the eu , " said brok , a conservative . despite the crisis , the treaty should not be shelved , added leinen , a socialist . " eighteen countries , more than two-thirds of all member states , have already ratified the treaty , and the ratification process in the remaining member states should go on without any delay or interruption , " leinen said . eu treaty take two the lisbon treaty is designed to streamline the running of the 27-member bloc . it was agreed after years of intense wrangling and was meant to replace the failed eu constitution that was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . its rejection by ireland was expected to seriously damage the prospects of it coming into force in early 2009 , as planned . member states will have a first opportunity to discuss the results of the referendum during a meeting of foreign ministers scheduled to take place in luxembourg on monday and tuesday . the institutional discussions would likely overshadow planned ministerial talks on other important issues such as the deployment of an eu mission in kosovo , the possible lifting of cuban sanctions and the difficult situation in zimbabwe and myanmar .

" i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .

chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .

we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .

" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "
another cordoba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrians still love to remember cordoba together with her austrian counterpart alfred gusenbauer , german chancellor angela merkel will be attending the germany-austria game at euro 2008 in vienna on monday .
both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .
in addition , it is co-host of the tournament which makes expectations in the country even higher . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

labels on dvds that indicate age-appropriate content need to be large enough so that parents and cashiers at the checkout counters can see at first glance if a game or movie is banned for underage minors and children . the move has been a response to school rampages in emsdetten and erfurt in which the perpetrators of the shooting sprees were apparently influenced by the violent computer game “ counter strike ” .
link between juvenile crime and school failure there is a correlation between juvenile crime and failure at school with the amount of time a youth spends playing violent computer games , according to one german study .
a school psychologist in munich , werner hopf , surveyed 653 schoolboys over two years , the hamburg-based magazine geo wissen reported .
playing such computer games , in which boys pretend to kill and maim others , was the best predictor of which boys would get into trouble with police , although other factors included poverty , poor relationships with parents or growing up in a criminal environment .
boys playing violent games were far more likely to be charged with assault , vandalism , bullying and theft from vending machines and also more likely to perform poorly in school .
the school massacres have prompted an intense public debate about banning " first-person shooter " games , but civil-liberties groups and the game industry advocates have denied any significant links between viewing violent movies and juvenile delinquency . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "

they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .

" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .

ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .

" i am very disappointed , especially when you consider all that the eu has done for ireland , " its publican said . " i think the irish government should have done more to put its message across , " he added . elmar brok and jo leinen , two german members of the european parliament who had taken part in the treaty 's negotiations , were among the first to react to the news . and both of them urged the remaining eight member states to go ahead and ratify the text , in spite of the irish ' no . ' " this would be in the best interest of the member states and the citizens of the eu , " said brok , a conservative . despite the crisis , the treaty should not be shelved , added leinen , a socialist . " eighteen countries , more than two-thirds of all member states , have already ratified the treaty , and the ratification process in the remaining member states should go on without any delay or interruption , " leinen said . eu treaty take two the lisbon treaty is designed to streamline the running of the 27-member bloc . it was agreed after years of intense wrangling and was meant to replace the failed eu constitution that was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . its rejection by ireland was expected to seriously damage the prospects of it coming into force in early 2009 , as planned . member states will have a first opportunity to discuss the results of the referendum during a meeting of foreign ministers scheduled to take place in luxembourg on monday and tuesday . the institutional discussions would likely overshadow planned ministerial talks on other important issues such as the deployment of an eu mission in kosovo , the possible lifting of cuban sanctions and the difficult situation in zimbabwe and myanmar .

" when the time comes to welcome a new american president next january , i will be pleased to report to him that the relationship between the united states and europe is the broadest and most vibrant it has ever been , " bush said . on saturday , bush delivers the keynote address of his tour at the paris headquarters of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , emphasizing the need for us-european unity rather than a focus on disputes over climate change , afghanistan and ways to address terrorism . bush hails a " new era " the us leader said he had seen the shape of a " new era " of " a revitalized relationship between europe and america " in leaders like german chancellor angela merkel , french president nicolas sarkozy and prime ministers gordon brown of britain and silvio berlusconi of italy . " i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .
" we must go forward with unity .
dividing democracies is one of our enemies ' goals and they must not be allowed to succeed , " the said .
sarkozy seen as an ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and sarkozy enjoy a friendly relationship while sarkozy is a critic of many aspects of us foreign policy , the relationship between the two men is much friendlier than that of bush and sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac .
chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .
stealing bush 's thunder while bush spent thursday in rome with conservative ally berlusconi , his wife laura was in paris making a $ 10.2 billion us government commitment to help with reconstruction in afghanistan .
the donation still needs congressional approval .
the us help was announced at an international conference in the french capital which was being held to drum up support for vital improvements to the country .
" afghanistan has reached a decisive moment for its future .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "

austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

germany , which likes to tout itself as the land of poets and thinkers , must once again " become the republic of education , " merkel said in a speech .
" prosperity for all means education for all . "
in no other country in the world in the western world does a child 's socio-economic background make such a difference in educational achievement , according to educational experts at oecd . in germany , the “ hauptschule ” , which is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system which tracks pupils according to academic ability at the age of ten , has come under harsh attack .
a disproportionate number of children from poor or migrant families attend the german hauptschule .
migrants and the poor are not more stupid “ back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , ” andreas schleicher , coordinator of the pisa studies for oecd said in a dw-world.de interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many top strikers on the german national soccer team are immigrants who made it “ migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? ” added schleicher .
merkel said a national education summit will take place in dresden on october 22 with representatives from all of germany 's 16 federal states . in germany , it is the states that are responsible for running the country 's school system .
soccer provides the possibility for all to advance with the european championships now in full swing , merkel also singled out one field where talent and merit allows any individual to advance - soccer . “ mario gomez , kevin kuranyi , lukas podolski are only three of many talented strikers on our national team , ” she said , hinting that the success of three foreign-born german citizens who made it , should be a model for the rest of the nation .
the chancellor , who sees a good education as the key for integration of migrants in german society , is making educational policy the cornerstone of domestic policy “ being a teacher is one of the most important professions in our society , ” she added . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when the time comes to welcome a new american president next january , i will be pleased to report to him that the relationship between the united states and europe is the broadest and most vibrant it has ever been , " bush said . on saturday , bush delivers the keynote address of his tour at the paris headquarters of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , emphasizing the need for us-european unity rather than a focus on disputes over climate change , afghanistan and ways to address terrorism . bush hails a " new era " the us leader said he had seen the shape of a " new era " of " a revitalized relationship between europe and america " in leaders like german chancellor angela merkel , french president nicolas sarkozy and prime ministers gordon brown of britain and silvio berlusconi of italy . " i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .
" we must go forward with unity .
dividing democracies is one of our enemies ' goals and they must not be allowed to succeed , " the said .
sarkozy seen as an ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and sarkozy enjoy a friendly relationship while sarkozy is a critic of many aspects of us foreign policy , the relationship between the two men is much friendlier than that of bush and sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac .
chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .
stealing bush 's thunder while bush spent thursday in rome with conservative ally berlusconi , his wife laura was in paris making a $ 10.2 billion us government commitment to help with reconstruction in afghanistan .
the donation still needs congressional approval .
the us help was announced at an international conference in the french capital which was being held to drum up support for vital improvements to the country .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "
other matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia was jubilant croatia defeated germany 2-1 earlier in the evening and now ca n't be caught at the head of the group .
they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .
" that is not an issue at all .
we just want to play well and will not be thinking about what happened 30 years ago , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "

they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .
at volkswagen , several former top managers of europe 's biggest carmaker have also been prosecuted after revelations in 2005 that they used a slush fund to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
earlier this year , klaus zumwinkel resigned as ceo of deutsche post ag after being charged with tax evasion in an wide-reaching investigation of offshore bank accounts that involves hundreds of germans .
last month , german prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations that deutsche telekom ag monitored telephone records to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws .
the german food discounter lidl was also charged for violating privacy laws by spying on its employees with video surveillance .
merkel warns of blanket condemnation however in an interview with the financial times earlier , merkel had also stressed the financial benefits that such firms bring to the country and warned against a blanket condemnation of all german businesses across the board .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .

after taking a big financial hit from the credit crisis , new york-based citigroup is considering spinning off its german banking unit . possible three-way merger with a large part of germany 's banking market in the hands of state banks that turn in a low return on equity , the country 's banks have been battling for years with low profitability . the moves by dresdner and commerzbank to forge a tie-up could be part of a prelude to the two frankfurt cross-town rivals launching what would be a three-way merger with postbank to form a new banking powerhouse in europe 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank brings 14 million private customers this would also represent a challenge to germany 's state-owned and cooperative banks which have a strangle hold on the nation 's retail banking business , controlling about two thirds of the market , and which have been a major stumbling bloc to any major industry restructuring . however , the fallout from the credit crisis has also helped to increase the pressure on germany 's state-owned banks to consider mergers , which could help to pave the way for freeing up the banking system for restructuring . postbank brings coveted customer base the postal and logistics group deutsche post , postbank 's parent , has indicated that it will make a final decision about selling off a big stake in its banking arm early in the second half of the year . with a customer base in germany of more than 14 million and a branch network of over 800 , postbank is considered a major prize in any battle over the future of the nation 's banking sector . allianz , dresdner and commerzbank declined to comment on thursday 's media report that they have launched moves towards forming a new banking group . but there are several possible new banking combinations that could emerge in the run-up to the end of the year with deutsche bank having also said it might to try to pick up postbank . learning from past banking flops however , despite the pressures for a restructuring of the german bank industry , the last major shakeout in the nation 's financial sector was in 2005 when italy 's biggest bank unicredit spa purchased munich-based hvb in what was europe 's biggest-ever cross-border banking deal . after the embarrassing and dramatic collapse eight years ago of deutsche bank 's ambitious 30-billion-dollars merger bid for dresdner , allianz stepped in about 12 months later to pick up dresdner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unicredit-hvb merger in 2005 was europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal this was part of an equally ambitious plan drawn up by allianz to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's network of more than 800 branches . now , with dresdner 's earnings feeling the pinch as a result of the global credit squeeze , allianz appears keen again to play a key role in helping to orchestrate a new wave of bank consolidation in germany - this time by offloading dresdner . " we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said allianz group financial officer helmut perlet after dresdner unveiled a first-quarter loss and allianz said it planned to break up its banking offshoot later this year . obstacles lie ahead for bank consolidators analysts see allianz as possibly spinning off dresdner to commerzbank with the new financial house then moving in to buy a controlling stake in postbank . the three-way merger would mean an expanded distribution network for allianz to sell its insurance and pension products . but as was the case in the past , those driving bank consolidation in germany face an uphill battle to bring about any far-reaching change in the nation 's finance sector . for one , even if dresdner and commerzbank did try to mount a merger with postbank they could face stiff competition from several foreign-owned heavyweights , including spain 's banco santander sa and the netherlands ' ing , which has already been seeking to make inroads into germany . moreover , the synergies and cost savings that executives would want to secure from a link up between postbank , dresdner and commerzbank could also mean them finding themselves facing tough union action to head off any cuts in the banks ' labor force . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .

ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .
mps watch from irish pub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland was the only country in the 27-member bloc to hold a referendum a number of officials decided to follow the vote count on a giant screen at kitty o 'shea 's irish pub , a popular hang-out next to the commission 's headquarters . " i am very disappointed , especially when you consider all that the eu has done for ireland , " its publican said .

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 13.06.2008 france must conquer dutch man-mountain in bid for qualification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a big man to boss the italian midfield but dutch star engelaar managed it it was in the 51st minute of the netherlands-italy game that gennaro gattuso probably realized he had bitten off more than he could chew .
here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .

" when the time comes to welcome a new american president next january , i will be pleased to report to him that the relationship between the united states and europe is the broadest and most vibrant it has ever been , " bush said . on saturday , bush delivers the keynote address of his tour at the paris headquarters of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , emphasizing the need for us-european unity rather than a focus on disputes over climate change , afghanistan and ways to address terrorism . bush hails a " new era " the us leader said he had seen the shape of a " new era " of " a revitalized relationship between europe and america " in leaders like german chancellor angela merkel , french president nicolas sarkozy and prime ministers gordon brown of britain and silvio berlusconi of italy . " i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .
" we must go forward with unity .
dividing democracies is one of our enemies ' goals and they must not be allowed to succeed , " the said .
sarkozy seen as an ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and sarkozy enjoy a friendly relationship while sarkozy is a critic of many aspects of us foreign policy , the relationship between the two men is much friendlier than that of bush and sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac .
chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .
stealing bush 's thunder while bush spent thursday in rome with conservative ally berlusconi , his wife laura was in paris making a $ 10.2 billion us government commitment to help with reconstruction in afghanistan .
the donation still needs congressional approval .
the us help was announced at an international conference in the french capital which was being held to drum up support for vital improvements to the country .
" afghanistan has reached a decisive moment for its future .

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .

" i am very disappointed , especially when you consider all that the eu has done for ireland , " its publican said . " i think the irish government should have done more to put its message across , " he added . elmar brok and jo leinen , two german members of the european parliament who had taken part in the treaty 's negotiations , were among the first to react to the news . and both of them urged the remaining eight member states to go ahead and ratify the text , in spite of the irish ' no . ' " this would be in the best interest of the member states and the citizens of the eu , " said brok , a conservative . despite the crisis , the treaty should not be shelved , added leinen , a socialist . " eighteen countries , more than two-thirds of all member states , have already ratified the treaty , and the ratification process in the remaining member states should go on without any delay or interruption , " leinen said . eu treaty take two the lisbon treaty is designed to streamline the running of the 27-member bloc . it was agreed after years of intense wrangling and was meant to replace the failed eu constitution that was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . its rejection by ireland was expected to seriously damage the prospects of it coming into force in early 2009 , as planned . member states will have a first opportunity to discuss the results of the referendum during a meeting of foreign ministers scheduled to take place in luxembourg on monday and tuesday . the institutional discussions would likely overshadow planned ministerial talks on other important issues such as the deployment of an eu mission in kosovo , the possible lifting of cuban sanctions and the difficult situation in zimbabwe and myanmar .

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .
at volkswagen , several former top managers of europe 's biggest carmaker have also been prosecuted after revelations in 2005 that they used a slush fund to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
earlier this year , klaus zumwinkel resigned as ceo of deutsche post ag after being charged with tax evasion in an wide-reaching investigation of offshore bank accounts that involves hundreds of germans .
last month , german prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations that deutsche telekom ag monitored telephone records to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws .
the german food discounter lidl was also charged for violating privacy laws by spying on its employees with video surveillance .
merkel warns of blanket condemnation however in an interview with the financial times earlier , merkel had also stressed the financial benefits that such firms bring to the country and warned against a blanket condemnation of all german businesses across the board .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .

austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "
another cordoba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrians still love to remember cordoba together with her austrian counterpart alfred gusenbauer , german chancellor angela merkel will be attending the germany-austria game at euro 2008 in vienna on monday .
both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .
the large majority of biodiesel imports to europe comes from the united states .
the amount has risen from 7,000 tonnes in 2005 to around a million tonnes last year . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "
another cordoba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrians still love to remember cordoba together with her austrian counterpart alfred gusenbauer , german chancellor angela merkel will be attending the germany-austria game at euro 2008 in vienna on monday .
both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .
in addition , it is co-host of the tournament which makes expectations in the country even higher . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "
another cordoba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrians still love to remember cordoba together with her austrian counterpart alfred gusenbauer , german chancellor angela merkel will be attending the germany-austria game at euro 2008 in vienna on monday .
both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .
in addition , it is co-host of the tournament which makes expectations in the country even higher . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after taking a big financial hit from the credit crisis , new york-based citigroup is considering spinning off its german banking unit . possible three-way merger with a large part of germany 's banking market in the hands of state banks that turn in a low return on equity , the country 's banks have been battling for years with low profitability . the moves by dresdner and commerzbank to forge a tie-up could be part of a prelude to the two frankfurt cross-town rivals launching what would be a three-way merger with postbank to form a new banking powerhouse in europe 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank brings 14 million private customers this would also represent a challenge to germany 's state-owned and cooperative banks which have a strangle hold on the nation 's retail banking business , controlling about two thirds of the market , and which have been a major stumbling bloc to any major industry restructuring . however , the fallout from the credit crisis has also helped to increase the pressure on germany 's state-owned banks to consider mergers , which could help to pave the way for freeing up the banking system for restructuring . postbank brings coveted customer base the postal and logistics group deutsche post , postbank 's parent , has indicated that it will make a final decision about selling off a big stake in its banking arm early in the second half of the year . with a customer base in germany of more than 14 million and a branch network of over 800 , postbank is considered a major prize in any battle over the future of the nation 's banking sector . allianz , dresdner and commerzbank declined to comment on thursday 's media report that they have launched moves towards forming a new banking group . but there are several possible new banking combinations that could emerge in the run-up to the end of the year with deutsche bank having also said it might to try to pick up postbank . learning from past banking flops however , despite the pressures for a restructuring of the german bank industry , the last major shakeout in the nation 's financial sector was in 2005 when italy 's biggest bank unicredit spa purchased munich-based hvb in what was europe 's biggest-ever cross-border banking deal . after the embarrassing and dramatic collapse eight years ago of deutsche bank 's ambitious 30-billion-dollars merger bid for dresdner , allianz stepped in about 12 months later to pick up dresdner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unicredit-hvb merger in 2005 was europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal this was part of an equally ambitious plan drawn up by allianz to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's network of more than 800 branches . now , with dresdner 's earnings feeling the pinch as a result of the global credit squeeze , allianz appears keen again to play a key role in helping to orchestrate a new wave of bank consolidation in germany - this time by offloading dresdner . " we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said allianz group financial officer helmut perlet after dresdner unveiled a first-quarter loss and allianz said it planned to break up its banking offshoot later this year . obstacles lie ahead for bank consolidators analysts see allianz as possibly spinning off dresdner to commerzbank with the new financial house then moving in to buy a controlling stake in postbank . the three-way merger would mean an expanded distribution network for allianz to sell its insurance and pension products . but as was the case in the past , those driving bank consolidation in germany face an uphill battle to bring about any far-reaching change in the nation 's finance sector . for one , even if dresdner and commerzbank did try to mount a merger with postbank they could face stiff competition from several foreign-owned heavyweights , including spain 's banco santander sa and the netherlands ' ing , which has already been seeking to make inroads into germany . moreover , the synergies and cost savings that executives would want to secure from a link up between postbank , dresdner and commerzbank could also mean them finding themselves facing tough union action to head off any cuts in the banks ' labor force . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .

ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .
mps watch from irish pub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland was the only country in the 27-member bloc to hold a referendum a number of officials decided to follow the vote count on a giant screen at kitty o 'shea 's irish pub , a popular hang-out next to the commission 's headquarters . " i am very disappointed , especially when you consider all that the eu has done for ireland , " its publican said . " i think the irish government should have done more to put its message across , " he added . elmar brok and jo leinen , two german members of the european parliament who had taken part in the treaty 's negotiations , were among the first to react to the news . and both of them urged the remaining eight member states to go ahead and ratify the text , in spite of the irish ' no . ' " this would be in the best interest of the member states and the citizens of the eu , " said brok , a conservative . despite the crisis , the treaty should not be shelved , added leinen , a socialist . " eighteen countries , more than two-thirds of all member states , have already ratified the treaty , and the ratification process in the remaining member states should go on without any delay or interruption , " leinen said . eu treaty take two the lisbon treaty is designed to streamline the running of the 27-member bloc . it was agreed after years of intense wrangling and was meant to replace the failed eu constitution that was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . its rejection by ireland was expected to seriously damage the prospects of it coming into force in early 2009 , as planned . member states will have a first opportunity to discuss the results of the referendum during a meeting of foreign ministers scheduled to take place in luxembourg on monday and tuesday . the institutional discussions would likely overshadow planned ministerial talks on other important issues such as the deployment of an eu mission in kosovo , the possible lifting of cuban sanctions and the difficult situation in zimbabwe and myanmar .

" when the time comes to welcome a new american president next january , i will be pleased to report to him that the relationship between the united states and europe is the broadest and most vibrant it has ever been , " bush said . on saturday , bush delivers the keynote address of his tour at the paris headquarters of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , emphasizing the need for us-european unity rather than a focus on disputes over climate change , afghanistan and ways to address terrorism . bush hails a " new era " the us leader said he had seen the shape of a " new era " of " a revitalized relationship between europe and america " in leaders like german chancellor angela merkel , french president nicolas sarkozy and prime ministers gordon brown of britain and silvio berlusconi of italy . " i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .
" we must go forward with unity .
dividing democracies is one of our enemies ' goals and they must not be allowed to succeed , " the said .
sarkozy seen as an ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and sarkozy enjoy a friendly relationship while sarkozy is a critic of many aspects of us foreign policy , the relationship between the two men is much friendlier than that of bush and sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac .
chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .
stealing bush 's thunder while bush spent thursday in rome with conservative ally berlusconi , his wife laura was in paris making a $ 10.2 billion us government commitment to help with reconstruction in afghanistan .
the donation still needs congressional approval .
the us help was announced at an international conference in the french capital which was being held to drum up support for vital improvements to the country .

ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .

" i am very disappointed , especially when you consider all that the eu has done for ireland , " its publican said . " i think the irish government should have done more to put its message across , " he added . elmar brok and jo leinen , two german members of the european parliament who had taken part in the treaty 's negotiations , were among the first to react to the news . and both of them urged the remaining eight member states to go ahead and ratify the text , in spite of the irish ' no . ' " this would be in the best interest of the member states and the citizens of the eu , " said brok , a conservative . despite the crisis , the treaty should not be shelved , added leinen , a socialist . " eighteen countries , more than two-thirds of all member states , have already ratified the treaty , and the ratification process in the remaining member states should go on without any delay or interruption , " leinen said . eu treaty take two the lisbon treaty is designed to streamline the running of the 27-member bloc . it was agreed after years of intense wrangling and was meant to replace the failed eu constitution that was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . its rejection by ireland was expected to seriously damage the prospects of it coming into force in early 2009 , as planned . member states will have a first opportunity to discuss the results of the referendum during a meeting of foreign ministers scheduled to take place in luxembourg on monday and tuesday . the institutional discussions would likely overshadow planned ministerial talks on other important issues such as the deployment of an eu mission in kosovo , the possible lifting of cuban sanctions and the difficult situation in zimbabwe and myanmar .

but now , with the german foreign minister in beijing , things seemed to have improved . relations between china and germany have normalized , china 's foreign minister yang jiechi told reporters on friday , june 13 , in beijing . " recently china-germany relations have already moved onto a track of normal development , " he said , calling german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's visit a " major event in china-germany relations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministers are all smiles steinmeier said that china and germany would restart discussions on key global issues , such as conflict prevention in africa and climate change , which had been suspended as a result of the dalai lama 's visit to germany .
china has been criticized in the west for not taking advantage of its influence in sudan to press for an end to violence in darfur . " we will resume the interrupted strategic dialogue in the second half of the year , " said steinmeier , who is seen as a potential future candidate for chancellor . during a meeting with steinmeier , china 's premier wen jiabao said the perception of china in germany had recently improved and gave assurances that the political situation in his country was stable . germany promises 8 schools for quake-hit region the foreign minister pledged reconstruction aid to the earthquake-hit region of sichuan in south-western china and said that germany would help build eight schools in the area . in thanking steinmeier , premier wen said the contributions were a sign of a deep friendship between the countries . steinmeier is scheduled to visit the sichuan province on the weekend .
there he will meet with german aid workers who are helping the survivors of the quake , which left more than 86,000 people dead or missing . dalai lama visit forgiven and forgotten the foreign minister has distanced himself from german chancellor angela merkel 's decision to meet with the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , in berlin last september .
he has since been at the forefront of efforts to repair strained relations with china and refused to meet with the dalai lama when he returned to germany last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama had political consequences however , on friday steinmeier said he hoped the dialogue between china and representatives of the dalai lama would continue .
he added that it was important to germany that progress is made in preserving tibetan culture and religion . steinmeier has also been less vocal about china 's human rights record than the chancellor and has typically favored quiet diplomacy in china 's conflict with tibet . although the dalai lama has repeatedly said he does not advocate self-rule for tibet , an autonomous chinese province , china believes that he is trying to achieve independence and condemns on political grounds all foreign politicians who meet with him .
anger over merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama drove a wedge between the countries , which have established growing trade ties in recent years as the world 's top two exporters of goods . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .
the large majority of biodiesel imports to europe comes from the united states .
the amount has risen from 7,000 tonnes in 2005 to around a million tonnes last year . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .
the large majority of biodiesel imports to europe comes from the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 13.06.2008 merkel announces major education offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germany must once again become the " republic of education " german chancellor angela merkel is putting the nation 's educational system on her list of domestic priorities in the run-up to a major nationwide education summit in fall . on thursday chancellor angela merkel announced a major offensive to tackle germany 's educational system from the kindergarden level to technical schools and night schools for senior citizens .
germany , which likes to tout itself as the land of poets and thinkers , must once again " become the republic of education , " merkel said in a speech .
" prosperity for all means education for all . "
in no other country in the world in the western world does a child 's socio-economic background make such a difference in educational achievement , according to educational experts at oecd . in germany , the “ hauptschule ” , which is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system which tracks pupils according to academic ability at the age of ten , has come under harsh attack .
a disproportionate number of children from poor or migrant families attend the german hauptschule .
migrants and the poor are not more stupid “ back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , ” andreas schleicher , coordinator of the pisa studies for oecd said in a dw-world.de interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many top strikers on the german national soccer team are immigrants who made it “ migrants are not more stupid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 13.06.2008 france must conquer dutch man-mountain in bid for qualification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a big man to boss the italian midfield but dutch star engelaar managed it it was in the 51st minute of the netherlands-italy game that gennaro gattuso probably realized he had bitten off more than he could chew .
here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , with the german foreign minister in beijing , things seemed to have improved . relations between china and germany have normalized , china 's foreign minister yang jiechi told reporters on friday , june 13 , in beijing . " recently china-germany relations have already moved onto a track of normal development , " he said , calling german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's visit a " major event in china-germany relations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministers are all smiles steinmeier said that china and germany would restart discussions on key global issues , such as conflict prevention in africa and climate change , which had been suspended as a result of the dalai lama 's visit to germany .
china has been criticized in the west for not taking advantage of its influence in sudan to press for an end to violence in darfur . " we will resume the interrupted strategic dialogue in the second half of the year , " said steinmeier , who is seen as a potential future candidate for chancellor . during a meeting with steinmeier , china 's premier wen jiabao said the perception of china in germany had recently improved and gave assurances that the political situation in his country was stable . germany promises 8 schools for quake-hit region the foreign minister pledged reconstruction aid to the earthquake-hit region of sichuan in south-western china and said that germany would help build eight schools in the area . in thanking steinmeier , premier wen said the contributions were a sign of a deep friendship between the countries . steinmeier is scheduled to visit the sichuan province on the weekend .
there he will meet with german aid workers who are helping the survivors of the quake , which left more than 86,000 people dead or missing . dalai lama visit forgiven and forgotten the foreign minister has distanced himself from german chancellor angela merkel 's decision to meet with the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , in berlin last september .
he has since been at the forefront of efforts to repair strained relations with china and refused to meet with the dalai lama when he returned to germany last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama had political consequences however , on friday steinmeier said he hoped the dialogue between china and representatives of the dalai lama would continue .
he added that it was important to germany that progress is made in preserving tibetan culture and religion . steinmeier has also been less vocal about china 's human rights record than the chancellor and has typically favored quiet diplomacy in china 's conflict with tibet . although the dalai lama has repeatedly said he does not advocate self-rule for tibet , an autonomous chinese province , china believes that he is trying to achieve independence and condemns on political grounds all foreign politicians who meet with him .
anger over merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama drove a wedge between the countries , which have established growing trade ties in recent years as the world 's top two exporters of goods . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when the time comes to welcome a new american president next january , i will be pleased to report to him that the relationship between the united states and europe is the broadest and most vibrant it has ever been , " bush said . on saturday , bush delivers the keynote address of his tour at the paris headquarters of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , emphasizing the need for us-european unity rather than a focus on disputes over climate change , afghanistan and ways to address terrorism . bush hails a " new era " the us leader said he had seen the shape of a " new era " of " a revitalized relationship between europe and america " in leaders like german chancellor angela merkel , french president nicolas sarkozy and prime ministers gordon brown of britain and silvio berlusconi of italy . " i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .
" we must go forward with unity .

chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .
stealing bush 's thunder while bush spent thursday in rome with conservative ally berlusconi , his wife laura was in paris making a $ 10.2 billion us government commitment to help with reconstruction in afghanistan .
the donation still needs congressional approval .
the us help was announced at an international conference in the french capital which was being held to drum up support for vital improvements to the country .

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .

kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "

both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .

" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .

austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .

he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "

they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .
at volkswagen , several former top managers of europe 's biggest carmaker have also been prosecuted after revelations in 2005 that they used a slush fund to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
earlier this year , klaus zumwinkel resigned as ceo of deutsche post ag after being charged with tax evasion in an wide-reaching investigation of offshore bank accounts that involves hundreds of germans .
last month , german prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations that deutsche telekom ag monitored telephone records to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws .
the german food discounter lidl was also charged for violating privacy laws by spying on its employees with video surveillance .
merkel warns of blanket condemnation however in an interview with the financial times earlier , merkel had also stressed the financial benefits that such firms bring to the country and warned against a blanket condemnation of all german businesses across the board .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , which likes to tout itself as the land of poets and thinkers , must once again " become the republic of education , " merkel said in a speech .
" prosperity for all means education for all . "
in no other country in the world in the western world does a child 's socio-economic background make such a difference in educational achievement , according to educational experts at oecd . in germany , the “ hauptschule ” , which is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system which tracks pupils according to academic ability at the age of ten , has come under harsh attack .
a disproportionate number of children from poor or migrant families attend the german hauptschule .
migrants and the poor are not more stupid “ back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , ” andreas schleicher , coordinator of the pisa studies for oecd said in a dw-world.de interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many top strikers on the german national soccer team are immigrants who made it “ migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? ” added schleicher .
merkel said a national education summit will take place in dresden on october 22 with representatives from all of germany 's 16 federal states . in germany , it is the states that are responsible for running the country 's school system .
soccer provides the possibility for all to advance with the european championships now in full swing , merkel also singled out one field where talent and merit allows any individual to advance - soccer . “ mario gomez , kevin kuranyi , lukas podolski are only three of many talented strikers on our national team , ” she said , hinting that the success of three foreign-born german citizens who made it , should be a model for the rest of the nation .
the chancellor , who sees a good education as the key for integration of migrants in german society , is making educational policy the cornerstone of domestic policy “ being a teacher is one of the most important professions in our society , ” she added . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 13.06.2008 france must conquer dutch man-mountain in bid for qualification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a big man to boss the italian midfield but dutch star engelaar managed it it was in the 51st minute of the netherlands-italy game that gennaro gattuso probably realized he had bitten off more than he could chew .
here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .

after taking a big financial hit from the credit crisis , new york-based citigroup is considering spinning off its german banking unit . possible three-way merger with a large part of germany 's banking market in the hands of state banks that turn in a low return on equity , the country 's banks have been battling for years with low profitability . the moves by dresdner and commerzbank to forge a tie-up could be part of a prelude to the two frankfurt cross-town rivals launching what would be a three-way merger with postbank to form a new banking powerhouse in europe 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank brings 14 million private customers this would also represent a challenge to germany 's state-owned and cooperative banks which have a strangle hold on the nation 's retail banking business , controlling about two thirds of the market , and which have been a major stumbling bloc to any major industry restructuring . however , the fallout from the credit crisis has also helped to increase the pressure on germany 's state-owned banks to consider mergers , which could help to pave the way for freeing up the banking system for restructuring . postbank brings coveted customer base the postal and logistics group deutsche post , postbank 's parent , has indicated that it will make a final decision about selling off a big stake in its banking arm early in the second half of the year . with a customer base in germany of more than 14 million and a branch network of over 800 , postbank is considered a major prize in any battle over the future of the nation 's banking sector . allianz , dresdner and commerzbank declined to comment on thursday 's media report that they have launched moves towards forming a new banking group . but there are several possible new banking combinations that could emerge in the run-up to the end of the year with deutsche bank having also said it might to try to pick up postbank . learning from past banking flops however , despite the pressures for a restructuring of the german bank industry , the last major shakeout in the nation 's financial sector was in 2005 when italy 's biggest bank unicredit spa purchased munich-based hvb in what was europe 's biggest-ever cross-border banking deal . after the embarrassing and dramatic collapse eight years ago of deutsche bank 's ambitious 30-billion-dollars merger bid for dresdner , allianz stepped in about 12 months later to pick up dresdner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unicredit-hvb merger in 2005 was europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal this was part of an equally ambitious plan drawn up by allianz to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's network of more than 800 branches . now , with dresdner 's earnings feeling the pinch as a result of the global credit squeeze , allianz appears keen again to play a key role in helping to orchestrate a new wave of bank consolidation in germany - this time by offloading dresdner . " we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said allianz group financial officer helmut perlet after dresdner unveiled a first-quarter loss and allianz said it planned to break up its banking offshoot later this year . obstacles lie ahead for bank consolidators analysts see allianz as possibly spinning off dresdner to commerzbank with the new financial house then moving in to buy a controlling stake in postbank . the three-way merger would mean an expanded distribution network for allianz to sell its insurance and pension products . but as was the case in the past , those driving bank consolidation in germany face an uphill battle to bring about any far-reaching change in the nation 's finance sector . for one , even if dresdner and commerzbank did try to mount a merger with postbank they could face stiff competition from several foreign-owned heavyweights , including spain 's banco santander sa and the netherlands ' ing , which has already been seeking to make inroads into germany . moreover , the synergies and cost savings that executives would want to secure from a link up between postbank , dresdner and commerzbank could also mean them finding themselves facing tough union action to head off any cuts in the banks ' labor force . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "

they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

labels on dvds that indicate age-appropriate content need to be large enough so that parents and cashiers at the checkout counters can see at first glance if a game or movie is banned for underage minors and children . the move has been a response to school rampages in emsdetten and erfurt in which the perpetrators of the shooting sprees were apparently influenced by the violent computer game “ counter strike ” .
link between juvenile crime and school failure there is a correlation between juvenile crime and failure at school with the amount of time a youth spends playing violent computer games , according to one german study .
a school psychologist in munich , werner hopf , surveyed 653 schoolboys over two years , the hamburg-based magazine geo wissen reported .
playing such computer games , in which boys pretend to kill and maim others , was the best predictor of which boys would get into trouble with police , although other factors included poverty , poor relationships with parents or growing up in a criminal environment .
boys playing violent games were far more likely to be charged with assault , vandalism , bullying and theft from vending machines and also more likely to perform poorly in school .
the school massacres have prompted an intense public debate about banning " first-person shooter " games , but civil-liberties groups and the game industry advocates have denied any significant links between viewing violent movies and juvenile delinquency . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "
another cordoba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrians still love to remember cordoba together with her austrian counterpart alfred gusenbauer , german chancellor angela merkel will be attending the germany-austria game at euro 2008 in vienna on monday .
both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .
in addition , it is co-host of the tournament which makes expectations in the country even higher . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .

germany , which likes to tout itself as the land of poets and thinkers , must once again " become the republic of education , " merkel said in a speech .
" prosperity for all means education for all . "
in no other country in the world in the western world does a child 's socio-economic background make such a difference in educational achievement , according to educational experts at oecd . in germany , the “ hauptschule ” , which is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system which tracks pupils according to academic ability at the age of ten , has come under harsh attack .
a disproportionate number of children from poor or migrant families attend the german hauptschule .
migrants and the poor are not more stupid “ back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , ” andreas schleicher , coordinator of the pisa studies for oecd said in a dw-world.de interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many top strikers on the german national soccer team are immigrants who made it “ migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? ” added schleicher .
merkel said a national education summit will take place in dresden on october 22 with representatives from all of germany 's 16 federal states . in germany , it is the states that are responsible for running the country 's school system .
soccer provides the possibility for all to advance with the european championships now in full swing , merkel also singled out one field where talent and merit allows any individual to advance - soccer . “ mario gomez , kevin kuranyi , lukas podolski are only three of many talented strikers on our national team , ” she said , hinting that the success of three foreign-born german citizens who made it , should be a model for the rest of the nation .
the chancellor , who sees a good education as the key for integration of migrants in german society , is making educational policy the cornerstone of domestic policy “ being a teacher is one of the most important professions in our society , ” she added . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , with the german foreign minister in beijing , things seemed to have improved . relations between china and germany have normalized , china 's foreign minister yang jiechi told reporters on friday , june 13 , in beijing . " recently china-germany relations have already moved onto a track of normal development , " he said , calling german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's visit a " major event in china-germany relations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministers are all smiles steinmeier said that china and germany would restart discussions on key global issues , such as conflict prevention in africa and climate change , which had been suspended as a result of the dalai lama 's visit to germany .
china has been criticized in the west for not taking advantage of its influence in sudan to press for an end to violence in darfur . " we will resume the interrupted strategic dialogue in the second half of the year , " said steinmeier , who is seen as a potential future candidate for chancellor . during a meeting with steinmeier , china 's premier wen jiabao said the perception of china in germany had recently improved and gave assurances that the political situation in his country was stable . germany promises 8 schools for quake-hit region the foreign minister pledged reconstruction aid to the earthquake-hit region of sichuan in south-western china and said that germany would help build eight schools in the area . in thanking steinmeier , premier wen said the contributions were a sign of a deep friendship between the countries . steinmeier is scheduled to visit the sichuan province on the weekend .
there he will meet with german aid workers who are helping the survivors of the quake , which left more than 86,000 people dead or missing . dalai lama visit forgiven and forgotten the foreign minister has distanced himself from german chancellor angela merkel 's decision to meet with the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , in berlin last september .
he has since been at the forefront of efforts to repair strained relations with china and refused to meet with the dalai lama when he returned to germany last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama had political consequences however , on friday steinmeier said he hoped the dialogue between china and representatives of the dalai lama would continue .
he added that it was important to germany that progress is made in preserving tibetan culture and religion . steinmeier has also been less vocal about china 's human rights record than the chancellor and has typically favored quiet diplomacy in china 's conflict with tibet . although the dalai lama has repeatedly said he does not advocate self-rule for tibet , an autonomous chinese province , china believes that he is trying to achieve independence and condemns on political grounds all foreign politicians who meet with him .
anger over merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama drove a wedge between the countries , which have established growing trade ties in recent years as the world 's top two exporters of goods . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.06.2008 germany tightens rules on violent computer games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlarged labelling will enable parents to see which computer games are violent two school massacres in germany have been linked to time spent playing violent computer games , prompting the german parliment to seek enlarged labelling on dvds warning parents . the upper house of the german parliament voted to tighten rules on the sales of violent computer games and films to minors on friday , june 13 , by providing guidelines on stricter labeling .
labels on dvds that indicate age-appropriate content need to be large enough so that parents and cashiers at the checkout counters can see at first glance if a game or movie is banned for underage minors and children . the move has been a response to school rampages in emsdetten and erfurt in which the perpetrators of the shooting sprees were apparently influenced by the violent computer game “ counter strike ” .
link between juvenile crime and school failure there is a correlation between juvenile crime and failure at school with the amount of time a youth spends playing violent computer games , according to one german study .
a school psychologist in munich , werner hopf , surveyed 653 schoolboys over two years , the hamburg-based magazine geo wissen reported .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "

they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .
" that is not an issue at all .
we just want to play well and will not be thinking about what happened 30 years ago , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "
other matches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia was jubilant croatia defeated germany 2-1 earlier in the evening and now ca n't be caught at the head of the group .
they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .
" that is not an issue at all .
we just want to play well and will not be thinking about what happened 30 years ago , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "
another cordoba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrians still love to remember cordoba together with her austrian counterpart alfred gusenbauer , german chancellor angela merkel will be attending the germany-austria game at euro 2008 in vienna on monday .
both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .
in addition , it is co-host of the tournament which makes expectations in the country even higher . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .
beckenbauer , who captained germany to its first of three euro titles in 1972 , was nonetheless optimistic , predicting that germans still have a good chance to advance into thursday 's knockout match with portugal .
proud croatia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer thinks germany could still make it meanwhile , croatia 's captain niko kovac insisted his team had earned their win , having dominated from start to finish .
kovac , who patrolled the midfield with authority and vigor and , who alongside new tottenham signing luka modric , got the better of germany 's much revered midfield pairing of michael ballack and torsten frings , said it was a fully deserved result .
" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "
another cordoba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austrians still love to remember cordoba together with her austrian counterpart alfred gusenbauer , german chancellor angela merkel will be attending the germany-austria game at euro 2008 in vienna on monday .
both teams are vying for a quarter-final berth at the euro tournament .
austria will be hoping for another miracle of cordoba - which occurred in 1978 when the first time in 47 years austria defeated germany 3-2 at the conclusion of the second round of the world cup .
" it was a piece of football history .
we are proud that we beat the big brother germany once in 49 years .
we will always talk about that when there is a germany-austria game , " austrian footballing legend hans krankl told dpa in the run-up to the tournament .
the two neighbors have met on 34 occasions , with germany holding the edge on 20 wins opposed to six draws and eight defeats .
this time around there will be more pressure on austria because it can advance into the quarter-finals with a victory .
in addition , it is co-host of the tournament which makes expectations in the country even higher . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .

" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .

" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .

the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .
at volkswagen , several former top managers of europe 's biggest carmaker have also been prosecuted after revelations in 2005 that they used a slush fund to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
earlier this year , klaus zumwinkel resigned as ceo of deutsche post ag after being charged with tax evasion in an wide-reaching investigation of offshore bank accounts that involves hundreds of germans .
last month , german prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations that deutsche telekom ag monitored telephone records to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws .
the german food discounter lidl was also charged for violating privacy laws by spying on its employees with video surveillance .
merkel warns of blanket condemnation however in an interview with the financial times earlier , merkel had also stressed the financial benefits that such firms bring to the country and warned against a blanket condemnation of all german businesses across the board .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after taking a big financial hit from the credit crisis , new york-based citigroup is considering spinning off its german banking unit . possible three-way merger with a large part of germany 's banking market in the hands of state banks that turn in a low return on equity , the country 's banks have been battling for years with low profitability . the moves by dresdner and commerzbank to forge a tie-up could be part of a prelude to the two frankfurt cross-town rivals launching what would be a three-way merger with postbank to form a new banking powerhouse in europe 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank brings 14 million private customers this would also represent a challenge to germany 's state-owned and cooperative banks which have a strangle hold on the nation 's retail banking business , controlling about two thirds of the market , and which have been a major stumbling bloc to any major industry restructuring . however , the fallout from the credit crisis has also helped to increase the pressure on germany 's state-owned banks to consider mergers , which could help to pave the way for freeing up the banking system for restructuring . postbank brings coveted customer base the postal and logistics group deutsche post , postbank 's parent , has indicated that it will make a final decision about selling off a big stake in its banking arm early in the second half of the year . with a customer base in germany of more than 14 million and a branch network of over 800 , postbank is considered a major prize in any battle over the future of the nation 's banking sector . allianz , dresdner and commerzbank declined to comment on thursday 's media report that they have launched moves towards forming a new banking group . but there are several possible new banking combinations that could emerge in the run-up to the end of the year with deutsche bank having also said it might to try to pick up postbank . learning from past banking flops however , despite the pressures for a restructuring of the german bank industry , the last major shakeout in the nation 's financial sector was in 2005 when italy 's biggest bank unicredit spa purchased munich-based hvb in what was europe 's biggest-ever cross-border banking deal . after the embarrassing and dramatic collapse eight years ago of deutsche bank 's ambitious 30-billion-dollars merger bid for dresdner , allianz stepped in about 12 months later to pick up dresdner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unicredit-hvb merger in 2005 was europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal this was part of an equally ambitious plan drawn up by allianz to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's network of more than 800 branches . now , with dresdner 's earnings feeling the pinch as a result of the global credit squeeze , allianz appears keen again to play a key role in helping to orchestrate a new wave of bank consolidation in germany - this time by offloading dresdner . " we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said allianz group financial officer helmut perlet after dresdner unveiled a first-quarter loss and allianz said it planned to break up its banking offshoot later this year . obstacles lie ahead for bank consolidators analysts see allianz as possibly spinning off dresdner to commerzbank with the new financial house then moving in to buy a controlling stake in postbank . the three-way merger would mean an expanded distribution network for allianz to sell its insurance and pension products . but as was the case in the past , those driving bank consolidation in germany face an uphill battle to bring about any far-reaching change in the nation 's finance sector . for one , even if dresdner and commerzbank did try to mount a merger with postbank they could face stiff competition from several foreign-owned heavyweights , including spain 's banco santander sa and the netherlands ' ing , which has already been seeking to make inroads into germany . moreover , the synergies and cost savings that executives would want to secure from a link up between postbank , dresdner and commerzbank could also mean them finding themselves facing tough union action to head off any cuts in the banks ' labor force . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .
the large majority of biodiesel imports to europe comes from the united states .
the amount has risen from 7,000 tonnes in 2005 to around a million tonnes last year . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .
the large majority of biodiesel imports to europe comes from the united states .

it can ’ t be healthy , he says , and it ’ s unbecoming . one-time tennis ace turned international playboy , boris becker does n't have a reputation for prudishness .
but in a recent interview with magazine gq , he complained that the way women tennis stars grunt during matches is too sexual .
not something one would expect such a notorious ladies man to grumble about , but presumably , he feels that everything has its time and place .
center court is for playing tennis , and if anyone wants to grunt , they should go elsewhere , such as a broom closet .
dis 'grunt 'led bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serena williams likes to let it all out " i 'm amazed whenever i watch serena williams and maria scharapova , " he carped , referring to the russian star who 's been called as noisy as a light aircraft .
with a ear-piercing yell that exceeds 100 decibels , she currently holds the record as the loudest woman in tennis .
" i ca n't help thinking it 's bad for their vocal chords .

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .
at volkswagen , several former top managers of europe 's biggest carmaker have also been prosecuted after revelations in 2005 that they used a slush fund to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
earlier this year , klaus zumwinkel resigned as ceo of deutsche post ag after being charged with tax evasion in an wide-reaching investigation of offshore bank accounts that involves hundreds of germans .
last month , german prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations that deutsche telekom ag monitored telephone records to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws .
the german food discounter lidl was also charged for violating privacy laws by spying on its employees with video surveillance .
merkel warns of blanket condemnation however in an interview with the financial times earlier , merkel had also stressed the financial benefits that such firms bring to the country and warned against a blanket condemnation of all german businesses across the board .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , with the german foreign minister in beijing , things seemed to have improved . relations between china and germany have normalized , china 's foreign minister yang jiechi told reporters on friday , june 13 , in beijing . " recently china-germany relations have already moved onto a track of normal development , " he said , calling german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's visit a " major event in china-germany relations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministers are all smiles steinmeier said that china and germany would restart discussions on key global issues , such as conflict prevention in africa and climate change , which had been suspended as a result of the dalai lama 's visit to germany .
china has been criticized in the west for not taking advantage of its influence in sudan to press for an end to violence in darfur . " we will resume the interrupted strategic dialogue in the second half of the year , " said steinmeier , who is seen as a potential future candidate for chancellor . during a meeting with steinmeier , china 's premier wen jiabao said the perception of china in germany had recently improved and gave assurances that the political situation in his country was stable . germany promises 8 schools for quake-hit region the foreign minister pledged reconstruction aid to the earthquake-hit region of sichuan in south-western china and said that germany would help build eight schools in the area . in thanking steinmeier , premier wen said the contributions were a sign of a deep friendship between the countries . steinmeier is scheduled to visit the sichuan province on the weekend .
there he will meet with german aid workers who are helping the survivors of the quake , which left more than 86,000 people dead or missing . dalai lama visit forgiven and forgotten the foreign minister has distanced himself from german chancellor angela merkel 's decision to meet with the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , in berlin last september .
he has since been at the forefront of efforts to repair strained relations with china and refused to meet with the dalai lama when he returned to germany last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama had political consequences however , on friday steinmeier said he hoped the dialogue between china and representatives of the dalai lama would continue .
he added that it was important to germany that progress is made in preserving tibetan culture and religion . steinmeier has also been less vocal about china 's human rights record than the chancellor and has typically favored quiet diplomacy in china 's conflict with tibet . although the dalai lama has repeatedly said he does not advocate self-rule for tibet , an autonomous chinese province , china believes that he is trying to achieve independence and condemns on political grounds all foreign politicians who meet with him .
anger over merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama drove a wedge between the countries , which have established growing trade ties in recent years as the world 's top two exporters of goods . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

labels on dvds that indicate age-appropriate content need to be large enough so that parents and cashiers at the checkout counters can see at first glance if a game or movie is banned for underage minors and children . the move has been a response to school rampages in emsdetten and erfurt in which the perpetrators of the shooting sprees were apparently influenced by the violent computer game “ counter strike ” .
link between juvenile crime and school failure there is a correlation between juvenile crime and failure at school with the amount of time a youth spends playing violent computer games , according to one german study .
a school psychologist in munich , werner hopf , surveyed 653 schoolboys over two years , the hamburg-based magazine geo wissen reported .
playing such computer games , in which boys pretend to kill and maim others , was the best predictor of which boys would get into trouble with police , although other factors included poverty , poor relationships with parents or growing up in a criminal environment .
boys playing violent games were far more likely to be charged with assault , vandalism , bullying and theft from vending machines and also more likely to perform poorly in school .

" when the time comes to welcome a new american president next january , i will be pleased to report to him that the relationship between the united states and europe is the broadest and most vibrant it has ever been , " bush said . on saturday , bush delivers the keynote address of his tour at the paris headquarters of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , emphasizing the need for us-european unity rather than a focus on disputes over climate change , afghanistan and ways to address terrorism . bush hails a " new era " the us leader said he had seen the shape of a " new era " of " a revitalized relationship between europe and america " in leaders like german chancellor angela merkel , french president nicolas sarkozy and prime ministers gordon brown of britain and silvio berlusconi of italy . " i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .
" we must go forward with unity .
dividing democracies is one of our enemies ' goals and they must not be allowed to succeed , " the said .
sarkozy seen as an ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and sarkozy enjoy a friendly relationship while sarkozy is a critic of many aspects of us foreign policy , the relationship between the two men is much friendlier than that of bush and sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac .
chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .
stealing bush 's thunder while bush spent thursday in rome with conservative ally berlusconi , his wife laura was in paris making a $ 10.2 billion us government commitment to help with reconstruction in afghanistan .
the donation still needs congressional approval .
the us help was announced at an international conference in the french capital which was being held to drum up support for vital improvements to the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 13.06.2008 france must conquer dutch man-mountain in bid for qualification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a big man to boss the italian midfield but dutch star engelaar managed it it was in the 51st minute of the netherlands-italy game that gennaro gattuso probably realized he had bitten off more than he could chew .
here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .
he told me that i could become a good footballer in the netherlands in a position behind the striker . "
engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .

engelaar 's form at twente did not go unnoticed by van basten , who gave him his international debut in a friendly against south korea on june 2 , 2007 .
a year later he looks a sound choice in a more defensive role .
rutten has now left twente to take over at schalke 04 after euro 2008 , and would dearly like to take his old captain with him .
the bundesliga club is interested in a deal but has been haggling with twente over a transfer demand of some 8 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , a price which could well now go up if engelaar and the dutch continue as they began against italy .
gallas promises a more attack-minded france the dutch will face a more attacking france side after a disappointing goalless draw against romania , france defender william gallas said ahead of the crucial game . gallas was in positive mood at the team 's training camp at chatel-st-denis , saying the team was still in a good position to progress from group c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guess who 's back ?
france were given a boost when captain patrick vieira and striker thierry henry came through a training match unscathed . both players missed monday 's 0-0 draw against romania in group c because of thigh injuries and hope to be back against the dutch in berne on friday . henry scored one goal and set up most of the others in a 7-0 run-out against a youth side in a 45-minute game at the stade de lussy in chatel-st-denis . gallas did not take part in the game as coach raymond domenech gave some of his reserves a run-out , including marseille 's 20-year-old sami nasri who bagged two goals . offensive dutch will provide more space , says gallas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallas , right , hopes the next match will be a happier one gallas predicted a better performance by the french when they come up against the netherlands . " it will be better for us to play against the dutch because they are more attacking and we will have more space than against romania , " he said . the 30-year-old arsenal captain had few problems at the back dealing with an unambitious romania side but expects a bigger challenge in berne on friday against a dutch outfit buoyed by the 3-0 defeat of world champions italy . gallas said domenech had wanted france to avoid defeat against romania and as a result les bleus began the tournament with caution . " we played with the brakes on because we did not want to concede a goal .
not only one player but the whole team will have to take the brakes off , " he said .
" i am confident .
it is a difficult group but we know we have the quality . " gallas added he was disappointed some french supporters began whistling during the game against romania .
" we need the supporters behind us to push us forward , " he said . gallas would have had no complaints about the several thousand , mainly local schoolchildren , who gave a noisy welcome to the team in the local chatel-st-denis ground nestled in the foothills of the alps . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was one of soccer 's hardmen facing an opponent who would not back down . gattusso , the rugged ac milan midfielder , knows how to intimidate opponents with his fierce tackling and uncompromising nature , but when he faced up to engelaar near the centre circle at the stade de suisse in berne , he resembled a terrier snarling at a doberman pinscher .
the italian number eight gave his dutch opposite number a quick slap just to prove his bite is still as dangerous as his bark , earning him a yellow card in italy 's disastrous group c start .
but at 1.96 meters and weighing more than 90 kilos , the muscular dutch midfield giant could almost take gattuso 's attention as a compliment .
by then engelaar and teammates had left their own mark on the italians , who were trailing by two goals .
now two-time european champions france , training in the swiss town of chatel-st-denis with the snow-peaked alps on the horizon , have this dutch mountain of a man facing them in berne on friday .
a big man to miss but the italians manage it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gattuso tries his luck with the more lightweight sneijder they probably did not have engelaar in their sights before the tournament started .
but while wesley sneijder and rafael van der vaart were shining in midfield against the italians , engelaar was going about his game in a noticeably neat and businesslike fashion to make one or two clubs around europe sit up .
engelaar was one of the few unknown quantities in marco van basten 's squad going into euro 2008 , and at the age of 28 was playing only his seventh game for the national side against italy .
after the withdrawal before the tournament of veteran clarence seedorf and with bayern munich 's mark van bommel also out of favor , van basten had been looking for someone to sit in midfield , shield the defense and distribute the ball .
engelaar helped fill the role alongside nigel de jong and appears to have solved a problem .
former dutch star ruud gullit had already predicted the late bloomer could be one of the tournament surprises , praising the player 's passing ability as well as his overall disciplined game .
dutch legend gullit knows his stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud gullit identified engelaar as a surprise star " at these kinds of tournaments , these days there are no real surprises - everybody knows everybody .
but we do have one guy in the dutch camp who will give people a surprise : orlando engelaar , " he said ahead of the tournament .
" he is a good player , no , a really good player , a playmaker .
he is a big , powerful guy and uses the ball very well ... engelaar could be a surprise for many people . "
engelaar is , in fact , an erstwhile striker who played for his local rotterdam club feyenoord in his youth but whose career had since faltered somewhat .
he left the netherlands to play for genk in neighboring belgium , but returned in the summer of 2006 to the netherlands to join twente enschede .
position switch was a turning point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former defender , engelaar now dominates midfield it proved to be the turning point .
twente coach fred rutten persuaded engelaar to play in midfield where he was made captain and led the team to champions league qualification .
" fred rutten has given me the chance to develop myself , " engelaar told de telegraaf newspaper .
" he picked me up when i had a less productive period at racing genk .

" when the time comes to welcome a new american president next january , i will be pleased to report to him that the relationship between the united states and europe is the broadest and most vibrant it has ever been , " bush said . on saturday , bush delivers the keynote address of his tour at the paris headquarters of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , emphasizing the need for us-european unity rather than a focus on disputes over climate change , afghanistan and ways to address terrorism . bush hails a " new era " the us leader said he had seen the shape of a " new era " of " a revitalized relationship between europe and america " in leaders like german chancellor angela merkel , french president nicolas sarkozy and prime ministers gordon brown of britain and silvio berlusconi of italy . " i see a commitment to a powerful and purposeful europe that advances the values of liberty within its borders , and beyond , " bush said .
" the rise of free and prosperous societies in the broader middle east is essential to peace in the 21st century , just as the rise of a free and prosperous europe was essential to peace in the 20th century , " he said . " europe and america must stand with reformers , democratic leaders , and millions of ordinary people across the middle east who seek a future of hope , liberty , and peace in afghanistan , lebanon , the holy land , iran and syria - and iraq , " he added .
the us president is to see pope benedict xvi on friday before traveling to france . bush 's week-long trip has been aimed at bolstering unity among skeptical european allies for the war in afghanistan and rebuilding efforts in iraq .
" we must go forward with unity .
dividing democracies is one of our enemies ' goals and they must not be allowed to succeed , " the said .
sarkozy seen as an ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and sarkozy enjoy a friendly relationship while sarkozy is a critic of many aspects of us foreign policy , the relationship between the two men is much friendlier than that of bush and sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac .
chirac opposed the war in iraq and clashed with bush over climate change and other matters .
sarkozy , by contrast , has promised that the united states " can count on our friendship , " while maintaining his right to differ from bush on issues such as iraq .
in an interview broadcast on french television on thursday , bush spoke of sarkozy as his " friend " and noted the " excellent " relations between france and the united states , which have enjoyed a significant upswing since sarkozy 's election in may last year .
bush has been intent on having a friendlier relationship with sarkozy , inviting him to a barbecue at the family seaside home in kennebunkport , maine , last summer .
" he 's bringing a good brain , good vision and goodwill , " bush said not long after sarkozy was elected to office .
stealing bush 's thunder while bush spent thursday in rome with conservative ally berlusconi , his wife laura was in paris making a $ 10.2 billion us government commitment to help with reconstruction in afghanistan .
the donation still needs congressional approval .
the us help was announced at an international conference in the french capital which was being held to drum up support for vital improvements to the country .
" afghanistan has reached a decisive moment for its future .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .

austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .

the result ensured croatia a place in the quarter-finals as winners of the group with one match still to play .
poland looked to be on the way to victory thanks to a first-half goal from roger guerreiro .
the brazilian-born attacking midfielder who only obtained polish citizenship in april , scored from close range in the 30th minute after austria had squandered a series of chances .
martin harnik had an excellent chance to open the scoring in the 13th minute as he found himself one-on-one with polish goalkeeper artur boruc , but the celtic custodian got the better of him .
two minutes later harnik had another chance , before christoph leitgeb had another one-on-one with boruc and again the keeper could not be beaten .
against the odds unexpectedly , poland suddenly were ahead .
austrian coach josef hickersberger said that it was a situation that often happened .
" you create several chances , but fail to score them , but then it is the other side that scores , " he said .
four minutes after the re-start austria had a penalty appeal turned down by english referee howard webb who ruled that andreas ivanschitz had not been pulled down in the area .
in injury time austria received a freekick in midfield which webb decided should be retaken after it had been cleared .
the ball was floated into the area , where mariusz lewandowski pulled down sebastian proedl .
this time webb pointed to the spot and vastic finally beat boruc .
in doing so , he became the oldest player in the history of the competition to score a goal at the finals .
feeling cheated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vastic celebrates after his penalty goal poland 's dutch coach leo beenhakker criticised webb for awarding the spot kick .
" i did not see a penalty - did you ? " he asked journalists after the match .
" first he had the free-kick repeated for a situation that you have hundreds of times in games .
the he gives a penalty for a wrestling situation that you also have all the time .
of course we feel cheated . "
he said that he did not believe that his team still had a chance to stay in the competition .
" we deserved better because we are a good side , " he said .
" if we had won , i would have thought we still had a chance . "

they have six points , with germany on three and poland and austria with one apiece .
austria will have to beat germany in vienna on monday to have any chance of qualifying , while poland will need to beat croatia the same evening in klagenfurt .
hickersberger said that playing against germany would be a terrific experience .
" i know germany very well .
playing against them is always something special . "
he dismissed comparisons with the match between the two sides at the 1978 world cup finals , which germany needed do draw to advance to the play-off for third place , but which austria won .

the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .
the large majority of biodiesel imports to europe comes from the united states .

germany , which likes to tout itself as the land of poets and thinkers , must once again " become the republic of education , " merkel said in a speech .
" prosperity for all means education for all . "

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .

earlier this year , klaus zumwinkel resigned as ceo of deutsche post ag after being charged with tax evasion in an wide-reaching investigation of offshore bank accounts that involves hundreds of germans .
last month , german prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations that deutsche telekom ag monitored telephone records to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws .
the german food discounter lidl was also charged for violating privacy laws by spying on its employees with video surveillance .
merkel warns of blanket condemnation however in an interview with the financial times earlier , merkel had also stressed the financial benefits that such firms bring to the country and warned against a blanket condemnation of all german businesses across the board .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , with the german foreign minister in beijing , things seemed to have improved . relations between china and germany have normalized , china 's foreign minister yang jiechi told reporters on friday , june 13 , in beijing . " recently china-germany relations have already moved onto a track of normal development , " he said , calling german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's visit a " major event in china-germany relations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign ministers are all smiles steinmeier said that china and germany would restart discussions on key global issues , such as conflict prevention in africa and climate change , which had been suspended as a result of the dalai lama 's visit to germany .
china has been criticized in the west for not taking advantage of its influence in sudan to press for an end to violence in darfur . " we will resume the interrupted strategic dialogue in the second half of the year , " said steinmeier , who is seen as a potential future candidate for chancellor . during a meeting with steinmeier , china 's premier wen jiabao said the perception of china in germany had recently improved and gave assurances that the political situation in his country was stable . germany promises 8 schools for quake-hit region the foreign minister pledged reconstruction aid to the earthquake-hit region of sichuan in south-western china and said that germany would help build eight schools in the area . in thanking steinmeier , premier wen said the contributions were a sign of a deep friendship between the countries . steinmeier is scheduled to visit the sichuan province on the weekend .
there he will meet with german aid workers who are helping the survivors of the quake , which left more than 86,000 people dead or missing . dalai lama visit forgiven and forgotten the foreign minister has distanced himself from german chancellor angela merkel 's decision to meet with the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , in berlin last september .
he has since been at the forefront of efforts to repair strained relations with china and refused to meet with the dalai lama when he returned to germany last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama had political consequences however , on friday steinmeier said he hoped the dialogue between china and representatives of the dalai lama would continue .
he added that it was important to germany that progress is made in preserving tibetan culture and religion . steinmeier has also been less vocal about china 's human rights record than the chancellor and has typically favored quiet diplomacy in china 's conflict with tibet . although the dalai lama has repeatedly said he does not advocate self-rule for tibet , an autonomous chinese province , china believes that he is trying to achieve independence and condemns on political grounds all foreign politicians who meet with him .
anger over merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama drove a wedge between the countries , which have established growing trade ties in recent years as the world 's top two exporters of goods . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' " jogi -lrb- nickname of german coach joachim loew -rrb- , this debacle has made us afraid , " it wrote on friday , june 13 .
" now we have to hope and fear , " it added , referring to next monday 's crunch match against neighbors austria , where defeat would mean an early exit for germany .
" indecisive , heavy-legged , mentally not at the races , " was how the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung explained the descent of the favorites .
" it is not so much the result but the way the match played out which surprised and horrified us , and it is that which the coach must address . "
it could have been a lot worse for the germans , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" germany was lucky that the score was n't a lot worse , " it wrote .
for the berliner zeitung daily there was nothing but danger ahead for the three-time champions .
" even if germany reaches the last eight , lying in wait is a portuguese side who won its second match with bravura , " it wrote .
" the question to pose is if germany will succeed in getting back on the rails quickly .
because normally if the second match at a major finals goes badly then the third one is often the last one , " it gloomily predicted .
still optimistic writing in bild , german football icon franz beckenbauer said that he had never expected a disaster on this scale , just four days after the team 's 2-0 victory against poland .
" i have rarely seen such contrasting showings , " he railed .
" i said after the poland match that we do n't have to fear any one if we play like this , ” he recalled .
" after this defeat it 's the other way around : we have to be afraid of austria if we play like this , " he said .

" i do think we were the team that deserved the victory .
we were the better team , we had better opportunities , " he said .
" we played the way the germans played in their first game , with lots of discipline , with control . "
kovac explained that it was easier for the croatians to play as underdogs against germany rather than as overwhelming favorites against the austrians , reported afp .
" the germans do play a different kind of football , more rational , ” he said .
" all victories are nice and germany are one of the favorites for the euro and when you beat germany , it 's obviously a big deal . "

ireland 's prime minister brian cowen said there could be " no quick fix " after his country voted down the lisbon treaty , which was designed to replace the eu constitution torpedoed by french and dutch voters three years ago .
" we must not rush to conclusions ...
the union has been in this situation before and each time has found an agreed way forward , " he said , shortly after figures confirmed the " no " victory with 53.4 percent of votes .
" there is no quick fix , " he added .
eu commission president jose manuel barroso on friday invited the bloc 's remaining member states to go ahead and ratify the lisbon treaty , in spite of its rejection by voters in ireland .
" the remaining ratification processes should maintain their course , " barroso told reporters in brussels .
eight national parliaments still need to ratify it , including those of britain , the netherlands and italy .
" the treaty is alive , and we should now try to find a solution , " barroso said .
mps watch from irish pub bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland was the only country in the 27-member bloc to hold a referendum a number of officials decided to follow the vote count on a giant screen at kitty o 'shea 's irish pub , a popular hang-out next to the commission 's headquarters . " i am very disappointed , especially when you consider all that the eu has done for ireland , " its publican said .

after taking a big financial hit from the credit crisis , new york-based citigroup is considering spinning off its german banking unit . possible three-way merger with a large part of germany 's banking market in the hands of state banks that turn in a low return on equity , the country 's banks have been battling for years with low profitability . the moves by dresdner and commerzbank to forge a tie-up could be part of a prelude to the two frankfurt cross-town rivals launching what would be a three-way merger with postbank to form a new banking powerhouse in europe 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank brings 14 million private customers this would also represent a challenge to germany 's state-owned and cooperative banks which have a strangle hold on the nation 's retail banking business , controlling about two thirds of the market , and which have been a major stumbling bloc to any major industry restructuring . however , the fallout from the credit crisis has also helped to increase the pressure on germany 's state-owned banks to consider mergers , which could help to pave the way for freeing up the banking system for restructuring . postbank brings coveted customer base the postal and logistics group deutsche post , postbank 's parent , has indicated that it will make a final decision about selling off a big stake in its banking arm early in the second half of the year . with a customer base in germany of more than 14 million and a branch network of over 800 , postbank is considered a major prize in any battle over the future of the nation 's banking sector . allianz , dresdner and commerzbank declined to comment on thursday 's media report that they have launched moves towards forming a new banking group . but there are several possible new banking combinations that could emerge in the run-up to the end of the year with deutsche bank having also said it might to try to pick up postbank . learning from past banking flops however , despite the pressures for a restructuring of the german bank industry , the last major shakeout in the nation 's financial sector was in 2005 when italy 's biggest bank unicredit spa purchased munich-based hvb in what was europe 's biggest-ever cross-border banking deal . after the embarrassing and dramatic collapse eight years ago of deutsche bank 's ambitious 30-billion-dollars merger bid for dresdner , allianz stepped in about 12 months later to pick up dresdner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unicredit-hvb merger in 2005 was europe 's biggest cross-border banking deal this was part of an equally ambitious plan drawn up by allianz to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's network of more than 800 branches . now , with dresdner 's earnings feeling the pinch as a result of the global credit squeeze , allianz appears keen again to play a key role in helping to orchestrate a new wave of bank consolidation in germany - this time by offloading dresdner . " we will make an active contribution to this consolidation , " said allianz group financial officer helmut perlet after dresdner unveiled a first-quarter loss and allianz said it planned to break up its banking offshoot later this year . obstacles lie ahead for bank consolidators analysts see allianz as possibly spinning off dresdner to commerzbank with the new financial house then moving in to buy a controlling stake in postbank . the three-way merger would mean an expanded distribution network for allianz to sell its insurance and pension products . but as was the case in the past , those driving bank consolidation in germany face an uphill battle to bring about any far-reaching change in the nation 's finance sector . for one , even if dresdner and commerzbank did try to mount a merger with postbank they could face stiff competition from several foreign-owned heavyweights , including spain 's banco santander sa and the netherlands ' ing , which has already been seeking to make inroads into germany . moreover , the synergies and cost savings that executives would want to secure from a link up between postbank , dresdner and commerzbank could also mean them finding themselves facing tough union action to head off any cuts in the banks ' labor force . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .
the defender was substituted for nicolae dica . romania nearly took the lead in the 17th minute after mutu was sent through , but the fiorentina striker failed to beat the advancing buffon . three minutes later the romanians had another opportunity as a christian chivu free kick took a deflection off panucci but crashed against the post . italy comes back italy enjoyed a very strong spell shortly before the break as lobont pulled off some breathtaking stops from luca toni and giorgio chiellini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's luca toni , right , heads the ball in first-half injury time toni finally had the ball in the back of the net after a header following a zambrotta free kick , but referee tom henning oevreboe ruled the attempt offside . early in the second half , romania finally broke the deadlock after a disastrous attempt at a header to his own goalkeeper by zambrotta .
the ball fell short and mutu was on hand to smash the ball past buffon . the lead lasted just a minute though as chiellini headed the ball into the area after a corner and after several romanian defenders failed to clear , it fell to panucci , who was standing just a meter or so from the line and had a simple task of pushing the ball into the net . italy pushed in search of a winner and in the 75th minute daniele de rossi forced a world-class save from lobont after being set up by toni . however , it was romania who had the best opportunity to snatch all three points but buffon was up to mutu 's penalty . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result sees romania , who played out a scoreless draw france their opening match , move on to two points . donadoni rang the changes for this match , making five changes from the side that lost so heavily to the dutch . determination both sides went into the game knowing that a defeat would probably mean the end of their euro hopes and the teams played attacking football in the first half , creating several chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's andrea pirlo , right , challenges for the ball the romanians were weakened in the 22nd minute after mirel radoi had to be stretchered off with a head injury after colliding with a teammate .

" dear industry representatives : take care that our community 's rules of play are adhered to at the highest level , " merkel said at an event attended by top managers of german companies .
" every irresponsible colleague in your circles endangers the basis of our liberal society , " merkel said .
one scandal after the other many of german 's top dax conglomerates have been engulfed in corporate scandals lately .
the former ceo of siemens heinrich von pierer , who had also been a technical advisor to merkel , is currently on trial in court proceedings related to a 1.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- bribery and corruption scandal that came to light two years ago .
although prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , von pierer could be fined for negligence in supervising company affairs .
at volkswagen , several former top managers of europe 's biggest carmaker have also been prosecuted after revelations in 2005 that they used a slush fund to pay for holidays and prostitutes .
earlier this year , klaus zumwinkel resigned as ceo of deutsche post ag after being charged with tax evasion in an wide-reaching investigation of offshore bank accounts that involves hundreds of germans .
last month , german prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations that deutsche telekom ag monitored telephone records to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws .
the german food discounter lidl was also charged for violating privacy laws by spying on its employees with video surveillance .
merkel warns of blanket condemnation however in an interview with the financial times earlier , merkel had also stressed the financial benefits that such firms bring to the country and warned against a blanket condemnation of all german businesses across the board .
" this is a heavy burden because it shakes confidence in our institutions - and companies like telekom and siemens are almost institutions in germany .
such isolated cases must be thoroughly and decisively investigated , " merkel told the paper . " but our criticism should not be understood as a blanket condemnation of business , " she added .
" these provide hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country .
my patriotic sensitivity tells me i must stand by these companies in tough times .
we must lead them onto the path of virtue , no question , but one should not condemn them en masse . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new alternative biofuels to benefit from eu 's reduced quotas biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ? science edges towards a new generation of biofuels economy -pipe- 13.06.2008 eu launches inquiry into us biofuel imports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils such as rapeseed the european union is launching formal anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of biofuel from the us , european sources said . the move came after the european commission investigated industry complaints that us support for biofuel producers was hitting europe 's industry .
the european biodiesel board called for the investigation starting friday , june 13 two months ago , complaining that the european market was being flooded with us exports of a 99-percent biodiesel blend , which can receive a subsidy of 192 euros -lrb- $ 300 -rrb- per ton .
on top of the us aid , exports of the so-called b99 blend are eligible for a subsidy in europe as well .
close to breaking point the lobby said the subsidies were squeezing european producers ' profit margins , putting most of them out of business and leaving capacity idle .
according to the times online , producers have implored brussels to carry out the inquiry as quickly as possible to save the european industry .
the commission feels that the complaints fulfil the requirements of the eu 's basic anti-subsidy and anti-dumping regulations in order to initiate further proceedings , one european source told afp .
the commission will look at us federal excise and income tax credits as well as federal grants to finance increased production capacity and state-level subsidy programmes .
it is expected to have made provisional findings by march next year , which it will then present to the 27 eu member states , the sources said . if it transpires that unfair subsidies and dumping are occurring , then us imports will face a steep hike in duties .
the biofuel backlash biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils or fats - including used cooking oils - with properties similar to petrol-based diesel .
the use of biofuels has come under growing attack recently in both the united states and europe , where they have been blamed for helping to drive food prices to record highs by using up farmland that could be used for food crops .
as a result , the european union has faced growing pressure to reconsider a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of all vehicle fuels in the 27-nation bloc by 2020 .
for the european industry the stakes are high , as biodiesel makes up 80 percent of the eu 's total production of biofuels .
the large majority of biodiesel imports to europe comes from the united states .
the amount has risen from 7,000 tonnes in 2005 to around a million tonnes last year . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the welsh assembly commission guidelines were looked at by legal experts who said the human rights act may also be breached .
leighton andrews , the rhondda am , said politicians ' views were being censored and described the guidelines as absurd .
a spokesman said the guidelines would be withdrawn and redrafted .
mr andrews , a deputy minister in the welsh assembly government , had pressed for the legal advice over the guidelines .
he said he had been contacted by 20 other assembly members who urged him to challenge the guidelines .
the legal advice said the guidelines lacked clarity or any logical basis and were unworkable .
" this is a victory for common sense and freedom of speech , " said mr andrews .
" the guidance will now have to be withdrawn , and as a consequence all assembly members are able once again to communicate openly and honestly with their constituents , without fear of repercussion . "

this was to be extended to websites .
but the legal advice from barrister graham walters said : " the purported distinction between assembly business on the one hand and political activities ... on the other seems to lack any logical basis and to be unworkable . "
the advice also said the guidance would not satisfy article 10 of the european convention on human rights .

it is not until he shows me his olympic medal that his mood lightens .
" this is special not just for me " , he says .
" it 's special also for my country because this is the first medal that we won in the olympics . "
somayli is going to beijing as director of the saudi sprint team and , like every saudi olympic official and athlete , he is a man .
saudi arabia is one of the few countries that does not allow women to take part in the olympics , or any other major sporting event .
court pioneers we are not asking for something that is against our culture or against our religion lina al-maeena jeddah united " some events are difficult for us , with the clothes , " says somayli .
" events like track and field , swimming , even football . "
" i hope in the other events we will see saudi women compete and soon . "
sport is banned at girls state schools .
there is no federation that organises women 's sport and few stadia that are open to them .
however , there are pioneers .
" we we are not official or approved of , " says danaya al-maeena co-founder of jeddah united basketball team .
" it is a challenge and it is the beginning of something that we really believe in . "

advertisement women on their hopes that the authorities will allow more women 's sport jeddah united hope to promote basketball among young saudis who may one day be able to compete internationally .
for now they provide an opportunity for people to have a few hours of sport every week .
" a lot of the women were depressed and this just lifts them up .
it gives them a sense of meaning and belonging , " said danaya al-maeena .
veiled sprinter the women of jeddah united exemplify how reform is slowly coming - led young people who want the country to modernise in a way consistent with the teachings of islam .
" we are not asking for something against our culture or our religion , " said danaya 's sister lina .
" all of the arab and muslim countries around the world have women competing and a few years ago we had the bahraini 100m runner who ran in her veil .
" these people should realise we can compete within our religious and cultural framework . "
saudi arabia 's first medal winner , 400m runner hadi souan somayli the most senior saudi clerics do not seem to agree .
in march the grand mufti ordered a riyadh university to cancel a women 's marathon .
religious leaders banned a football match last year .
but things are changing .
this year arwa mutabagani was the first saudi woman to be appointed as a top sports administrator , at the equestrian federation .
at a centre ms mutabagani set-up in jeddah , abdullah al-shurbatly canters around the arena watched by a few young women .
the dashing young equestrian will compete this summer in beijing on his english horse , hugo , and is one of the big saudi medal hopes .
behind these high walls other young women are also learning to ride .
" only 50 girls are riding and they are not that good , because here in the national shows they are not allowed to ride , " he said .
" when they compete in europe and start to do competitions and train hard they are going to get better . "
no-one from the saudi olympic committee was available for interview , but the international olympic committee is thought to be putting increasing pressure on them to include women in the future .
london 2012 may therefore see saudi women olympians for the first time .
if not , it is conceivable the kingdom may not be allowed to enter an all-male team .

" only 50 girls are riding and they are not that good , because here in the national shows they are not allowed to ride , " he said .
" when they compete in europe and start to do competitions and train hard they are going to get better . "

london 2012 may therefore see saudi women olympians for the first time .
if not , it is conceivable the kingdom may not be allowed to enter an all-male team .

he led for 399 metres but at the finishing line us sprinter angelo taylor surged forward to take gold .
when i suggest we watch the race together his face darkens .
it is not until he shows me his olympic medal that his mood lightens .
" this is special not just for me " , he says .
" it 's special also for my country because this is the first medal that we won in the olympics . "
somayli is going to beijing as director of the saudi sprint team and , like every saudi olympic official and athlete , he is a man .
saudi arabia is one of the few countries that does not allow women to take part in the olympics , or any other major sporting event .
court pioneers we are not asking for something that is against our culture or against our religion lina al-maeena jeddah united " some events are difficult for us , with the clothes , " says somayli .
" events like track and field , swimming , even football . "
" i hope in the other events we will see saudi women compete and soon . "
sport is banned at girls state schools .
there is no federation that organises women 's sport and few stadia that are open to them .
however , there are pioneers .
" we we are not official or approved of , " says danaya al-maeena co-founder of jeddah united basketball team .
" it is a challenge and it is the beginning of something that we really believe in . "

advertisement women on their hopes that the authorities will allow more women 's sport jeddah united hope to promote basketball among young saudis who may one day be able to compete internationally .
for now they provide an opportunity for people to have a few hours of sport every week .
" a lot of the women were depressed and this just lifts them up .
it gives them a sense of meaning and belonging , " said danaya al-maeena .
veiled sprinter the women of jeddah united exemplify how reform is slowly coming - led young people who want the country to modernise in a way consistent with the teachings of islam .
" we are not asking for something against our culture or our religion , " said danaya 's sister lina .
" all of the arab and muslim countries around the world have women competing and a few years ago we had the bahraini 100m runner who ran in her veil .
" these people should realise we can compete within our religious and cultural framework . "
saudi arabia 's first medal winner , 400m runner hadi souan somayli the most senior saudi clerics do not seem to agree .
in march the grand mufti ordered a riyadh university to cancel a women 's marathon .
religious leaders banned a football match last year .
but things are changing .
this year arwa mutabagani was the first saudi woman to be appointed as a top sports administrator , at the equestrian federation .
at a centre ms mutabagani set-up in jeddah , abdullah al-shurbatly canters around the arena watched by a few young women .
the dashing young equestrian will compete this summer in beijing on his english horse , hugo , and is one of the big saudi medal hopes .
behind these high walls other young women are also learning to ride .
" only 50 girls are riding and they are not that good , because here in the national shows they are not allowed to ride , " he said .
" when they compete in europe and start to do competitions and train hard they are going to get better . "
no-one from the saudi olympic committee was available for interview , but the international olympic committee is thought to be putting increasing pressure on them to include women in the future .
london 2012 may therefore see saudi women olympians for the first time .
if not , it is conceivable the kingdom may not be allowed to enter an all-male team .

the lib dems are not taking part in the by-election in haltemprice and howden , while labour has yet to decide .
mr davis said the government was facing a test of " nerve " over its plans to extend detentions for terror suspects .
but home secretary jacqui smith said the resignation showed the conservatives were in " disarray " .
mr davis said he would fight the by-election campaigning against the government 's plans to extend pre-charge detentions for terror suspects to a maximum of 42 days .
' their issue ' the proposal passed through the commons on wednesday by a margin of nine votes , against the opposition of the tories , lib dems and 36 labour mps .
mr davis said : " it would be very unlikely that the labour party would n't stand .
" this is their issue ...
if they do n't , what does it show about their nerve ?
what matters is the principles that we are dealing with here . "
at the last general election , in 2005 , mr davis was re-elected in haltemprice and howden with a 5,116 majority , with the lib dems second and labour third .
bbc political editor nick robinson said his resignation was an extraordinary move almost without precedent in british politics . "
this can not go on .
it must be stopped and for that reason today i feel it is incumbent on me to make a stand " david davis analysis : high-risk strategy a profile of david davis will davis face a challenge ?
so far no party has said it will put up a candidate against mr davis - the lib dems say they support him on terror detention and labour is still deciding whether to take part in what some of its mps have described as a " stunt " .
the bnp , which came fourth in the seat in the 2005 general election , says it will not stand against mr davis as it agrees with his stance on terror detention .
ukip , which was fifth , said it was still considering its position , although one of its meps , godfrey bloom , has offered to campaign for mr davis .
if no other candidate has come forward by the close of nominations , mr davis would be returned as the mp without a vote .
' personal decision ' he has led the opposition to labour 's plans to extend the maximum limit terror suspects can be held beyond the current 28-day maximum .
on wednesday , mr davis accused the government of " buying " the nine votes they needed to get the legislation through the commons .
he vowed that the conservatives , who are the official opposition and favourites to win at the next election , would continue the fight in the house of lords .

their reception , on the italian riviera , was capped with a spectacular midnight firework display , reported to have cost in the region of £ 50,000 .
but the manchester united footballer and his childhood sweetheart stayed away from photographers and reporters .
pictures from their wedding have been sold to ok ! magazine - which is believed to have paid the couple £ 2.5m.
the assembled paparazzi scored an early victory with a snatched picture of the bride in her wedding dress , stepping off the yacht where she spent her last night as a single woman , shielded from the torrential rain by a large black umbrella .
gianni costa , the deputy mayor of santa margherita ligure who conducted the wedding ceremony , seemed blissfully unaware of the couple 's exclusive deal - and was happy to describe the union to journalists .
' very beautiful ' he said the bride wore a white dress and pearls , while the groom wore a hazel-coloured suit with an open-necked shirt .
the white marchesa wedding gown is believed to have cost £ 200,000 .
" no rings were exchanged , and the ceremony was very simple , yet very beautiful , " mr costa added .
" everyone was very emotional and there were a few tears from everyone , especially the bride , but wayne was very composed . "
after the ceremony the couple - both 22 - were given a police escort in two cars with blacked-out windows for the short journey to the abbey of la cervara .
the abbey , which has hosted three popes and imprisoned a french king during its 650-year history , was the setting for the rooneys ' wedding reception .
it climaxed with an eight-and-a-half-minute firework display , launched from a pontoon in the bay below the abbey .
" glittering fountains of pink and green stars shimmered on the sea below , " said bbc reporter jane prendergast .

their reception , on the italian riviera , was capped with a spectacular midnight firework display , reported to have cost in the region of £ 50,000 .
but the manchester united footballer and his childhood sweetheart stayed away from photographers and reporters .
pictures from their wedding have been sold to ok ! magazine - which is believed to have paid the couple £ 2.5m.
the assembled paparazzi scored an early victory with a snatched picture of the bride in her wedding dress , stepping off the yacht where she spent her last night as a single woman , shielded from the torrential rain by a large black umbrella .
gianni costa , the deputy mayor of santa margherita ligure who conducted the wedding ceremony , seemed blissfully unaware of the couple 's exclusive deal - and was happy to describe the union to journalists .
' very beautiful ' he said the bride wore a white dress and pearls , while the groom wore a hazel-coloured suit with an open-necked shirt .
the white marchesa wedding gown is believed to have cost £ 200,000 .
the firework display rounded off the couple 's wedding day " no rings were exchanged , and the ceremony was very simple , yet very beautiful , " mr costa added .
" everyone was very emotional and there were a few tears from everyone , especially the bride , but wayne was very composed . "
after the ceremony the couple - both 22 - were given a police escort in two cars with blacked-out windows for the short journey to the abbey of la cervara .
the abbey , which has hosted three popes and imprisoned a french king during its 650-year history , was the setting for the rooneys ' wedding reception .
it climaxed with an eight-and-a-half-minute firework display , launched from a pontoon in the bay below the abbey .
" glittering fountains of pink and green stars shimmered on the sea below , " said bbc reporter jane prendergast .

but the manchester united footballer and his childhood sweetheart stayed away from photographers and reporters .
pictures from their wedding have been sold to ok ! magazine - which is believed to have paid the couple £ 2.5m.
the assembled paparazzi scored an early victory with a snatched picture of the bride in her wedding dress , stepping off the yacht where she spent her last night as a single woman , shielded from the torrential rain by a large black umbrella .
gianni costa , the deputy mayor of santa margherita ligure who conducted the wedding ceremony , seemed blissfully unaware of the couple 's exclusive deal - and was happy to describe the union to journalists .
' very beautiful ' he said the bride wore a white dress and pearls , while the groom wore a hazel-coloured suit with an open-necked shirt .
the white marchesa wedding gown is believed to have cost £ 200,000 .
the firework display rounded off the couple 's wedding day " no rings were exchanged , and the ceremony was very simple , yet very beautiful , " mr costa added .
" everyone was very emotional and there were a few tears from everyone , especially the bride , but wayne was very composed . "
after the ceremony the couple - both 22 - were given a police escort in two cars with blacked-out windows for the short journey to the abbey of la cervara .
the abbey , which has hosted three popes and imprisoned a french king during its 650-year history , was the setting for the rooneys ' wedding reception .
it climaxed with an eight-and-a-half-minute firework display , launched from a pontoon in the bay below the abbey .
" glittering fountains of pink and green stars shimmered on the sea below , " said bbc reporter jane prendergast .

wholesale price inflation rose 8.75 % in the 12 months to 31 may , rising from the previous week 's 8.24 % and above analyst forecasts .
the inflation rate is now at its highest since february 2001 and well above the government 's target of between 5 % and 5.5 % .
the rising cost of food and oil are pressuring prices and interest rates are expected to rise .
the central bank has already raised rates to combat inflation , lifting its key lending rate by 25 basis points to 8 % this week , its first rise in a year .
analysts fear inflation could exceed 9 % , a 13-year high .
" with this kind of galloping inflation one can not rule out the possibility of it touching double digits ... in coming months , " said rupa rege nitsure , chief economist at bank of baroda .
political tension ministers recently raised petrol and diesel prices by about 10 % , sparking fears about fuel affordability and resulting in social unrest .
india imports nearly 75 % of its crude oil requirements but subsidises the cost of domestic fuel products to help contain inflation and protect the poor .
oil prices are a sensitive political issue in india as even a small rise in the price of diesel can feed into much higher food and transport prices .
with the governing party is facing elections in a number of states this year , the congress party-led federal government had been wary of increasing fuel prices for fear of antagonising voters .
but india 's three state run-oil importing , refining and marketing companies have been losing huge sums of money as they have been unable to raise prices .
energy costs make up 14.2 % of the inflation index .
in addition to fuel and food price rises , some analysts have forecast that transport and feedstock costs will rise within the next two to three months .

jon sopel presenter the politics show hello again there have been some extraordinary weeks in politics , but this one is right up there with the best of them .
david davis : action stunned parliament and voters alike just when the story seemed to be labour disarray -lrb- part 94 -rrb- after the government scraped home in the vote on 42 day detention , amid tales of skulduggery , dodgy deals , and e-bay auctioning of mps principles , along comes the tory big beast david davis .
by resigning his seat and forcing a by-election - clearly never part of david cameron 's script - the story could easily become one of conservative turmoil .
i 'll be joined on sunday by the culture secretary and up-and-coming cabinet minister andy burnham to chew over the week 's events .
no gcse in politics it 's weeks like these which make the study of politics such a joy .
so let me introduce you to jon , josh and ben .
politician lobbies pupils ... but no gcse in politics they are all teenage pupils in oxfordshire who were dismayed to learn that they could n't take a gcse in politics -lrb- at the moment no such exam exists -rrb- .
so they wrote to us to try to fix it .
enter our reporter max cotton and an array of leading mps from all three main parties .
see for yourselves how they get on .
find a solution incidentally , the " fix it for us " theme will be something we 'll be featuring regularly on the programme in future - taking up your concerns on any political issue , large or small , and trying to bring policy-makers and people together to find a solution for you .
so write to us at politicsshow @ bbc.co.uk and get max working on your behalf .
free schools back to the subject of pupils , we 'll be examining the conservatives ' big idea for education : free schools .
where will the tories take the school bus ?
at the end of a week in which failing schools - and measures to tackle them - have been making headlines , we followed the gaze of envious tory eyes to sweden .
there , anyone can set up a new school , no matter how small , and with a cash incentive for every child a school takes on , it 's the parents who choose the school not the other way round .
so is it acceptable for companies to make a profit from education ?
and does this mark a quiet return to the pupil passport system that conservatives abandoned in 2005 ?
we 'll ask the shadow schools minister nick gibb about that .
so many topics , so many questions : join us at noon on sunday 15 june on bbc one to learn - we hope - so many answers .

the city council said it would spend up to £ 120,000 using thousands of leaflets , plastic bags and parking tickets to ask for people 's views .
it follows the government 's decision that the city 's system of an elected mayor and council manager should end .
the two possible options to replace it are an elected mayor with a cabinet , or a council leader with a cabinet .
the campaign will include an opinion poll and public meetings , which will be advertised on posters and leaflets .

the city council said it would spend up to £ 120,000 using thousands of leaflets , plastic bags and parking tickets to ask for people 's views .
it follows the government 's decision that the city 's system of an elected mayor and council manager should end .
the two possible options to replace it are an elected mayor with a cabinet , or a council leader with a cabinet .
the campaign will include an opinion poll and public meetings , which will be advertised on posters and leaflets .
the city council will consider the results in september , but will have to hold a referendum if it wants to abolish the position of elected mayor .
the council says it wants everyone in stoke-on-trent to know about the choice it wants them to make .
the issue will also be raised football match programmes , on bus stops and in the local media .
city council leaders met a government official in december 2006 to discuss a new constitution for stoke .

nine minutes into the pre-recorded interview for radio 4 arts show front row , the 31-year-old asked to leave the studio as he was not enjoying himself .
the band 's drummer , will champion , was left to answer questions from presenter john wilson until martin returned for one final question .
coldplay 's new album , viva la vida , was released on thursday .
' journalistically twisting ' martin appeared uncomfortable with the interview from the outset .
when asked about a speech he made at a music awards ceremony in 2005 where he said the band would be away " for a very long time " , martin said : " i always say stupid things and i think radio 4 is the place that will most remind me of that . "
presenter wilson questioned whether the new album - full title , viva la vida or death and all his friends - was a morbid reflection of the band 's lyrical obsession with death .
" i would n't agree with you there at all , no , " said martin .
" i 'd say you 're journalistically twisting me into saying something i do n't really mean . "
a few minutes later , martin said he was " not really enjoying this " and that he did not really like " having to talk about things " .
champion answered the remaining questions before the frontman returned to answer a final question , about finding new musical territory , with the response : " um . yes ... yes , yes . exactly ... "
sales figures released by the official uk charts company confirm viva la vida sold 125,000 copies in its first day on sale .
it looks certain to be number one in this sunday 's album chart despite only being released towards the end of the week .

the band 's drummer , will champion , was left to answer questions from presenter john wilson until martin returned for one final question .
coldplay 's new album , viva la vida , was released on thursday .
' journalistically twisting ' martin appeared uncomfortable with the interview from the outset .
when asked about a speech he made at a music awards ceremony in 2005 where he said the band would be away " for a very long time " , martin said : " i always say stupid things and i think radio 4 is the place that will most remind me of that . "
the band had french revolution-style uniforms made to promote the album presenter wilson questioned whether the new album - full title , viva la vida or death and all his friends - was a morbid reflection of the band 's lyrical obsession with death .
" i would n't agree with you there at all , no , " said martin .
" i 'd say you 're journalistically twisting me into saying something i do n't really mean . "
a few minutes later , martin said he was " not really enjoying this " and that he did not really like " having to talk about things " .
champion answered the remaining questions before the frontman returned to answer a final question , about finding new musical territory , with the response : " um . yes ... yes , yes . exactly ... "
sales figures released by the official uk charts company confirm viva la vida sold 125,000 copies in its first day on sale .
it looks certain to be number one in this sunday 's album chart despite only being released towards the end of the week .
