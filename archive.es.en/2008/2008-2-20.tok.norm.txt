there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?
" reptiles ensure better grades at school " or " arachnoids are just the thing to spice up your sex life ? "
now it 's hard to argue against women enjoying the company of furry , four-legged friends or men stroking pussycats - after all , patting that cute white cat certainly made the blofeld character from the old james bond films much more likeable .
cynics may claim that that the study in question may have been more about flogging off flea collars and pet food than advancing the cause of scientific inquiry . we , however , would never insinuate such a thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .

" if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned .

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .
that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts .

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .

20 .
possible strikes could have affected key sectors of german industry . germany 's largest union , which includes 2.3 million members , managed to secure a wage increase of 5.2 percent from march for the next 13 months .
in addition , the ig metall union negotiated that employers are to make a one-time payment of 200 euros -lrb- $ 290 -rrb- for the month of february . the deal is a major wage agreement and is seen as providing a framework for upcoming talks for some 8,000 steelworkers in the eastern german steel industry and talks in the western state of saarland later in the year . wednesday 's agreement affects manufacturers in the core steelmaking states of north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bremen , along with related plants in other states . ig metall negotiating chief oliver burkhard was pleased with the outcome , with the wage increase the highest in the sector in 15 years .
the union had entered negotiations with a demand of eight percent . government pleased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers have abstained from striking in the past employers ' negotiator helmut koch acknowledged that the major german steelmakers had compromised for fear of strikes .
warning strikes earlier this month saw 39,000 employees halt work . " a widespread strike would have had devastating consequences for companies and the economy , " koch told dpa news service . federal labor minister olaf scholz welcomed the deal .
speaking to german public broadcasters , however , scholz said the government would not comment on the exact details of the wage agreements . given the two years of solid growth in 2006 and 2007 in germany , workers were likely entitled to substantial rises after years of restraint . ig metall was not able to secure its demand for a shorter working week for older workers , but ig metall chief burkhard said the issue would remain on the table for the future . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?
" reptiles ensure better grades at school " or " arachnoids are just the thing to spice up your sex life ? "
now it 's hard to argue against women enjoying the company of furry , four-legged friends or men stroking pussycats - after all , patting that cute white cat certainly made the blofeld character from the old james bond films much more likeable .
cynics may claim that that the study in question may have been more about flogging off flea collars and pet food than advancing the cause of scientific inquiry . we , however , would never insinuate such a thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de future face of european union plagued by uncertainty often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .

20 .
possible strikes could have affected key sectors of german industry . germany 's largest union , which includes 2.3 million members , managed to secure a wage increase of 5.2 percent from march for the next 13 months .
in addition , the ig metall union negotiated that employers are to make a one-time payment of 200 euros -lrb- $ 290 -rrb- for the month of february . the deal is a major wage agreement and is seen as providing a framework for upcoming talks for some 8,000 steelworkers in the eastern german steel industry and talks in the western state of saarland later in the year . wednesday 's agreement affects manufacturers in the core steelmaking states of north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bremen , along with related plants in other states . ig metall negotiating chief oliver burkhard was pleased with the outcome , with the wage increase the highest in the sector in 15 years .
the union had entered negotiations with a demand of eight percent . government pleased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers have abstained from striking in the past employers ' negotiator helmut koch acknowledged that the major german steelmakers had compromised for fear of strikes .
warning strikes earlier this month saw 39,000 employees halt work . " a widespread strike would have had devastating consequences for companies and the economy , " koch told dpa news service . federal labor minister olaf scholz welcomed the deal .
speaking to german public broadcasters , however , scholz said the government would not comment on the exact details of the wage agreements . given the two years of solid growth in 2006 and 2007 in germany , workers were likely entitled to substantial rises after years of restraint . ig metall was not able to secure its demand for a shorter working week for older workers , but ig metall chief burkhard said the issue would remain on the table for the future . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , that sending an eu mission to kovoso would be a breach of international law , and called the plan symbolic of the west 's double standard in recognizing kosovo 's independence from serbia . the european union has already agreed to send a mission to kosovo , consisting of some 2,000 police officers , justice and customs officials to aid and train authorities there and help stabilize the region following kosovo 's declaration of independence . russia on wednesday said kosovo 's proclamation of independence was a " gross violation " of international law and said the eu mission had no legal basis since the decision was made without approval from the u.n. security council . " the european union , unilaterally , and without any sanction from the un security council , is sending a mission to kosovo to ensure the supremacy of the law , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov told reporters at a news briefing with turkish foreign minister ali babacan . " to put it mildly , it is a bitter irony that this mission to ensure the supremacy of the law in kosovo is being sent in breach of the highest international law , " he continued . fear separatist tension will spread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov lavrov also repeated at the news conference russia 's prior argument that existing security council resolutions say that kosovo is part of serbia . russian president vladimir putin had already said last week that the west was guilty of double standards in pushing for kosovo 's independence , a charge lavrov reiterated . furthermore , russian said the west 's recognition of independence would stir up strife in the balkans and would open up a " pandora 's box " of separatist tension across europe . even the leader of the russian orthodox church said kosovo 's independence bring about disorder . " it is an ... event which has unilaterally upset the balance in the world and could lead to very tragic events in a whole host of areas across the globe where separatist sentiments are warming up , " patriarch alexiy ii said . " former brutality negates moral rights " russia is a close serbian ally , and as a permanent member of the united nations security council , opposed kosovo from making its split from belgrade . kosovo delared its independence on sunday , with the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany , having recognized the state .
serbia has since recalled its ambassador from berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians in europe even celebrated sunday 's declaration of independence the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutality under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . the eu is expected to deploy its mission by june .
authorities are to help oversee institution-building , and would have limited rights to help fight organized crime and corruption or track down war criminals . kosovo has been a un protectorate since 1999 when nato carried out bombing raids to end a conflict between serbian security forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

20 .
possible strikes could have affected key sectors of german industry . germany 's largest union , which includes 2.3 million members , managed to secure a wage increase of 5.2 percent from march for the next 13 months .
in addition , the ig metall union negotiated that employers are to make a one-time payment of 200 euros -lrb- $ 290 -rrb- for the month of february . the deal is a major wage agreement and is seen as providing a framework for upcoming talks for some 8,000 steelworkers in the eastern german steel industry and talks in the western state of saarland later in the year . wednesday 's agreement affects manufacturers in the core steelmaking states of north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bremen , along with related plants in other states . ig metall negotiating chief oliver burkhard was pleased with the outcome , with the wage increase the highest in the sector in 15 years .
the union had entered negotiations with a demand of eight percent . government pleased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers have abstained from striking in the past employers ' negotiator helmut koch acknowledged that the major german steelmakers had compromised for fear of strikes .
warning strikes earlier this month saw 39,000 employees halt work . " a widespread strike would have had devastating consequences for companies and the economy , " koch told dpa news service . federal labor minister olaf scholz welcomed the deal .
speaking to german public broadcasters , however , scholz said the government would not comment on the exact details of the wage agreements . given the two years of solid growth in 2006 and 2007 in germany , workers were likely entitled to substantial rises after years of restraint . ig metall was not able to secure its demand for a shorter working week for older workers , but ig metall chief burkhard said the issue would remain on the table for the future . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?
" reptiles ensure better grades at school " or " arachnoids are just the thing to spice up your sex life ? "
now it 's hard to argue against women enjoying the company of furry , four-legged friends or men stroking pussycats - after all , patting that cute white cat certainly made the blofeld character from the old james bond films much more likeable .
cynics may claim that that the study in question may have been more about flogging off flea collars and pet food than advancing the cause of scientific inquiry . we , however , would never insinuate such a thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the last thing that the cubans need in the difficult transition period ahead is advice from outside , from neo-liberal redeemers and democratic smart alecks , " wrote switzerland 's tagesanzeiger .
" above all , the united states should show restraint , particularly because its relationship with the island 150 kilometers off miami is on the verge of being neurotic . " " the country can only seize the chance to start afresh if its almighty neighbor gives it that opportunity , " the zurich-based paper added . germany 's frankfurter rundschau concluded that the outlook for cuba was not optimistic because of the failure of castro 's cuba .
" many people will leave , particularly the younger generation , and external pressure to impose a system based on a western blueprint will not let up , " wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romantic or just plain ramshackle ?
" there are not many reasons to mourn the passing of fidel castro 's cuba .
but there is just as little ground to have unbounded enthusiasm about the foreseeable alternatives . " paris ' le figaro commented that it was time for the west to call for cuba to be truly liberalized .
" now is the time to be constructive and optimistic , " the newspaper wrote . " change has begun in cuba and europe is prepared to help those political leaders on the island who want a peaceful transition , who want to release political prisoners and aim to organize elections in the future , so that cubans can finally decide their own fate , " it continued . denmark 's jyllands posten blamed tourism for helping castro to survive the collapse of the soviet union and remain in power for so long .

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .
that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .
in terms of the efficiency of its tax system , germany was ranked 102nd in a survey of 102 states carried out by the world economic forum as part of its global effectiveness report . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , with liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler in berlin , said the meeting was " constructive " and stressed that she not given the principality any ultimatums , but said she expected action . " time is of the essence , " merkel said .
" the faster action is taken , the better the basis for good relations . " however , the chancellor criticized liechtenstein 's banking secrecy and said she expected an agreement giving berlin insight into german investments in the alpine tax haven . " what is possible with the united states should be possible with the european union , " merkel told reporters . the chancellor was refering to an accord which binds liechtenstein banks to divulge information to the us 's tax authority - the internal revenue service -lrb- irs -rrb- - about investments made by us citizens in the principality . need for greater transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and liechtenstein 's prime minister hasler that demand was just one of many made amid an ever-widening tax fraud scandal involving some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- members of germany 's elite have reportedly hidden in secret accounts in liechtenstein . hasler , who is also his country 's finance minister , acknowledged the principality 's willingness to work with germany : " we have good relations with one another and are interested in keeping it that way , " he said . he also pointed to certain reforms that were underway regarding liechtenstein 's law on foundations , which have in the past been used by wealthy germans to conceal untaxed income from german inland revenue . " liechtenstein is on a road to reform that was initiated independently of events of recent days , " hasler said . still , germany continues to demand that liechtenstein comply with the rules of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- regarding unfair tax competition and financial transparency . " it is also important that liechteinstein apply the third european directive on money-laundering in order to allow for a calculation of someone 's real fortune and thus improve the transparency needed to fight money- laundering , " merkel 's spokesman told reporters .
germany itself has yet to ratify those guidelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and liechtenstein want good relations , but money is a sticky matter this week , the paris-based oecd sharply criticized the " excessive " secrecy of banks in leichtenstein , which shares a spot with monaco and andorra on its blacklist of uncooperative tax havens . possible leverage for more cooperation meanwhile , a european union diplomat told an afp new agency reporter that germany may threaten to delay liechtenstein 's admission to the schengen zone of passport-free travel due to the tax fraud dispute .
there is , however , no confirmation of such a threat . " certain member states could have an interest in putting pressure on liechtenstein " and " slow down the ratification of the -lrb- schengen -rrb- treaty , " the diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity . interior ministers from the eu 's 27-member bloc are scheduled to sign an agreement on february 28 on liechtenstein joining the zone , but it would have to ratified by all members . liechtenstein critical of german approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny alpine principality is considered a tax haven the tax evasion scandal broke last thursday , when police raided the home and office of deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel , one of germany 's most respected business leaders .
zumwinkel is accused of having stashed millions of euros in liechtenstein to escape taxes in germany . the raids since have widened across the country , and are expected to continue for weeks .
not only the country 's business elite , but also wealthy sports and entertainment stars are believed to have deposited billions of euros in liechtenstein . the principality , situated between austria and switzerland , has been critical of germany 's investigation , particularly regarding the way german authorities paid millions of euros for data about the alleged tax fraud .
the informant , who provided a cd containing information on foundations managed by liechtenstein bank ltg , is viewed as a thief in liechtenstein . " in liechtenstein , spying on business secrets and passing on the information is punishable by law .
and this will be prosecuted in liechtenstein , " prime minister hasler said earlier . in the european edition of the financial times , hasler noted that his country 's banking system had twice been inspected and approved by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " liechtenstein accordingly has a system for combating money laundering , organized crime and financing of terrorism that has been recognized by international experts and that complies with existing international standards to a high degree , " he said . discovering german tax evaders was a matter for german officials and not for liechtenstein , hasler said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .
that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy .

it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy .

that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned .

people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?
" reptiles ensure better grades at school " or " arachnoids are just the thing to spice up your sex life ? "
now it 's hard to argue against women enjoying the company of furry , four-legged friends or men stroking pussycats - after all , patting that cute white cat certainly made the blofeld character from the old james bond films much more likeable .
cynics may claim that that the study in question may have been more about flogging off flea collars and pet food than advancing the cause of scientific inquiry . we , however , would never insinuate such a thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .

" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 20.02.2008 european parliament ratifies lisbon treaty despite protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two months after the historic meeting in lisbon , meps ratified the reform treaty the european parliament on wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of the lisbon treaty , which reforms the european union 's institutions .
there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de future face of european union plagued by uncertainty often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .

" the european union , unilaterally , and without any sanction from the un security council , is sending a mission to kosovo to ensure the supremacy of the law , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov told reporters at a news briefing with turkish foreign minister ali babacan .

" former brutality negates moral rights " russia is a close serbian ally , and as a permanent member of the united nations security council , opposed kosovo from making its split from belgrade . kosovo delared its independence on sunday , with the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany , having recognized the state .
serbia has since recalled its ambassador from berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians in europe even celebrated sunday 's declaration of independence the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutality under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . the eu is expected to deploy its mission by june .
authorities are to help oversee institution-building , and would have limited rights to help fight organized crime and corruption or track down war criminals . kosovo has been a un protectorate since 1999 when nato carried out bombing raids to end a conflict between serbian security forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

possible strikes could have affected key sectors of german industry . germany 's largest union , which includes 2.3 million members , managed to secure a wage increase of 5.2 percent from march for the next 13 months .
in addition , the ig metall union negotiated that employers are to make a one-time payment of 200 euros -lrb- $ 290 -rrb- for the month of february . the deal is a major wage agreement and is seen as providing a framework for upcoming talks for some 8,000 steelworkers in the eastern german steel industry and talks in the western state of saarland later in the year . wednesday 's agreement affects manufacturers in the core steelmaking states of north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bremen , along with related plants in other states . ig metall negotiating chief oliver burkhard was pleased with the outcome , with the wage increase the highest in the sector in 15 years .
the union had entered negotiations with a demand of eight percent . government pleased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers have abstained from striking in the past employers ' negotiator helmut koch acknowledged that the major german steelmakers had compromised for fear of strikes .
warning strikes earlier this month saw 39,000 employees halt work . " a widespread strike would have had devastating consequences for companies and the economy , " koch told dpa news service . federal labor minister olaf scholz welcomed the deal .
speaking to german public broadcasters , however , scholz said the government would not comment on the exact details of the wage agreements . given the two years of solid growth in 2006 and 2007 in germany , workers were likely entitled to substantial rises after years of restraint . ig metall was not able to secure its demand for a shorter working week for older workers , but ig metall chief burkhard said the issue would remain on the table for the future . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy .

that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .
that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .
in terms of the efficiency of its tax system , germany was ranked 102nd in a survey of 102 states carried out by the world economic forum as part of its global effectiveness report . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.02.2008 who 's to blame for germany 's massive tax evasion scandal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tiny alpine state has more than scenic attraction for germany 's well-heeled chancellor merkel is to press liechtenstein 's leader about his nation 's role as a tax haven for hundreds of rich germans in one of the biggest scandals to hit the eu power .
but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .
that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned .

" the last thing that the cubans need in the difficult transition period ahead is advice from outside , from neo-liberal redeemers and democratic smart alecks , " wrote switzerland 's tagesanzeiger .
" above all , the united states should show restraint , particularly because its relationship with the island 150 kilometers off miami is on the verge of being neurotic . " " the country can only seize the chance to start afresh if its almighty neighbor gives it that opportunity , " the zurich-based paper added . germany 's frankfurter rundschau concluded that the outlook for cuba was not optimistic because of the failure of castro 's cuba .

" now is the time to be constructive and optimistic , " the newspaper wrote . " change has begun in cuba and europe is prepared to help those political leaders on the island who want a peaceful transition , who want to release political prisoners and aim to organize elections in the future , so that cubans can finally decide their own fate , " it continued . denmark 's jyllands posten blamed tourism for helping castro to survive the collapse of the soviet union and remain in power for so long .

but the game also revealed some weaknesses in schalke 's squad . the german side entered uncharted waters on tuesday , feb.19 , playing for the first time ever in the knock-out stage of the champions league .
and despite some uneasy passages , they sailed through with a 1-0 win over former title holders porto . the 54,000 fans in the sold-out schalke arena were visibly and audibly excited about the match , and the level of support seemed to intimidate the visitors , who fell behind after only four minutes . porto 's brazilian keeper helton could only parry a crisply taken shot by schalke defender rafinha into the middle , and striker kevin kuranyi was on hand to swipe the ball into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah was ineffective for schalke schalke had the better of the first but failed to convert any of their chances and extend their lead . the hosts came out flat after the break - with porto having more and more of the ball as the second half progressed .
in particular , schalke had trouble linking the midfield and the attack , a recurring problem this season . their young keeper manuel neuer also had a couple of wobbly moments that might have proved costly against a more offensively proficient foe . but porto forward lisandro lopez squandered the visitors ' best chance for an equalizer , somehow deflecting a cross in the 80th minute away from a tantalizingly open goal . schalke held on for a tight - and historic - win and are now in the driver 's seat for the return match in porto on march 5 . liverpool recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inter were left hanging their heads at anfield in the night 's other action , liverpool rebounded from their disastrous results in the fa cup and the premiership , to book a 2-0 home win over serie a leaders inter milan . marco materazzi - the world 's most famous head-butt recipient - did the hosts a favor by getting sent off in the 30th minute . but it took 55 minutes before striker dirk kuyt could exploit the man advantage and put liverpool in front .
steven gerrard added a second goal just before time to complete scoring at anfield . meanwhile , chelsea were playing out a goalless draw away to greek side olympiakos , in a match that saw germany captain michael ballack return to champions league action . as rome came from behind to beat spanish league leader real madrid 2-1 .

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .

authorities are to help oversee institution-building , and would have limited rights to help fight organized crime and corruption or track down war criminals . kosovo has been a un protectorate since 1999 when nato carried out bombing raids to end a conflict between serbian security forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

20 , with liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler in berlin , said the meeting was " constructive " and stressed that she not given the principality any ultimatums , but said she expected action . " time is of the essence , " merkel said .
" the faster action is taken , the better the basis for good relations . " however , the chancellor criticized liechtenstein 's banking secrecy and said she expected an agreement giving berlin insight into german investments in the alpine tax haven . " what is possible with the united states should be possible with the european union , " merkel told reporters . the chancellor was refering to an accord which binds liechtenstein banks to divulge information to the us 's tax authority - the internal revenue service -lrb- irs -rrb- - about investments made by us citizens in the principality . need for greater transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and liechtenstein 's prime minister hasler that demand was just one of many made amid an ever-widening tax fraud scandal involving some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- members of germany 's elite have reportedly hidden in secret accounts in liechtenstein . hasler , who is also his country 's finance minister , acknowledged the principality 's willingness to work with germany : " we have good relations with one another and are interested in keeping it that way , " he said . he also pointed to certain reforms that were underway regarding liechtenstein 's law on foundations , which have in the past been used by wealthy germans to conceal untaxed income from german inland revenue . " liechtenstein is on a road to reform that was initiated independently of events of recent days , " hasler said . still , germany continues to demand that liechtenstein comply with the rules of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- regarding unfair tax competition and financial transparency . " it is also important that liechteinstein apply the third european directive on money-laundering in order to allow for a calculation of someone 's real fortune and thus improve the transparency needed to fight money- laundering , " merkel 's spokesman told reporters .
germany itself has yet to ratify those guidelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and liechtenstein want good relations , but money is a sticky matter this week , the paris-based oecd sharply criticized the " excessive " secrecy of banks in leichtenstein , which shares a spot with monaco and andorra on its blacklist of uncooperative tax havens . possible leverage for more cooperation meanwhile , a european union diplomat told an afp new agency reporter that germany may threaten to delay liechtenstein 's admission to the schengen zone of passport-free travel due to the tax fraud dispute .
there is , however , no confirmation of such a threat .

20 , with liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler in berlin , said the meeting was " constructive " and stressed that she not given the principality any ultimatums , but said she expected action . " time is of the essence , " merkel said .
" the faster action is taken , the better the basis for good relations . " however , the chancellor criticized liechtenstein 's banking secrecy and said she expected an agreement giving berlin insight into german investments in the alpine tax haven . " what is possible with the united states should be possible with the european union , " merkel told reporters . the chancellor was refering to an accord which binds liechtenstein banks to divulge information to the us 's tax authority - the internal revenue service -lrb- irs -rrb- - about investments made by us citizens in the principality . need for greater transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and liechtenstein 's prime minister hasler that demand was just one of many made amid an ever-widening tax fraud scandal involving some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- members of germany 's elite have reportedly hidden in secret accounts in liechtenstein . hasler , who is also his country 's finance minister , acknowledged the principality 's willingness to work with germany : " we have good relations with one another and are interested in keeping it that way , " he said . he also pointed to certain reforms that were underway regarding liechtenstein 's law on foundations , which have in the past been used by wealthy germans to conceal untaxed income from german inland revenue . " liechtenstein is on a road to reform that was initiated independently of events of recent days , " hasler said . still , germany continues to demand that liechtenstein comply with the rules of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- regarding unfair tax competition and financial transparency . " it is also important that liechteinstein apply the third european directive on money-laundering in order to allow for a calculation of someone 's real fortune and thus improve the transparency needed to fight money- laundering , " merkel 's spokesman told reporters .
germany itself has yet to ratify those guidelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and liechtenstein want good relations , but money is a sticky matter this week , the paris-based oecd sharply criticized the " excessive " secrecy of banks in leichtenstein , which shares a spot with monaco and andorra on its blacklist of uncooperative tax havens . possible leverage for more cooperation meanwhile , a european union diplomat told an afp new agency reporter that germany may threaten to delay liechtenstein 's admission to the schengen zone of passport-free travel due to the tax fraud dispute .
there is , however , no confirmation of such a threat . " certain member states could have an interest in putting pressure on liechtenstein " and " slow down the ratification of the -lrb- schengen -rrb- treaty , " the diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity . interior ministers from the eu 's 27-member bloc are scheduled to sign an agreement on february 28 on liechtenstein joining the zone , but it would have to ratified by all members . liechtenstein critical of german approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny alpine principality is considered a tax haven the tax evasion scandal broke last thursday , when police raided the home and office of deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel , one of germany 's most respected business leaders .

but the game also revealed some weaknesses in schalke 's squad . the german side entered uncharted waters on tuesday , feb.19 , playing for the first time ever in the knock-out stage of the champions league .
and despite some uneasy passages , they sailed through with a 1-0 win over former title holders porto . the 54,000 fans in the sold-out schalke arena were visibly and audibly excited about the match , and the level of support seemed to intimidate the visitors , who fell behind after only four minutes . porto 's brazilian keeper helton could only parry a crisply taken shot by schalke defender rafinha into the middle , and striker kevin kuranyi was on hand to swipe the ball into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah was ineffective for schalke schalke had the better of the first but failed to convert any of their chances and extend their lead . the hosts came out flat after the break - with porto having more and more of the ball as the second half progressed .
in particular , schalke had trouble linking the midfield and the attack , a recurring problem this season . their young keeper manuel neuer also had a couple of wobbly moments that might have proved costly against a more offensively proficient foe . but porto forward lisandro lopez squandered the visitors ' best chance for an equalizer , somehow deflecting a cross in the 80th minute away from a tantalizingly open goal . schalke held on for a tight - and historic - win and are now in the driver 's seat for the return match in porto on march 5 . liverpool recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inter were left hanging their heads at anfield in the night 's other action , liverpool rebounded from their disastrous results in the fa cup and the premiership , to book a 2-0 home win over serie a leaders inter milan . marco materazzi - the world 's most famous head-butt recipient - did the hosts a favor by getting sent off in the 30th minute . but it took 55 minutes before striker dirk kuyt could exploit the man advantage and put liverpool in front .
steven gerrard added a second goal just before time to complete scoring at anfield . meanwhile , chelsea were playing out a goalless draw away to greek side olympiakos , in a match that saw germany captain michael ballack return to champions league action . as rome came from behind to beat spanish league leader real madrid 2-1 .

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?

but the game also revealed some weaknesses in schalke 's squad . the german side entered uncharted waters on tuesday , feb.19 , playing for the first time ever in the knock-out stage of the champions league .
and despite some uneasy passages , they sailed through with a 1-0 win over former title holders porto . the 54,000 fans in the sold-out schalke arena were visibly and audibly excited about the match , and the level of support seemed to intimidate the visitors , who fell behind after only four minutes . porto 's brazilian keeper helton could only parry a crisply taken shot by schalke defender rafinha into the middle , and striker kevin kuranyi was on hand to swipe the ball into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah was ineffective for schalke schalke had the better of the first but failed to convert any of their chances and extend their lead . the hosts came out flat after the break - with porto having more and more of the ball as the second half progressed .
in particular , schalke had trouble linking the midfield and the attack , a recurring problem this season . their young keeper manuel neuer also had a couple of wobbly moments that might have proved costly against a more offensively proficient foe . but porto forward lisandro lopez squandered the visitors ' best chance for an equalizer , somehow deflecting a cross in the 80th minute away from a tantalizingly open goal . schalke held on for a tight - and historic - win and are now in the driver 's seat for the return match in porto on march 5 . liverpool recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inter were left hanging their heads at anfield in the night 's other action , liverpool rebounded from their disastrous results in the fa cup and the premiership , to book a 2-0 home win over serie a leaders inter milan . marco materazzi - the world 's most famous head-butt recipient - did the hosts a favor by getting sent off in the 30th minute . but it took 55 minutes before striker dirk kuyt could exploit the man advantage and put liverpool in front .
steven gerrard added a second goal just before time to complete scoring at anfield . meanwhile , chelsea were playing out a goalless draw away to greek side olympiakos , in a match that saw germany captain michael ballack return to champions league action . as rome came from behind to beat spanish league leader real madrid 2-1 .

" the last thing that the cubans need in the difficult transition period ahead is advice from outside , from neo-liberal redeemers and democratic smart alecks , " wrote switzerland 's tagesanzeiger .
" above all , the united states should show restraint , particularly because its relationship with the island 150 kilometers off miami is on the verge of being neurotic . " " the country can only seize the chance to start afresh if its almighty neighbor gives it that opportunity , " the zurich-based paper added . germany 's frankfurter rundschau concluded that the outlook for cuba was not optimistic because of the failure of castro 's cuba .
" many people will leave , particularly the younger generation , and external pressure to impose a system based on a western blueprint will not let up , " wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romantic or just plain ramshackle ?
" there are not many reasons to mourn the passing of fidel castro 's cuba .
but there is just as little ground to have unbounded enthusiasm about the foreseeable alternatives . " paris ' le figaro commented that it was time for the west to call for cuba to be truly liberalized .
" now is the time to be constructive and optimistic , " the newspaper wrote . " change has begun in cuba and europe is prepared to help those political leaders on the island who want a peaceful transition , who want to release political prisoners and aim to organize elections in the future , so that cubans can finally decide their own fate , " it continued . denmark 's jyllands posten blamed tourism for helping castro to survive the collapse of the soviet union and remain in power for so long .

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .
that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .
in terms of the efficiency of its tax system , germany was ranked 102nd in a survey of 102 states carried out by the world economic forum as part of its global effectiveness report . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .

20 .
possible strikes could have affected key sectors of german industry . germany 's largest union , which includes 2.3 million members , managed to secure a wage increase of 5.2 percent from march for the next 13 months .
in addition , the ig metall union negotiated that employers are to make a one-time payment of 200 euros -lrb- $ 290 -rrb- for the month of february . the deal is a major wage agreement and is seen as providing a framework for upcoming talks for some 8,000 steelworkers in the eastern german steel industry and talks in the western state of saarland later in the year . wednesday 's agreement affects manufacturers in the core steelmaking states of north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bremen , along with related plants in other states . ig metall negotiating chief oliver burkhard was pleased with the outcome , with the wage increase the highest in the sector in 15 years .
the union had entered negotiations with a demand of eight percent . government pleased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers have abstained from striking in the past employers ' negotiator helmut koch acknowledged that the major german steelmakers had compromised for fear of strikes .
warning strikes earlier this month saw 39,000 employees halt work . " a widespread strike would have had devastating consequences for companies and the economy , " koch told dpa news service . federal labor minister olaf scholz welcomed the deal .
speaking to german public broadcasters , however , scholz said the government would not comment on the exact details of the wage agreements . given the two years of solid growth in 2006 and 2007 in germany , workers were likely entitled to substantial rises after years of restraint . ig metall was not able to secure its demand for a shorter working week for older workers , but ig metall chief burkhard said the issue would remain on the table for the future . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .
that is why all countries should sign up to the agreement on information sharing .
it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .

20 , with liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler in berlin , said the meeting was " constructive " and stressed that she not given the principality any ultimatums , but said she expected action . " time is of the essence , " merkel said .
" the faster action is taken , the better the basis for good relations . " however , the chancellor criticized liechtenstein 's banking secrecy and said she expected an agreement giving berlin insight into german investments in the alpine tax haven . " what is possible with the united states should be possible with the european union , " merkel told reporters . the chancellor was refering to an accord which binds liechtenstein banks to divulge information to the us 's tax authority - the internal revenue service -lrb- irs -rrb- - about investments made by us citizens in the principality . need for greater transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and liechtenstein 's prime minister hasler that demand was just one of many made amid an ever-widening tax fraud scandal involving some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- members of germany 's elite have reportedly hidden in secret accounts in liechtenstein . hasler , who is also his country 's finance minister , acknowledged the principality 's willingness to work with germany : " we have good relations with one another and are interested in keeping it that way , " he said . he also pointed to certain reforms that were underway regarding liechtenstein 's law on foundations , which have in the past been used by wealthy germans to conceal untaxed income from german inland revenue .

zumwinkel is accused of having stashed millions of euros in liechtenstein to escape taxes in germany . the raids since have widened across the country , and are expected to continue for weeks .
not only the country 's business elite , but also wealthy sports and entertainment stars are believed to have deposited billions of euros in liechtenstein . the principality , situated between austria and switzerland , has been critical of germany 's investigation , particularly regarding the way german authorities paid millions of euros for data about the alleged tax fraud .
the informant , who provided a cd containing information on foundations managed by liechtenstein bank ltg , is viewed as a thief in liechtenstein . " in liechtenstein , spying on business secrets and passing on the information is punishable by law .
and this will be prosecuted in liechtenstein , " prime minister hasler said earlier . in the european edition of the financial times , hasler noted that his country 's banking system had twice been inspected and approved by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " liechtenstein accordingly has a system for combating money laundering , organized crime and financing of terrorism that has been recognized by international experts and that complies with existing international standards to a high degree , " he said . discovering german tax evaders was a matter for german officials and not for liechtenstein , hasler said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?
" reptiles ensure better grades at school " or " arachnoids are just the thing to spice up your sex life ? "
now it 's hard to argue against women enjoying the company of furry , four-legged friends or men stroking pussycats - after all , patting that cute white cat certainly made the blofeld character from the old james bond films much more likeable .
cynics may claim that that the study in question may have been more about flogging off flea collars and pet food than advancing the cause of scientific inquiry . we , however , would never insinuate such a thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.02.2008 who 's to blame for germany 's massive tax evasion scandal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tiny alpine state has more than scenic attraction for germany 's well-heeled chancellor merkel is to press liechtenstein 's leader about his nation 's role as a tax haven for hundreds of rich germans in one of the biggest scandals to hit the eu power .
but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .
with a mouse click , you can move millions or billions of dollars around the world .

it 's a question of maintaining the integrity of the tax system , " owens said . dieter ondracek , whose organization represents staff working in germany 's financial administration , has also appealed to liechtenstein to work closely with german investigators and close loopholes . but while the german tax union 's chairman described the non-eu member as a " disruptive factor " in the european union , he also blamed the shortage of tax investigators and the lack of transparency in the german system itself for the problem . " if people are presented with the opportunity , they will be tempted .
it is not a problem that is restricted to the elite , but affects german society as a whole , " according to ondracek . the president of the german taxpayers ' association karl-heinz daeke and former constitutional court judge and tax expert paul kirchhof have both called for german 's byzantine tax system to be simplified . " the system has to be radically changed , so that is no longer so complex that people can not understand it and the financial authorities can not monitor it , " said daeke . he also attacked taxation levels in germany for contributing to the problem . " the burden of taxation is much too high for the rank and file as well , " daeke said .
" it tempts people into criminal acts . " but like ondracek , daeke also stressed that people should be aware that they are harming the common good if they do not pay their dues . could a simplification of tax laws help ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's complex laws encouraging criminality ?
the current scandal could see a renaissance of kirchhof 's radical and controversial reform plans to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent and abolish germany 's seven different taxation categories based on the type of income earned . " the idea that everyone is treated equitably has been violated .
people 's economic performance is no longer the decisive issue , but rather their ability to outsmart the tax office , " said kirchhof , now a law professor at heidelberg university . there is certainly room for improvement .

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?
" reptiles ensure better grades at school " or " arachnoids are just the thing to spice up your sex life ? "
now it 's hard to argue against women enjoying the company of furry , four-legged friends or men stroking pussycats - after all , patting that cute white cat certainly made the blofeld character from the old james bond films much more likeable .
cynics may claim that that the study in question may have been more about flogging off flea collars and pet food than advancing the cause of scientific inquiry . we , however , would never insinuate such a thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the tiny principality alone at fault ? as tax investigators continue to raid the homes and offices of hundreds of high-flying wealthy germans alleged to have hidden money in liechtenstein to dodge their own country 's high personal income taxes , outrage is mounting in germany . some believe that the tax haven , which has built its reputation on bank secrecy , is simply thumbing its nose at its european neighbors .
others regard the problem as at least partly home-grown . that a problem exists is indisputable .
tax evasion is estimated to cost the german state around 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 44 billion -rrb- a year , said dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union .
between 6 billion and 8 billion euros of this money is believed to end up in liechtenstein . liechtenstein 's secretive bank practices under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein global trust is at the center of the tax scandal unfolding in germany the alpine principality liechtenstein , along with monaco and andorra , is one of only three states still blacklisted by the organization for economic co-operation and development because of their failure to endorse regulations designed to end harmful tax practices . jeffrey owens , director for tax policy and administration at the osce , particularly criticized the lack of transparency in the management of certain financial instruments , such as foundations .
state prosecutors in bochum allege that deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel , who resigned last week , evaded paying tax on some 1 million euros via just such a foundation - set up by a trustee in the liechtenstein bank lgt group and operated anonymously . the problem of tax havens is an international one that is growing thanks to increasingly borderless financial markets and the sophistication of modern telecommunications , according to owens .
ireland , for example , recently recovered around a billion euros after an investigation into accounts held in offshore banks . " this is not a unique german problem , " owens said .
" the problem is very much at the liechtenstein end .
it is important that countries should compete on the basis of the service that they provide rather than on the basis of secrecy . " financial mobility has made problem acute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former deutsche post boss klaus zumwinkel is the most high-profile tax cheat uncovered so far " we need to address the downside of globalization .

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .

20 , that sending an eu mission to kovoso would be a breach of international law , and called the plan symbolic of the west 's double standard in recognizing kosovo 's independence from serbia . the european union has already agreed to send a mission to kosovo , consisting of some 2,000 police officers , justice and customs officials to aid and train authorities there and help stabilize the region following kosovo 's declaration of independence . russia on wednesday said kosovo 's proclamation of independence was a " gross violation " of international law and said the eu mission had no legal basis since the decision was made without approval from the u.n. security council . " the european union , unilaterally , and without any sanction from the un security council , is sending a mission to kosovo to ensure the supremacy of the law , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov told reporters at a news briefing with turkish foreign minister ali babacan . " to put it mildly , it is a bitter irony that this mission to ensure the supremacy of the law in kosovo is being sent in breach of the highest international law , " he continued . fear separatist tension will spread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov lavrov also repeated at the news conference russia 's prior argument that existing security council resolutions say that kosovo is part of serbia . russian president vladimir putin had already said last week that the west was guilty of double standards in pushing for kosovo 's independence , a charge lavrov reiterated . furthermore , russian said the west 's recognition of independence would stir up strife in the balkans and would open up a " pandora 's box " of separatist tension across europe . even the leader of the russian orthodox church said kosovo 's independence bring about disorder . " it is an ... event which has unilaterally upset the balance in the world and could lead to very tragic events in a whole host of areas across the globe where separatist sentiments are warming up , " patriarch alexiy ii said . " former brutality negates moral rights " russia is a close serbian ally , and as a permanent member of the united nations security council , opposed kosovo from making its split from belgrade . kosovo delared its independence on sunday , with the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany , having recognized the state .
serbia has since recalled its ambassador from berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians in europe even celebrated sunday 's declaration of independence the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutality under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . the eu is expected to deploy its mission by june .
authorities are to help oversee institution-building , and would have limited rights to help fight organized crime and corruption or track down war criminals . kosovo has been a un protectorate since 1999 when nato carried out bombing raids to end a conflict between serbian security forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .

it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .

" the last thing that the cubans need in the difficult transition period ahead is advice from outside , from neo-liberal redeemers and democratic smart alecks , " wrote switzerland 's tagesanzeiger .
" above all , the united states should show restraint , particularly because its relationship with the island 150 kilometers off miami is on the verge of being neurotic . " " the country can only seize the chance to start afresh if its almighty neighbor gives it that opportunity , " the zurich-based paper added . germany 's frankfurter rundschau concluded that the outlook for cuba was not optimistic because of the failure of castro 's cuba .
" many people will leave , particularly the younger generation , and external pressure to impose a system based on a western blueprint will not let up , " wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romantic or just plain ramshackle ?
" there are not many reasons to mourn the passing of fidel castro 's cuba .
but there is just as little ground to have unbounded enthusiasm about the foreseeable alternatives . " paris ' le figaro commented that it was time for the west to call for cuba to be truly liberalized .
" now is the time to be constructive and optimistic , " the newspaper wrote . " change has begun in cuba and europe is prepared to help those political leaders on the island who want a peaceful transition , who want to release political prisoners and aim to organize elections in the future , so that cubans can finally decide their own fate , " it continued . denmark 's jyllands posten blamed tourism for helping castro to survive the collapse of the soviet union and remain in power for so long .
" unfortunately it is still too early to hope for rapid reforms in terms of fundamental civil rights such as free speech , the right to assemble as well as real democracy , " the daily added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de future face of european union plagued by uncertainty often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .

there are no easy answers .

20 , that sending an eu mission to kovoso would be a breach of international law , and called the plan symbolic of the west 's double standard in recognizing kosovo 's independence from serbia . the european union has already agreed to send a mission to kosovo , consisting of some 2,000 police officers , justice and customs officials to aid and train authorities there and help stabilize the region following kosovo 's declaration of independence . russia on wednesday said kosovo 's proclamation of independence was a " gross violation " of international law and said the eu mission had no legal basis since the decision was made without approval from the u.n. security council . " the european union , unilaterally , and without any sanction from the un security council , is sending a mission to kosovo to ensure the supremacy of the law , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov told reporters at a news briefing with turkish foreign minister ali babacan . " to put it mildly , it is a bitter irony that this mission to ensure the supremacy of the law in kosovo is being sent in breach of the highest international law , " he continued . fear separatist tension will spread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov lavrov also repeated at the news conference russia 's prior argument that existing security council resolutions say that kosovo is part of serbia . russian president vladimir putin had already said last week that the west was guilty of double standards in pushing for kosovo 's independence , a charge lavrov reiterated . furthermore , russian said the west 's recognition of independence would stir up strife in the balkans and would open up a " pandora 's box " of separatist tension across europe . even the leader of the russian orthodox church said kosovo 's independence bring about disorder . " it is an ... event which has unilaterally upset the balance in the world and could lead to very tragic events in a whole host of areas across the globe where separatist sentiments are warming up , " patriarch alexiy ii said . " former brutality negates moral rights " russia is a close serbian ally , and as a permanent member of the united nations security council , opposed kosovo from making its split from belgrade . kosovo delared its independence on sunday , with the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany , having recognized the state .
serbia has since recalled its ambassador from berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians in europe even celebrated sunday 's declaration of independence the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutality under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . the eu is expected to deploy its mission by june .
authorities are to help oversee institution-building , and would have limited rights to help fight organized crime and corruption or track down war criminals . kosovo has been a un protectorate since 1999 when nato carried out bombing raids to end a conflict between serbian security forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
technically , however , it remained part of serbia . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

man 's best friend - so the saying goes , but now a german study tells women that dogs make them more attractive to both sexes .
the research was publicized by , um , a pet suppliers ' organization . what would the world be without studies ?
somewhere out there in this vast universe of ours , someone is probably hard at work trying to establish a link between the sub-quantum behavior of quarks and britney spears ' mental ups-and-downs .
researchers in bonn and freiburg , meanwhile , are trying to connect female attractiveness and dogs .
an initially counter-intuitive proposition , one might jest , but wait .
420 representative men and women - representative of what , one asks , other than people with too much time on their hands ? - were shown pictures of women with and without dogs and asked which group they found more attractive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study probably did n't include this member of the species and do you know what ?
the women with dogs had more appeal .
" the overwhelming majority of the respondents attributed more self-discipline and patience , as well as greater family sensibility and optimism toward life , to the women with dogs , " said professor reinhold bergler from the institute of psychology at the university of bonn .
fascinating , one might say in one 's best leonard nimoy voice - until one notices that the organization responsible for bringing this discovery to the media 's attention was the industrial association of pet suppliers .
said organization also promotes research showing that men with cats are considered more sensitive , and relationships in which the partners do n't like each others ' pets tend not to last .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes humans and animals can get too close what 's next ?
" reptiles ensure better grades at school " or " arachnoids are just the thing to spice up your sex life ? "
now it 's hard to argue against women enjoying the company of furry , four-legged friends or men stroking pussycats - after all , patting that cute white cat certainly made the blofeld character from the old james bond films much more likeable .
cynics may claim that that the study in question may have been more about flogging off flea collars and pet food than advancing the cause of scientific inquiry . we , however , would never insinuate such a thing . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steven gerrard added a second goal just before time to complete scoring at anfield . meanwhile , chelsea were playing out a goalless draw away to greek side olympiakos , in a match that saw germany captain michael ballack return to champions league action . as rome came from behind to beat spanish league leader real madrid 2-1 .

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , that sending an eu mission to kovoso would be a breach of international law , and called the plan symbolic of the west 's double standard in recognizing kosovo 's independence from serbia . the european union has already agreed to send a mission to kosovo , consisting of some 2,000 police officers , justice and customs officials to aid and train authorities there and help stabilize the region following kosovo 's declaration of independence . russia on wednesday said kosovo 's proclamation of independence was a " gross violation " of international law and said the eu mission had no legal basis since the decision was made without approval from the u.n. security council . " the european union , unilaterally , and without any sanction from the un security council , is sending a mission to kosovo to ensure the supremacy of the law , " russian foreign minister sergey lavrov told reporters at a news briefing with turkish foreign minister ali babacan .

" former brutality negates moral rights " russia is a close serbian ally , and as a permanent member of the united nations security council , opposed kosovo from making its split from belgrade . kosovo delared its independence on sunday , with the united states and many of europe 's largest nations , including germany , having recognized the state .
serbia has since recalled its ambassador from berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians in europe even celebrated sunday 's declaration of independence the west has maintained that serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of kosovo due to brutality under the late serbian president slobodan milosevic . serbs , however , see kosovo as the cradle of their culture and the region is home to numerous orthodox monasteries , prompting serbs to say they will never surrender the province . the eu is expected to deploy its mission by june .
authorities are to help oversee institution-building , and would have limited rights to help fight organized crime and corruption or track down war criminals . kosovo has been a un protectorate since 1999 when nato carried out bombing raids to end a conflict between serbian security forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

but the game also revealed some weaknesses in schalke 's squad . the german side entered uncharted waters on tuesday , feb.19 , playing for the first time ever in the knock-out stage of the champions league .
and despite some uneasy passages , they sailed through with a 1-0 win over former title holders porto . the 54,000 fans in the sold-out schalke arena were visibly and audibly excited about the match , and the level of support seemed to intimidate the visitors , who fell behind after only four minutes . porto 's brazilian keeper helton could only parry a crisply taken shot by schalke defender rafinha into the middle , and striker kevin kuranyi was on hand to swipe the ball into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah was ineffective for schalke schalke had the better of the first but failed to convert any of their chances and extend their lead . the hosts came out flat after the break - with porto having more and more of the ball as the second half progressed .
in particular , schalke had trouble linking the midfield and the attack , a recurring problem this season . their young keeper manuel neuer also had a couple of wobbly moments that might have proved costly against a more offensively proficient foe . but porto forward lisandro lopez squandered the visitors ' best chance for an equalizer , somehow deflecting a cross in the 80th minute away from a tantalizingly open goal . schalke held on for a tight - and historic - win and are now in the driver 's seat for the return match in porto on march 5 . liverpool recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inter were left hanging their heads at anfield in the night 's other action , liverpool rebounded from their disastrous results in the fa cup and the premiership , to book a 2-0 home win over serie a leaders inter milan . marco materazzi - the world 's most famous head-butt recipient - did the hosts a favor by getting sent off in the 30th minute . but it took 55 minutes before striker dirk kuyt could exploit the man advantage and put liverpool in front .
steven gerrard added a second goal just before time to complete scoring at anfield . meanwhile , chelsea were playing out a goalless draw away to greek side olympiakos , in a match that saw germany captain michael ballack return to champions league action . as rome came from behind to beat spanish league leader real madrid 2-1 .

possible strikes could have affected key sectors of german industry . germany 's largest union , which includes 2.3 million members , managed to secure a wage increase of 5.2 percent from march for the next 13 months .
in addition , the ig metall union negotiated that employers are to make a one-time payment of 200 euros -lrb- $ 290 -rrb- for the month of february . the deal is a major wage agreement and is seen as providing a framework for upcoming talks for some 8,000 steelworkers in the eastern german steel industry and talks in the western state of saarland later in the year . wednesday 's agreement affects manufacturers in the core steelmaking states of north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bremen , along with related plants in other states . ig metall negotiating chief oliver burkhard was pleased with the outcome , with the wage increase the highest in the sector in 15 years .
the union had entered negotiations with a demand of eight percent . government pleased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers have abstained from striking in the past employers ' negotiator helmut koch acknowledged that the major german steelmakers had compromised for fear of strikes .

speaking to german public broadcasters , however , scholz said the government would not comment on the exact details of the wage agreements . given the two years of solid growth in 2006 and 2007 in germany , workers were likely entitled to substantial rises after years of restraint . ig metall was not able to secure its demand for a shorter working week for older workers , but ig metall chief burkhard said the issue would remain on the table for the future . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the game also revealed some weaknesses in schalke 's squad . the german side entered uncharted waters on tuesday , feb.19 , playing for the first time ever in the knock-out stage of the champions league .
and despite some uneasy passages , they sailed through with a 1-0 win over former title holders porto . the 54,000 fans in the sold-out schalke arena were visibly and audibly excited about the match , and the level of support seemed to intimidate the visitors , who fell behind after only four minutes . porto 's brazilian keeper helton could only parry a crisply taken shot by schalke defender rafinha into the middle , and striker kevin kuranyi was on hand to swipe the ball into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah was ineffective for schalke schalke had the better of the first but failed to convert any of their chances and extend their lead . the hosts came out flat after the break - with porto having more and more of the ball as the second half progressed .
in particular , schalke had trouble linking the midfield and the attack , a recurring problem this season . their young keeper manuel neuer also had a couple of wobbly moments that might have proved costly against a more offensively proficient foe . but porto forward lisandro lopez squandered the visitors ' best chance for an equalizer , somehow deflecting a cross in the 80th minute away from a tantalizingly open goal . schalke held on for a tight - and historic - win and are now in the driver 's seat for the return match in porto on march 5 . liverpool recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inter were left hanging their heads at anfield in the night 's other action , liverpool rebounded from their disastrous results in the fa cup and the premiership , to book a 2-0 home win over serie a leaders inter milan . marco materazzi - the world 's most famous head-butt recipient - did the hosts a favor by getting sent off in the 30th minute . but it took 55 minutes before striker dirk kuyt could exploit the man advantage and put liverpool in front .
steven gerrard added a second goal just before time to complete scoring at anfield . meanwhile , chelsea were playing out a goalless draw away to greek side olympiakos , in a match that saw germany captain michael ballack return to champions league action . as rome came from behind to beat spanish league leader real madrid 2-1 .

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the last thing that the cubans need in the difficult transition period ahead is advice from outside , from neo-liberal redeemers and democratic smart alecks , " wrote switzerland 's tagesanzeiger .
" above all , the united states should show restraint , particularly because its relationship with the island 150 kilometers off miami is on the verge of being neurotic . " " the country can only seize the chance to start afresh if its almighty neighbor gives it that opportunity , " the zurich-based paper added . germany 's frankfurter rundschau concluded that the outlook for cuba was not optimistic because of the failure of castro 's cuba .
" many people will leave , particularly the younger generation , and external pressure to impose a system based on a western blueprint will not let up , " wrote the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romantic or just plain ramshackle ?
" there are not many reasons to mourn the passing of fidel castro 's cuba .
but there is just as little ground to have unbounded enthusiasm about the foreseeable alternatives . " paris ' le figaro commented that it was time for the west to call for cuba to be truly liberalized .
" now is the time to be constructive and optimistic , " the newspaper wrote . " change has begun in cuba and europe is prepared to help those political leaders on the island who want a peaceful transition , who want to release political prisoners and aim to organize elections in the future , so that cubans can finally decide their own fate , " it continued . denmark 's jyllands posten blamed tourism for helping castro to survive the collapse of the soviet union and remain in power for so long .

there were , however , some protests from euroskeptics demanding referenda . parliamentarians endorsed the treaty by 525-115 with 29 abstentions .
european commission vice president margot wallstrom told lawmakers that the agreement signed by heads of state and government in the portuguese capital last december " strengthens europe 's democratic legitimacy " .
all 27 eu member states must individually ratify the wide-ranging text for it to come into effect by next year , as scheduled .
but only ireland is constitutionally bound to put it to a plebiscite .
the governments of france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia have already approved the document on behalf of their citizens .
euroskeptics accuse the eu leaders of refusing to give citizens a say on a text that is practically identical to the draft european consitution already rejected by french and dutch voters in referenda in 2005 .
the constitution repackaged ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are angry that the peoples ' voice has been ignored like the rejected charter , the treaty provides for a longer-term president and a foreign policy envoy , a simpler , more streamlined decision-making system and more say for the national and european parliaments .
it does not include such symbols of statehood as a flag or an anthem .
the agreement was painstakingly hammered out over months and includes key policy opt-outs for britain and poland from the eu 's charter of fundamental rights and judicial co-operation .
" this is nothing less than a massive exercise in deceit , " said nigel farage of the uk independence party .
he reminded parliamentarians that former british prime minister tony blair had promised the british people a referendum on the constitution .
defence of parliamentary ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german conservative mep was n't feeling benevolent towards the eurosceptic protesters slovenian secretary of state for european affairs janez lenarcic , whose country holds the rotating presidency , responded : " there is nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification .
all eu member states are representative parliamentary democracies . "
european parliament president hans-gert poettering , a german christian democrat , said the assembly represented the european people .
he told the protesters : " if your parents could see you , they would be ashamed . "
spanish conservative mep , inigo mendez de vigo , who was one of the authors of a parliamentary report on the lisbon treaty , welcomed the agreement .
" the treaty is a political solution , a compromise to get us out of the crisis , the impasse .
but it also gives the european union all the instruments to respond to the concerns of the citizens . " dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de future face of european union plagued by uncertainty often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .

possible strikes could have affected key sectors of german industry . germany 's largest union , which includes 2.3 million members , managed to secure a wage increase of 5.2 percent from march for the next 13 months .
in addition , the ig metall union negotiated that employers are to make a one-time payment of 200 euros -lrb- $ 290 -rrb- for the month of february . the deal is a major wage agreement and is seen as providing a framework for upcoming talks for some 8,000 steelworkers in the eastern german steel industry and talks in the western state of saarland later in the year . wednesday 's agreement affects manufacturers in the core steelmaking states of north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bremen , along with related plants in other states . ig metall negotiating chief oliver burkhard was pleased with the outcome , with the wage increase the highest in the sector in 15 years .
the union had entered negotiations with a demand of eight percent . government pleased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers have abstained from striking in the past employers ' negotiator helmut koch acknowledged that the major german steelmakers had compromised for fear of strikes .

an average of 16.6 bags per 1,000 air passengers were delayed in 2007 , compared with 15.7 the previous year , the air transport users council said .
ba , the poorest performer in 2006 with 23 bags per 1,000 delayed , was ranked second worst in 2007 with 26.5 bags .
a ba spokesman said the one-bag rule and heightened security had not helped .
the air transport users council -lrb- auc -rrb- said complaints made to them showed luggage delays could be stressful , inconvenient and expensive for travellers .
worst-performing airlines tap air portugal british airways klm alitalia air france its figures relate to members of the association of european airlines , but not all carriers submitted figures , including virgin atlantic airways and aer lingus .
among those that did , the worst-performing airline last year was tap air portugal with a delayed bags ratio of 27.8 per 1,000 passengers .
other below-average performers included klm -lrb- 19.7 bags delayed per 1,000 passengers -rrb- , alitalia -lrb- 19.7 -rrb- , air france -lrb- 17.6 -rrb- , luxair -lrb- 17.2 -rrb- and the uk 's bmi -lrb- 17.0 -rrb- .
the best-performing airlines were air malta and turkish airlines with a lost bag ratio of 4.5 per 1,000 passengers in 2007 .
best and worst performers airlines operating through " hub " airports such as heathrow fared the worst last year , the auc said .
it said this was partly due to the increased levels of hold luggage as a result of the one-bag rule at uk airports .
auc chairman tina tietjen said : " but , whatever the extenuating circumstances , when passengers hand their bag in at check-in , they should expect to see their bag at the other end . "
british airways apologised to customers affected by baggage delays last year .
ba director of operations gareth kirkwood said : " while our performance at the vast majority of global airports remains good , we continue to experience a wide variety of difficulties at our main home at heathrow .

an average of 16.6 bags per 1,000 air passengers were delayed in 2007 , compared with 15.7 the previous year , the air transport users council said .
ba , the poorest performer in 2006 with 23 bags per 1,000 delayed , was ranked second worst in 2007 with 26.5 bags .
a ba spokesman said the one-bag rule and heightened security had not helped .
the air transport users council -lrb- auc -rrb- said complaints made to them showed luggage delays could be stressful , inconvenient and expensive for travellers .
worst-performing airlines tap air portugal british airways klm alitalia air france its figures relate to members of the association of european airlines , but not all carriers submitted figures , including virgin atlantic airways and aer lingus .
among those that did , the worst-performing airline last year was tap air portugal with a delayed bags ratio of 27.8 per 1,000 passengers .
other below-average performers included klm -lrb- 19.7 bags delayed per 1,000 passengers -rrb- , alitalia -lrb- 19.7 -rrb- , air france -lrb- 17.6 -rrb- , luxair -lrb- 17.2 -rrb- and the uk 's bmi -lrb- 17.0 -rrb- .
the best-performing airlines were air malta and turkish airlines with a lost bag ratio of 4.5 per 1,000 passengers in 2007 .
best and worst performers airlines operating through " hub " airports such as heathrow fared the worst last year , the auc said .
it said this was partly due to the increased levels of hold luggage as a result of the one-bag rule at uk airports .
auc chairman tina tietjen said : " but , whatever the extenuating circumstances , when passengers hand their bag in at check-in , they should expect to see their bag at the other end . "
british airways apologised to customers affected by baggage delays last year .
ba director of operations gareth kirkwood said : " while our performance at the vast majority of global airports remains good , we continue to experience a wide variety of difficulties at our main home at heathrow .
" although heathrow airport continues to suffer from a very stretched infrastructure running at almost double capacity , we also accept that on occasions our own levels of service have not been as high as we would like . "
a baa spokesman said its baggage infrastructure was " very resilient " and the opening of terminal 5 in less than two months would bring much needed terminal and infrastructure capacity .
