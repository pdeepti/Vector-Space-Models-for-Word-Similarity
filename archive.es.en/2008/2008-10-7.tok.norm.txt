and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .

i was going to new york to receive another prize , the horwitz prize at columbia university , and then the captain came to me and asked , " are you mr. ernst ? "
i said , " yes , what can i do for you ? "
he said , " you 've just won a prize . "
and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .
people listen to me .
and the people expect a scientific lecture from me and are then very disappointed that they get preached to about morals .
i try to capitalize on that . if the past , you 've mentioned the negative effects winning such a prize can have .
what are the aspects of being a nobel winner that a normal person might not be able to imagine ? people are more critical of you .
of course they pay attention to you more , but at the same time they are more critical .
for example , i 've noticed that it is more difficult to publish a paper with the nobel prize in my pocket , because now the people really read the paper - and they try to find a mistake .
it 's a great pleasure to find a mistake in the work of a nobel prize winner .
nobody would be looking for this with a normal person . what did you do with the prize money ? it went towards various things .
a portion for my own research , a portion for charitable organizations , a portion supports my research and collection in the asian filed .
it actually went towards various goals . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the a sample of the 27-year-old german , who was to join the belgian quick step team in the new year , returned a positive result for cera -lrb- continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator -rrb- after a new test .
holczer said he has immediately suspended schumacher from the team .
schumacher won the two time trials during this year 's tour de france and wore the yellow jersey of the overall leader for two days .
" we were cheated .
i will use the last cent in my pocket to take legal steps against him .
i had no suspicions , " he said , adding that schumacher has already been tested 13 times this year by the sport 's controlling body uci .
the french sports paper l 'equipe reported monday on its web site that schumacher only tested positive for cera after a combination of two tests was conducted on a blood sample .
saunier duval rider leornardo piepoli also tested positive and will have to attend an italian olympic committee hearing on friday .
his team-mate riccardo ricco , who already tested positive during the tour and has received a two-year ban , is said to have also tested positive again with the new testing methods .
the re-tests for cera were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during the tour .
schumacher 's team- and room-mate austrian berhard kohl , who finished third in this year 's tour , told austrian journalists that he did not want to comment on the case .
" i spoke to stefan on the phone today and he should really be the first one to hear of these matters .
i want to say nothing until it is official , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .

doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

awaiting former uefa champions schalke will be europe 's recently crowned richest club , manchester city , which is bristling with offensive power after recently bringing on former real madrid star robinho and ex-chelsea attacking midfielder shaun wright-phillips .
the blue and whites also face paris st germain , spain 's real santander and fc twente , who sit mid-table in the dutch eredivisie .
jol excited by group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv coach martin jol is eagerly awaiting his club 's uefa cup clashes current bundesliga table-topers hamburg , who have been victorious in five of their seven outings in the national league this season , will face dutch outfit ajax , who have endured a slow start to the domestic ‘ 08- ‘ 09 season , as well as slavia prague , aston villa and msk zilina of slovakia .
hamburg coach martin jol said he relished the chance his club will have to prove itself against what he believed will be strong opposition .

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .
" there are always difficult stages , but in the end there were always celebrations and satisfaction .
it will be the same this time around . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .
berlin 's action prompted other countries to say that they planned to follow suit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.10.2008 germany extends afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to send an additional 1,000 soldiers to afghanistan chancellor merkel 's cabinet tuesday extended germany 's commitment of troops to afghanistan even as the defense ministry said it will no longer send elite soldiers to back us-led counterterrorism operations . germany 's cabinet on tuesday , oct 7 , extended the german army 's military presence in afghanistan by 14 months and also agreed to beef up the mission with an additional 1,000 soldiers in the face of worsening security .
germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget .

she told dw about her post-nobel duties and her love for the outdoors . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1995 ?
christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .
how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize ?
it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .
the prize also gave developmental biology some momentum , thrusting it into the spotlight .
does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .
for example , conveying science to the public , taking part in ethics committees , advising , being on many boards and writing reports .
so at the time i suffered a little bit .
at first everyone was very excited and then a big wave of envy came and then i received all of these responsibilities and if you say no , people say that you have no sense of responsibility .
but i always tried to do my duty .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was n't gifted when it came to languages .
i mostly copied in latin and in english i was often on the verge of a five -lrb- the lowest grade - eds . -rrb- . but i was often an only student in art and music .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
i actually do n't want to research in any other discipline .
my siblings all studied art or architecture .
but as a child , i was already interested in animals and plants .
even back then i wanted to be a natural scientist .
and my parents were great in supporting me .
i was always in the garden or forest and always had my eyes on the ground because i was looking for plants and animals .
but i also find chemistry and physics interesting , in addition to biology . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2008 merkel says a " strong " germany can handle crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is strong and will cope in this crisis , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel called tuesday , oct .
7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech .

germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .

steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .

taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .

he talked to dw about the artistic side of his field , his interest in music and life after nobel . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your 2007 nobel prize ?
gerhard ertl : i got a call at my office from sweden at 11:30 in the morning .
at first i was quite speechless and , to be completely honest , tears even came to my eyes .
i could hardly believe it .
and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ?
the world was suddenly different because a nobel prize can be viewed as the crowning achievement in the life of a scientist .
and the fact that is was awarded to me on my birthday – well , i ca n't imagine anything nicer .
are there negative implications as well ?
none other than that my meetings were turned upside down from one day to the next .
all hell broke loose , but i enjoyed it .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was a dud in sports – and i still am today .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
today i would probably choose biology .
in my time it was still an absolutely descriptive science .
we called it the counting bug legs science .
but today , in my opinion , molecular biology is much more promising than the classic natural sciences .
but musicology could interest me as well .
music in any case .

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .
i did that because i felt they had supported me well and i wanted to show how grateful i was . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.10.2008 germany extends afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to send an additional 1,000 soldiers to afghanistan chancellor merkel 's cabinet tuesday extended germany 's commitment of troops to afghanistan even as the defense ministry said it will no longer send elite soldiers to back us-led counterterrorism operations . germany 's cabinet on tuesday , oct 7 , extended the german army 's military presence in afghanistan by 14 months and also agreed to beef up the mission with an additional 1,000 soldiers in the face of worsening security .
germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .
" there are always difficult stages , but in the end there were always celebrations and satisfaction .
it will be the same this time around . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .
i did that because i felt they had supported me well and i wanted to show how grateful i was . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw about his plans for improving the planet and his passion for tibetan art and culture . deutsche welle : what are the main global challenges mankind faces at the moment ? richard ernst : i think they are maintaining the environmental and living conditions so that future generations will also have the opportunity to service and shape a life like the one we are used to . how do you want to achieve this ? we need to make people aware of what they are actually doing .
and we need to look ahead to the future and think about how what we do will affect it . can the world still be saved ? i think so .
but , above all , we must not cling passively to this illusion .
we need this for the future .
of course everything that we do is dissipative and we ca n't undo what we 've already done .
we create terminal disturbances in the system and we need to minimize these . how are you personally trying to improve the world ? firstly , i give a lot of presentations .
i , personally , lead a simple life and try to minimize my needs as much as i can .
in other countries , including developing countries , i try to have an effect my motivating people .
i am still a university professor , and i try to convince young people about the right path to take . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to conduct research ? i have a second passion to fall back on and that 's asian art .
i 'm also interested in tibet and tibetan paintings in particular .
so i have plenty of interests along the lines of cultural anthropology .
and the entire history of central asia , for example , which is extremely complicated and extremely interesting .
i find it fascinating to try and understand a foreign culture . which subject did you dislike in school ? languages .
as a small boy , i did n't speak any language at all .
and my parents thought that maybe i was n't too bright .
i developed my own language that nobody other than my sister understood .
she was my translator and she translated what i said for my parents .
this language was made up of words i invented that nobody else used . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1991 ? that was really exciting .
i was on an airplane flying from moscow to new york .
i was going to new york to receive another prize , the horwitz prize at columbia university , and then the captain came to me and asked , " are you mr. ernst ? "
i said , " yes , what can i do for you ? "
he said , " you 've just won a prize . "
and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .
people listen to me .
and the people expect a scientific lecture from me and are then very disappointed that they get preached to about morals .
i try to capitalize on that . if the past , you 've mentioned the negative effects winning such a prize can have .
what are the aspects of being a nobel winner that a normal person might not be able to imagine ? people are more critical of you .
of course they pay attention to you more , but at the same time they are more critical .
for example , i 've noticed that it is more difficult to publish a paper with the nobel prize in my pocket , because now the people really read the paper - and they try to find a mistake .
it 's a great pleasure to find a mistake in the work of a nobel prize winner .
nobody would be looking for this with a normal person . what did you do with the prize money ? it went towards various things .
a portion for my own research , a portion for charitable organizations , a portion supports my research and collection in the asian filed .
it actually went towards various goals . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2008 merkel says a " strong " germany can handle crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is strong and will cope in this crisis , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel called tuesday , oct .
7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .
berlin 's action prompted other countries to say that they planned to follow suit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2008 merkel says a " strong " germany can handle crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is strong and will cope in this crisis , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel called tuesday , oct .
7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .
berlin 's action prompted other countries to say that they planned to follow suit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have agreed to support systemic financial institutions , " deputy german finance minister joerg asmussen told reporters after the luxembourg talks . eu markets continue spiral bad financial news continued to pile up in europe despite the last-minute rescue late sunday of one of germany 's most important banking institutions , commercial property lender hypo real estate .

but germany wants to avoid being stuck with a massive bill for the bailout of other countries ' failed financial institutions .
instead , merkel continues to call for tighter market controls over the banking sector .
a common pledge while there is no agreement on a bailout , european leaders vowed they would " continue to take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors , ” according to a joint statement read monday by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" european leaders acknowledge the need for close coordination and cooperation , " sarkozy said .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .
berlin 's action prompted other countries to say that they planned to follow suit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .

it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.10.2008 germany extends afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to send an additional 1,000 soldiers to afghanistan chancellor merkel 's cabinet tuesday extended germany 's commitment of troops to afghanistan even as the defense ministry said it will no longer send elite soldiers to back us-led counterterrorism operations . germany 's cabinet on tuesday , oct 7 , extended the german army 's military presence in afghanistan by 14 months and also agreed to beef up the mission with an additional 1,000 soldiers in the face of worsening security .
germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.10.2008 germany extends afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to send an additional 1,000 soldiers to afghanistan chancellor merkel 's cabinet tuesday extended germany 's commitment of troops to afghanistan even as the defense ministry said it will no longer send elite soldiers to back us-led counterterrorism operations . germany 's cabinet on tuesday , oct 7 , extended the german army 's military presence in afghanistan by 14 months and also agreed to beef up the mission with an additional 1,000 soldiers in the face of worsening security .
germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ca n't see defense is going to escape any kind of austerity measures , " said defense economist mark stoker from the london institute , as quoted by reuters .
" it would be very difficult for any government to justify cutting health and education in favour of , say , building two aircraft carriers and buying a load of planes to stick on them . "
military spending budgets for iraq and afghanistan would likely escape any re-rationalization as a result of global financial strains , the analysts also said .
" there would n't be an appetite to cut back on the pursuit of an important objective to the united states in the name of near-term economic gain , " said lieutenant-colonel nathan freier of the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington , reuters reported .

and with hundreds of billions of euros being wielded by european states to prop up flailing financial institutions and with excess budgets a possible rarity in the short-term , eu countries may be pushed into tighter military union in an effort to avoid duplication of the 27-member bloc 's limited resources .
governmental bail-outs were announced tuesday , sept .

french defense minister herve morin , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said last week that the current crisis showed the need for greater european military and defense cooperation .
morin and french president nicolas sarkozy have been pushing for a boost in europe 's defensive capabilities , insisting wednesday , oct .

russia steps up spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's military spending is set to hit $ 58 billion by 2011 further confusing the issue of the defense of europe for eu states was news tuesday that the kremlin would boost its own defense spending by 25 percent next year , raising the figure from $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion .
although moscow 's military budget remains roughly a tenth of that of the us for 2008 , the west nonetheless harbours fears of a resurgent russia , particularly in light of its august war with georgia which saw russian troops overwhelm the small caucasus nation and recognize two breakaway georgian enclaves as independent states .
only venezuela followed moscow 's lead in recognizing the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
having emerged as an energy superpower , russia has drawn europe into near dependence on its resources , another sticking point in relations between the eu and moscow . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have agreed to support systemic financial institutions , " deputy german finance minister joerg asmussen told reporters after the luxembourg talks . eu markets continue spiral bad financial news continued to pile up in europe despite the last-minute rescue late sunday of one of germany 's most important banking institutions , commercial property lender hypo real estate .
markets in frankfurt , london and paris continued their downward spiral on tuesday with investors continuing to worry over the strength of financial institutions .

but germany wants to avoid being stuck with a massive bill for the bailout of other countries ' failed financial institutions .
instead , merkel continues to call for tighter market controls over the banking sector .
a common pledge while there is no agreement on a bailout , european leaders vowed they would " continue to take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors , ” according to a joint statement read monday by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .
berlin 's action prompted other countries to say that they planned to follow suit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .
i did that because i felt they had supported me well and i wanted to show how grateful i was . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw about his plans for improving the planet and his passion for tibetan art and culture . deutsche welle : what are the main global challenges mankind faces at the moment ? richard ernst : i think they are maintaining the environmental and living conditions so that future generations will also have the opportunity to service and shape a life like the one we are used to . how do you want to achieve this ? we need to make people aware of what they are actually doing .
and we need to look ahead to the future and think about how what we do will affect it . can the world still be saved ? i think so .
but , above all , we must not cling passively to this illusion .
we need this for the future .
of course everything that we do is dissipative and we ca n't undo what we 've already done .
we create terminal disturbances in the system and we need to minimize these . how are you personally trying to improve the world ? firstly , i give a lot of presentations .
i , personally , lead a simple life and try to minimize my needs as much as i can .
in other countries , including developing countries , i try to have an effect my motivating people .
i am still a university professor , and i try to convince young people about the right path to take . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to conduct research ? i have a second passion to fall back on and that 's asian art .
i 'm also interested in tibet and tibetan paintings in particular .
so i have plenty of interests along the lines of cultural anthropology .
and the entire history of central asia , for example , which is extremely complicated and extremely interesting .
i find it fascinating to try and understand a foreign culture . which subject did you dislike in school ? languages .
as a small boy , i did n't speak any language at all .
and my parents thought that maybe i was n't too bright .
i developed my own language that nobody other than my sister understood .
she was my translator and she translated what i said for my parents .
this language was made up of words i invented that nobody else used . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1991 ? that was really exciting .
i was on an airplane flying from moscow to new york .
i was going to new york to receive another prize , the horwitz prize at columbia university , and then the captain came to me and asked , " are you mr. ernst ? "
i said , " yes , what can i do for you ? "
he said , " you 've just won a prize . "
and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .
people listen to me .
and the people expect a scientific lecture from me and are then very disappointed that they get preached to about morals .
i try to capitalize on that . if the past , you 've mentioned the negative effects winning such a prize can have .
what are the aspects of being a nobel winner that a normal person might not be able to imagine ? people are more critical of you .
of course they pay attention to you more , but at the same time they are more critical .
for example , i 've noticed that it is more difficult to publish a paper with the nobel prize in my pocket , because now the people really read the paper - and they try to find a mistake .
it 's a great pleasure to find a mistake in the work of a nobel prize winner .
nobody would be looking for this with a normal person . what did you do with the prize money ? it went towards various things .
a portion for my own research , a portion for charitable organizations , a portion supports my research and collection in the asian filed .
it actually went towards various goals . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we need this for the future .
of course everything that we do is dissipative and we ca n't undo what we 've already done .
we create terminal disturbances in the system and we need to minimize these . how are you personally trying to improve the world ? firstly , i give a lot of presentations .
i , personally , lead a simple life and try to minimize my needs as much as i can .

he said , " you 've just won a prize . "
and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .

i 'm also interested in tibet and tibetan paintings in particular .
so i have plenty of interests along the lines of cultural anthropology .
and the entire history of central asia , for example , which is extremely complicated and extremely interesting .
i find it fascinating to try and understand a foreign culture . which subject did you dislike in school ? languages .
as a small boy , i did n't speak any language at all .
and my parents thought that maybe i was n't too bright .
i developed my own language that nobody other than my sister understood .
she was my translator and she translated what i said for my parents .
this language was made up of words i invented that nobody else used . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1991 ? that was really exciting .
i was on an airplane flying from moscow to new york .
i was going to new york to receive another prize , the horwitz prize at columbia university , and then the captain came to me and asked , " are you mr. ernst ? "
i said , " yes , what can i do for you ? "
he said , " you 've just won a prize . "
and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .
people listen to me .
and the people expect a scientific lecture from me and are then very disappointed that they get preached to about morals .
i try to capitalize on that . if the past , you 've mentioned the negative effects winning such a prize can have .
what are the aspects of being a nobel winner that a normal person might not be able to imagine ? people are more critical of you .
of course they pay attention to you more , but at the same time they are more critical .
for example , i 've noticed that it is more difficult to publish a paper with the nobel prize in my pocket , because now the people really read the paper - and they try to find a mistake .
it 's a great pleasure to find a mistake in the work of a nobel prize winner .
nobody would be looking for this with a normal person . what did you do with the prize money ? it went towards various things .
a portion for my own research , a portion for charitable organizations , a portion supports my research and collection in the asian filed .
it actually went towards various goals . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.10.2008 germany extends afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to send an additional 1,000 soldiers to afghanistan chancellor merkel 's cabinet tuesday extended germany 's commitment of troops to afghanistan even as the defense ministry said it will no longer send elite soldiers to back us-led counterterrorism operations . germany 's cabinet on tuesday , oct 7 , extended the german army 's military presence in afghanistan by 14 months and also agreed to beef up the mission with an additional 1,000 soldiers in the face of worsening security .
germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .

germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .

" in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .

" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .

" i ca n't see defense is going to escape any kind of austerity measures , " said defense economist mark stoker from the london institute , as quoted by reuters .
" it would be very difficult for any government to justify cutting health and education in favour of , say , building two aircraft carriers and buying a load of planes to stick on them . "
military spending budgets for iraq and afghanistan would likely escape any re-rationalization as a result of global financial strains , the analysts also said .
" there would n't be an appetite to cut back on the pursuit of an important objective to the united states in the name of near-term economic gain , " said lieutenant-colonel nathan freier of the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington , reuters reported .

and with hundreds of billions of euros being wielded by european states to prop up flailing financial institutions and with excess budgets a possible rarity in the short-term , eu countries may be pushed into tighter military union in an effort to avoid duplication of the 27-member bloc 's limited resources .

french defense minister herve morin , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said last week that the current crisis showed the need for greater european military and defense cooperation .
morin and french president nicolas sarkozy have been pushing for a boost in europe 's defensive capabilities , insisting wednesday , oct .
1 , that the financial crisis was creating a " new equilibrium " in world power .
" we must learn the consequences for us , europeans , that there are a certain number of things that can not be solved at the national level , " morin said before the start of an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
russia steps up spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's military spending is set to hit $ 58 billion by 2011 further confusing the issue of the defense of europe for eu states was news tuesday that the kremlin would boost its own defense spending by 25 percent next year , raising the figure from $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion .
although moscow 's military budget remains roughly a tenth of that of the us for 2008 , the west nonetheless harbours fears of a resurgent russia , particularly in light of its august war with georgia which saw russian troops overwhelm the small caucasus nation and recognize two breakaway georgian enclaves as independent states .
only venezuela followed moscow 's lead in recognizing the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
having emerged as an energy superpower , russia has drawn europe into near dependence on its resources , another sticking point in relations between the eu and moscow . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants .

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .

after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 07.10.2008 bundesliga clubs face stiff test after uefa cup draw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , the uefa cup will take on a new format germany ’ s five uefa cup representatives will have to overcome an assortment of europe ’ s most respected football clubs to reach the next stage of the pan-european championship . each of the german clubs - schalke 04 , hertha bsc berlin , vfb stuttgart , vfl wolfsburg and hamburg - was pooled in separate groups , with germany being the most heavily represented nation at this stage of the tournament .
awaiting former uefa champions schalke will be europe 's recently crowned richest club , manchester city , which is bristling with offensive power after recently bringing on former real madrid star robinho and ex-chelsea attacking midfielder shaun wright-phillips .
the blue and whites also face paris st germain , spain 's real santander and fc twente , who sit mid-table in the dutch eredivisie .
jol excited by group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg sv coach martin jol is eagerly awaiting his club 's uefa cup clashes current bundesliga table-topers hamburg , who have been victorious in five of their seven outings in the national league this season , will face dutch outfit ajax , who have endured a slow start to the domestic ‘ 08- ‘ 09 season , as well as slavia prague , aston villa and msk zilina of slovakia .
hamburg coach martin jol said he relished the chance his club will have to prove itself against what he believed will be strong opposition .
" ajax amsterdam is a big club , aston villa is the favorite of the group for me , slavia prague has been improving and msk zilina is a very compact team which sits second in the slovak league , " he said , as quoted on the club 's web site .

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .
" there are always difficult stages , but in the end there were always celebrations and satisfaction .
it will be the same this time around . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .
" there are always difficult stages , but in the end there were always celebrations and satisfaction .
it will be the same this time around . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .

christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .

it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .

does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .

she told dw about her post-nobel duties and her love for the outdoors . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1995 ?
christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .
how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize ?
it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .
the prize also gave developmental biology some momentum , thrusting it into the spotlight .
does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .
for example , conveying science to the public , taking part in ethics committees , advising , being on many boards and writing reports .
so at the time i suffered a little bit .
at first everyone was very excited and then a big wave of envy came and then i received all of these responsibilities and if you say no , people say that you have no sense of responsibility .
but i always tried to do my duty .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was n't gifted when it came to languages .
i mostly copied in latin and in english i was often on the verge of a five -lrb- the lowest grade - eds . -rrb- . but i was often an only student in art and music .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
i actually do n't want to research in any other discipline .
my siblings all studied art or architecture .
but as a child , i was already interested in animals and plants .
even back then i wanted to be a natural scientist .
and my parents were great in supporting me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2008 merkel says a " strong " germany can handle crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is strong and will cope in this crisis , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel called tuesday , oct .
7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .

germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season .

" i ca n't see defense is going to escape any kind of austerity measures , " said defense economist mark stoker from the london institute , as quoted by reuters .
" it would be very difficult for any government to justify cutting health and education in favour of , say , building two aircraft carriers and buying a load of planes to stick on them . "
military spending budgets for iraq and afghanistan would likely escape any re-rationalization as a result of global financial strains , the analysts also said .
" there would n't be an appetite to cut back on the pursuit of an important objective to the united states in the name of near-term economic gain , " said lieutenant-colonel nathan freier of the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington , reuters reported .

and with hundreds of billions of euros being wielded by european states to prop up flailing financial institutions and with excess budgets a possible rarity in the short-term , eu countries may be pushed into tighter military union in an effort to avoid duplication of the 27-member bloc 's limited resources .
governmental bail-outs were announced tuesday , sept .

french defense minister herve morin , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said last week that the current crisis showed the need for greater european military and defense cooperation .
morin and french president nicolas sarkozy have been pushing for a boost in europe 's defensive capabilities , insisting wednesday , oct .

" we must learn the consequences for us , europeans , that there are a certain number of things that can not be solved at the national level , " morin said before the start of an informal meeting with eu counterparts .

although moscow 's military budget remains roughly a tenth of that of the us for 2008 , the west nonetheless harbours fears of a resurgent russia , particularly in light of its august war with georgia which saw russian troops overwhelm the small caucasus nation and recognize two breakaway georgian enclaves as independent states .
only venezuela followed moscow 's lead in recognizing the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .

schumacher won the two time trials during this year 's tour de france and wore the yellow jersey of the overall leader for two days .
" we were cheated .
i will use the last cent in my pocket to take legal steps against him .
i had no suspicions , " he said , adding that schumacher has already been tested 13 times this year by the sport 's controlling body uci .
the french sports paper l 'equipe reported monday on its web site that schumacher only tested positive for cera after a combination of two tests was conducted on a blood sample .
saunier duval rider leornardo piepoli also tested positive and will have to attend an italian olympic committee hearing on friday .
his team-mate riccardo ricco , who already tested positive during the tour and has received a two-year ban , is said to have also tested positive again with the new testing methods .
the re-tests for cera were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during the tour .
schumacher 's team- and room-mate austrian berhard kohl , who finished third in this year 's tour , told austrian journalists that he did not want to comment on the case .
" i spoke to stefan on the phone today and he should really be the first one to hear of these matters .
i want to say nothing until it is official , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have agreed to support systemic financial institutions , " deputy german finance minister joerg asmussen told reporters after the luxembourg talks . eu markets continue spiral bad financial news continued to pile up in europe despite the last-minute rescue late sunday of one of germany 's most important banking institutions , commercial property lender hypo real estate .
markets in frankfurt , london and paris continued their downward spiral on tuesday with investors continuing to worry over the strength of financial institutions .
frankfurt stocks fell back into the red midmorning on tuesday as a rebound from steep losses on monday ran out of steam amid fresh worries that german banks would fall victim to the financial crisis .

" merkel pointed out that the government stepped in this weekend with a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bailout of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth-largest bank .
but germany wants to avoid being stuck with a massive bill for the bailout of other countries ' failed financial institutions .
instead , merkel continues to call for tighter market controls over the banking sector .
a common pledge while there is no agreement on a bailout , european leaders vowed they would " continue to take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors , ” according to a joint statement read monday by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" european leaders acknowledge the need for close coordination and cooperation , " sarkozy said .
eu countries have not found common ground on whether to guarantee all money in bank deposits .
ireland and greece moved last week to pass a law which guaranteed all bank deposits .
while germany initially opposed the idea , it seemed poised to change course sunday when merkel offered a " political pledge " guaranteeing money in german banks . denmark , portugal and iceland guaranteed deposits monday and austria , britain , denmark , france , portugal , sweden have announced similar plans are under discussion .
merkel promises clarification merkel 's assurance sunday that all deposits in german banks are secure has not been followed up with specific policy proposals on how the estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- in savings accounts would be protected .
merkel is scheduled address the issue when she speaks to parliament tuesday afternoon .
a clarification is " urgently needed , " said guido westerwelle , head of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party .

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .

" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .

doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .
" there are always difficult stages , but in the end there were always celebrations and satisfaction .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval .

he spoke to dw about his plans for improving the planet and his passion for tibetan art and culture . deutsche welle : what are the main global challenges mankind faces at the moment ? richard ernst : i think they are maintaining the environmental and living conditions so that future generations will also have the opportunity to service and shape a life like the one we are used to . how do you want to achieve this ? we need to make people aware of what they are actually doing .
and we need to look ahead to the future and think about how what we do will affect it . can the world still be saved ? i think so .
but , above all , we must not cling passively to this illusion .
we need this for the future .
of course everything that we do is dissipative and we ca n't undo what we 've already done .
we create terminal disturbances in the system and we need to minimize these . how are you personally trying to improve the world ? firstly , i give a lot of presentations .
i , personally , lead a simple life and try to minimize my needs as much as i can .
in other countries , including developing countries , i try to have an effect my motivating people .
i am still a university professor , and i try to convince young people about the right path to take . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to conduct research ? i have a second passion to fall back on and that 's asian art .
i 'm also interested in tibet and tibetan paintings in particular .
so i have plenty of interests along the lines of cultural anthropology .
and the entire history of central asia , for example , which is extremely complicated and extremely interesting .
i find it fascinating to try and understand a foreign culture . which subject did you dislike in school ? languages .
as a small boy , i did n't speak any language at all .
and my parents thought that maybe i was n't too bright .
i developed my own language that nobody other than my sister understood .
she was my translator and she translated what i said for my parents .
this language was made up of words i invented that nobody else used . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1991 ? that was really exciting .
i was on an airplane flying from moscow to new york .
i was going to new york to receive another prize , the horwitz prize at columbia university , and then the captain came to me and asked , " are you mr. ernst ? "
i said , " yes , what can i do for you ? "
he said , " you 've just won a prize . "
and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .
people listen to me .
and the people expect a scientific lecture from me and are then very disappointed that they get preached to about morals .
i try to capitalize on that . if the past , you 've mentioned the negative effects winning such a prize can have .
what are the aspects of being a nobel winner that a normal person might not be able to imagine ? people are more critical of you .
of course they pay attention to you more , but at the same time they are more critical .
for example , i 've noticed that it is more difficult to publish a paper with the nobel prize in my pocket , because now the people really read the paper - and they try to find a mistake .
it 's a great pleasure to find a mistake in the work of a nobel prize winner .
nobody would be looking for this with a normal person . what did you do with the prize money ? it went towards various things .
a portion for my own research , a portion for charitable organizations , a portion supports my research and collection in the asian filed .
it actually went towards various goals . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.10.2008 germany extends afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to send an additional 1,000 soldiers to afghanistan chancellor merkel 's cabinet tuesday extended germany 's commitment of troops to afghanistan even as the defense ministry said it will no longer send elite soldiers to back us-led counterterrorism operations . germany 's cabinet on tuesday , oct 7 , extended the german army 's military presence in afghanistan by 14 months and also agreed to beef up the mission with an additional 1,000 soldiers in the face of worsening security .
germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .

he talked to dw about the artistic side of his field , his interest in music and life after nobel . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your 2007 nobel prize ?
gerhard ertl : i got a call at my office from sweden at 11:30 in the morning .
at first i was quite speechless and , to be completely honest , tears even came to my eyes .
i could hardly believe it .
and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ?
the world was suddenly different because a nobel prize can be viewed as the crowning achievement in the life of a scientist .
and the fact that is was awarded to me on my birthday – well , i ca n't imagine anything nicer .
are there negative implications as well ?
none other than that my meetings were turned upside down from one day to the next .
all hell broke loose , but i enjoyed it .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was a dud in sports – and i still am today .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
today i would probably choose biology .
in my time it was still an absolutely descriptive science .
we called it the counting bug legs science .
but today , in my opinion , molecular biology is much more promising than the classic natural sciences .
but musicology could interest me as well .
music in any case .
i love to play piano and the harpsichord .
i see many links between chemistry and music .
a lot of researchers have a similar disposition to artists .
and a beautiful paradigm or a nice formula always gives me aesthetic pleasure . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 07.10.2008 germany extends afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is to send an additional 1,000 soldiers to afghanistan chancellor merkel 's cabinet tuesday extended germany 's commitment of troops to afghanistan even as the defense ministry said it will no longer send elite soldiers to back us-led counterterrorism operations . germany 's cabinet on tuesday , oct 7 , extended the german army 's military presence in afghanistan by 14 months and also agreed to beef up the mission with an additional 1,000 soldiers in the face of worsening security .
germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents .
the mandate of the special forces backing the us-led " operation enduring freedom " is separate from germany 's peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan as part of the nato-led isaf force .
focusing on the nato mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops will be reassigned to nato 's isaf the official statement confirming the withdrawal of elite soldiers from afghanistan came two days after germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke out against a new parliamentary mandate for the ksk soldiers at the weekend .
steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .
the number of german troops has increased steadily since the government first sent 1,200 soldiers to afghanistan in 2001 .
defense minister franz josef jung and his generals most recently calling for the number to be increased to 4,500 .
situation getting more dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are facing increasing risks in afghanistan most german soldiers are stationed in the north of the country , removed from the fighting in southern afghanistan .
but even the north has become a danger zone in recent months , with germany 's military camp in the kunduz region coming under rocket fire .
taliban and al-qaeda fighters are active in the north , ulrich kirsch of the bundeswehr association told deutsche welle .
“ the scope of the threat is very high .
there are booby traps and assassinations , ” kirsch said .
“ the booby traps are constantly changing .
the taliban and al-qaida fighters are always coming up with something new .
and it 's impossible to do anything against suicide attackers . ”
kirsch said that the weeks before the mandate comes up for renewal are particularly dangerous times .
enemies are monitoring the german media and know that they can use attacks to influence the debate , he added . involvement seen as crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb attacks and kidnappings are on the rise in afghanistan attacks are increasing because of the german military 's success with humanitarian and rebuilding projects , said social democrat parliamentarian joern thiessen .
“ it is a sign that we are carrying out successful politics in afghanistan , " thiessen said .
" it 's difficult to communicate this , but i believe that it is urgently necessary . ”
but not everyone in the parliament agrees .
even some in the governing coalition , such as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentarian willy wimmer , wants to see a scaling back of troops in afghanistan out of fear that germany is getting pulled depeper and deeper into an unwinnable conflict .
if the war is going to last 40 years , as some predict , then “ it 's time to go , ” wimmer said .
wimmer is n't the only one pessimistic about the ability to defeat the taliban insurgency .
britain 's commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , said in an interview over the weekend that he does not believe the war can be done .
" we 're not going to win this war .
it 's about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that 's not a strategic threat and can be managed by the afghan army , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and then he told me it was the nobel prize - that was a huge surprise . and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? at the beginning , it brought me a lot of duties , in particular over the course of my research and teaching work , which i continued for seven years after winning the prize .
after my becoming a professor emeritus , it gave me first and foremost my voice .
i can now appear at various universities , congresses and private circles and have a voice there .

what are the aspects of being a nobel winner that a normal person might not be able to imagine ? people are more critical of you .
of course they pay attention to you more , but at the same time they are more critical .

she told dw about her post-nobel duties and her love for the outdoors . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1995 ?
christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .
how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize ?
it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .
the prize also gave developmental biology some momentum , thrusting it into the spotlight .
does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .
for example , conveying science to the public , taking part in ethics committees , advising , being on many boards and writing reports .
so at the time i suffered a little bit .
at first everyone was very excited and then a big wave of envy came and then i received all of these responsibilities and if you say no , people say that you have no sense of responsibility .
but i always tried to do my duty .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was n't gifted when it came to languages .
i mostly copied in latin and in english i was often on the verge of a five -lrb- the lowest grade - eds . -rrb- . but i was often an only student in art and music .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
i actually do n't want to research in any other discipline .
my siblings all studied art or architecture .
but as a child , i was already interested in animals and plants .
even back then i wanted to be a natural scientist .
and my parents were great in supporting me .
i was always in the garden or forest and always had my eyes on the ground because i was looking for plants and animals .
but i also find chemistry and physics interesting , in addition to biology . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she told dw about her post-nobel duties and her love for the outdoors . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1995 ?
christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .
how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize ?
it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .
the prize also gave developmental biology some momentum , thrusting it into the spotlight .
does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .
for example , conveying science to the public , taking part in ethics committees , advising , being on many boards and writing reports .
so at the time i suffered a little bit .
at first everyone was very excited and then a big wave of envy came and then i received all of these responsibilities and if you say no , people say that you have no sense of responsibility .
but i always tried to do my duty .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was n't gifted when it came to languages .
i mostly copied in latin and in english i was often on the verge of a five -lrb- the lowest grade - eds . -rrb- . but i was often an only student in art and music .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
i actually do n't want to research in any other discipline .
my siblings all studied art or architecture .
but as a child , i was already interested in animals and plants .
even back then i wanted to be a natural scientist .
and my parents were great in supporting me .
i was always in the garden or forest and always had my eyes on the ground because i was looking for plants and animals .
but i also find chemistry and physics interesting , in addition to biology . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .

then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .
i did that because i felt they had supported me well and i wanted to show how grateful i was . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at first i was quite speechless and , to be completely honest , tears even came to my eyes .
i could hardly believe it .
and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ?
the world was suddenly different because a nobel prize can be viewed as the crowning achievement in the life of a scientist .
and the fact that is was awarded to me on my birthday – well , i ca n't imagine anything nicer .
are there negative implications as well ?
none other than that my meetings were turned upside down from one day to the next .

are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?

in my time it was still an absolutely descriptive science .
we called it the counting bug legs science .
but today , in my opinion , molecular biology is much more promising than the classic natural sciences .
but musicology could interest me as well .
music in any case .
i love to play piano and the harpsichord .

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .

prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

she told dw about her post-nobel duties and her love for the outdoors . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1995 ?
christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .
how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize ?
it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .
the prize also gave developmental biology some momentum , thrusting it into the spotlight .
does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .
for example , conveying science to the public , taking part in ethics committees , advising , being on many boards and writing reports .
so at the time i suffered a little bit .
at first everyone was very excited and then a big wave of envy came and then i received all of these responsibilities and if you say no , people say that you have no sense of responsibility .
but i always tried to do my duty .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was n't gifted when it came to languages .
i mostly copied in latin and in english i was often on the verge of a five -lrb- the lowest grade - eds . -rrb- . but i was often an only student in art and music .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
i actually do n't want to research in any other discipline .
my siblings all studied art or architecture .
but as a child , i was already interested in animals and plants .
even back then i wanted to be a natural scientist .
and my parents were great in supporting me .
i was always in the garden or forest and always had my eyes on the ground because i was looking for plants and animals .
but i also find chemistry and physics interesting , in addition to biology . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2008 eu leaders agree to guarantee private bank deposits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been an agonizing time on stock exchanges as shares seesaw european stock markets continued to slide in volatile trade tuesday as finance ministers from across the continent unified to urge greater measures to secure private bank deposits in the european union . at a regular meeting in luxembourg , the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states agreed in principle that their countries should each , as a minimum , guarantee private bank deposits to a level of " at least " 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- " for at least one year , " diplomats said . the minimum deposit guarantee currently stands at 20,000 euros . however , individual member states are free to set higher figures , the ministers agreed , acknowledging that " many member states are determined " to raise the limit to 100,000 euros . the political agreement will only become law once the eu 's executive , the european commission , makes a binding legal proposal which member states formally approve . " we have agreed to support systemic financial institutions , " deputy german finance minister joerg asmussen told reporters after the luxembourg talks . eu markets continue spiral bad financial news continued to pile up in europe despite the last-minute rescue late sunday of one of germany 's most important banking institutions , commercial property lender hypo real estate .
markets in frankfurt , london and paris continued their downward spiral on tuesday with investors continuing to worry over the strength of financial institutions .
frankfurt stocks fell back into the red midmorning on tuesday as a rebound from steep losses on monday ran out of steam amid fresh worries that german banks would fall victim to the financial crisis .
on monday , the dax plunged more than seven percent in line with markets around the world .
london 's ftse 100 surrendered early gains as banking shares took a hammering .
the royal bank of scotland was the biggest loser , with its shares down more than 30 percent to a 13-year low .
france 's cac-40 index also followed the same trend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian stock markets also plunged sharply this week japan 's nikkei 225 index sank more than 5 percent - below the 10,000-point barrier - before recovering slightly to close down 3 percent .
however australia 's financial markets rallied after the country 's central bank cut its official interest rate from 7 percent to 6 percent .
iceland passes emergency powers over banks iceland agreed to adopt sweeping powers over banks as its currency plunged 30 percent and a leading agency cut its credit ratings .
on tuesday , financial authorities took over the country 's second largest bank , landesbanki in a bid to stave off national bankruptcy after its banks took on massive debts in expanding overseas .
" as declared by the government , all domestic deposits are fully guaranteed .
landsbanki 's domestic branches , call centers.cash machines -lrb- atms -rrb- and internet operations will be open for business as usual , " the icelandic financial supervisory authority said in a statement .
eu criticized for piecemeal response the eu has been criticised for its fragmented response to the crisis and the way individual countries have broken ranks with deposit guarantees .
" we need to find a common solution as one country 's solution may be another country 's problem , " said swedish finance minister anders borg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , with french president sarkozy and british premier brown but german chancellor angel merkel continued to oppose a european fund to rescue struggling banks , saying that each country needed to " face up to its own responsibility . " merkel pointed out that the government stepped in this weekend with a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bailout of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth-largest bank .
but germany wants to avoid being stuck with a massive bill for the bailout of other countries ' failed financial institutions .
instead , merkel continues to call for tighter market controls over the banking sector .
a common pledge while there is no agreement on a bailout , european leaders vowed they would " continue to take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors , ” according to a joint statement read monday by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" european leaders acknowledge the need for close coordination and cooperation , " sarkozy said .
eu countries have not found common ground on whether to guarantee all money in bank deposits .
ireland and greece moved last week to pass a law which guaranteed all bank deposits .
while germany initially opposed the idea , it seemed poised to change course sunday when merkel offered a " political pledge " guaranteeing money in german banks . denmark , portugal and iceland guaranteed deposits monday and austria , britain , denmark , france , portugal , sweden have announced similar plans are under discussion .
merkel promises clarification merkel 's assurance sunday that all deposits in german banks are secure has not been followed up with specific policy proposals on how the estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- in savings accounts would be protected .

" i ca n't see defense is going to escape any kind of austerity measures , " said defense economist mark stoker from the london institute , as quoted by reuters .
" it would be very difficult for any government to justify cutting health and education in favour of , say , building two aircraft carriers and buying a load of planes to stick on them . "
military spending budgets for iraq and afghanistan would likely escape any re-rationalization as a result of global financial strains , the analysts also said .
" there would n't be an appetite to cut back on the pursuit of an important objective to the united states in the name of near-term economic gain , " said lieutenant-colonel nathan freier of the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington , reuters reported .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can eu leaders work together for the defence of europe ?
and with hundreds of billions of euros being wielded by european states to prop up flailing financial institutions and with excess budgets a possible rarity in the short-term , eu countries may be pushed into tighter military union in an effort to avoid duplication of the 27-member bloc 's limited resources .
governmental bail-outs were announced tuesday , sept .
29 , for key banks in britain , the benelux countries and germany as well as a state takeover of a bank in iceland .
french defense minister herve morin , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said last week that the current crisis showed the need for greater european military and defense cooperation .
morin and french president nicolas sarkozy have been pushing for a boost in europe 's defensive capabilities , insisting wednesday , oct .
1 , that the financial crisis was creating a " new equilibrium " in world power .
" we must learn the consequences for us , europeans , that there are a certain number of things that can not be solved at the national level , " morin said before the start of an informal meeting with eu counterparts .
russia steps up spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's military spending is set to hit $ 58 billion by 2011 further confusing the issue of the defense of europe for eu states was news tuesday that the kremlin would boost its own defense spending by 25 percent next year , raising the figure from $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion .
although moscow 's military budget remains roughly a tenth of that of the us for 2008 , the west nonetheless harbours fears of a resurgent russia , particularly in light of its august war with georgia which saw russian troops overwhelm the small caucasus nation and recognize two breakaway georgian enclaves as independent states .
only venezuela followed moscow 's lead in recognizing the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
having emerged as an energy superpower , russia has drawn europe into near dependence on its resources , another sticking point in relations between the eu and moscow . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lower house of parliament is scheduled to debate the cabinet decision later in the day .
a vote is not due until mid-october , but the measure is expected easily to pass in the legislature , where merkel 's broad-based coalition enjoys a secure majority .
the move came a day after the german defense ministry confirmed it will no longer make troops from its elite ksk special forces available to support us-led counterterrorism operations in the region called " operation enduring freedom " -lrb- oef -rrb- .
oef was a direct response to the sept .

steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge merkel in next year 's general election , noted that the ksk soldiers had not been deployed over the past three years .
steinmeier said berlin needed to keep its focus on the nato-led isaf troops in afghanistan .

the a sample of the 27-year-old german , who was to join the belgian quick step team in the new year , returned a positive result for cera -lrb- continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator -rrb- after a new test .
holczer said he has immediately suspended schumacher from the team .
schumacher won the two time trials during this year 's tour de france and wore the yellow jersey of the overall leader for two days .
" we were cheated .
i will use the last cent in my pocket to take legal steps against him .
i had no suspicions , " he said , adding that schumacher has already been tested 13 times this year by the sport 's controlling body uci .
the french sports paper l 'equipe reported monday on its web site that schumacher only tested positive for cera after a combination of two tests was conducted on a blood sample .
saunier duval rider leornardo piepoli also tested positive and will have to attend an italian olympic committee hearing on friday .
his team-mate riccardo ricco , who already tested positive during the tour and has received a two-year ban , is said to have also tested positive again with the new testing methods .
the re-tests for cera were conducted on riders who returned abnormally high blood readings during the tour .
schumacher 's team- and room-mate austrian berhard kohl , who finished third in this year 's tour , told austrian journalists that he did not want to comment on the case .
" i spoke to stefan on the phone today and he should really be the first one to hear of these matters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 07.10.2008 eu leaders agree to guarantee private bank deposits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been an agonizing time on stock exchanges as shares seesaw european stock markets continued to slide in volatile trade tuesday as finance ministers from across the continent unified to urge greater measures to secure private bank deposits in the european union . at a regular meeting in luxembourg , the finance ministers of the eu 's 27 member states agreed in principle that their countries should each , as a minimum , guarantee private bank deposits to a level of " at least " 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- " for at least one year , " diplomats said . the minimum deposit guarantee currently stands at 20,000 euros . however , individual member states are free to set higher figures , the ministers agreed , acknowledging that " many member states are determined " to raise the limit to 100,000 euros . the political agreement will only become law once the eu 's executive , the european commission , makes a binding legal proposal which member states formally approve . " we have agreed to support systemic financial institutions , " deputy german finance minister joerg asmussen told reporters after the luxembourg talks . eu markets continue spiral bad financial news continued to pile up in europe despite the last-minute rescue late sunday of one of germany 's most important banking institutions , commercial property lender hypo real estate .
markets in frankfurt , london and paris continued their downward spiral on tuesday with investors continuing to worry over the strength of financial institutions .
frankfurt stocks fell back into the red midmorning on tuesday as a rebound from steep losses on monday ran out of steam amid fresh worries that german banks would fall victim to the financial crisis .
on monday , the dax plunged more than seven percent in line with markets around the world .
london 's ftse 100 surrendered early gains as banking shares took a hammering .
the royal bank of scotland was the biggest loser , with its shares down more than 30 percent to a 13-year low .
france 's cac-40 index also followed the same trend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian stock markets also plunged sharply this week japan 's nikkei 225 index sank more than 5 percent - below the 10,000-point barrier - before recovering slightly to close down 3 percent .
however australia 's financial markets rallied after the country 's central bank cut its official interest rate from 7 percent to 6 percent .
iceland passes emergency powers over banks iceland agreed to adopt sweeping powers over banks as its currency plunged 30 percent and a leading agency cut its credit ratings .
on tuesday , financial authorities took over the country 's second largest bank , landesbanki in a bid to stave off national bankruptcy after its banks took on massive debts in expanding overseas .
" as declared by the government , all domestic deposits are fully guaranteed .
landsbanki 's domestic branches , call centers.cash machines -lrb- atms -rrb- and internet operations will be open for business as usual , " the icelandic financial supervisory authority said in a statement .
eu criticized for piecemeal response the eu has been criticised for its fragmented response to the crisis and the way individual countries have broken ranks with deposit guarantees .
" we need to find a common solution as one country 's solution may be another country 's problem , " said swedish finance minister anders borg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , with french president sarkozy and british premier brown but german chancellor angel merkel continued to oppose a european fund to rescue struggling banks , saying that each country needed to " face up to its own responsibility . " merkel pointed out that the government stepped in this weekend with a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bailout of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth-largest bank .
but germany wants to avoid being stuck with a massive bill for the bailout of other countries ' failed financial institutions .
instead , merkel continues to call for tighter market controls over the banking sector .
a common pledge while there is no agreement on a bailout , european leaders vowed they would " continue to take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors , ” according to a joint statement read monday by french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" european leaders acknowledge the need for close coordination and cooperation , " sarkozy said .
eu countries have not found common ground on whether to guarantee all money in bank deposits .
ireland and greece moved last week to pass a law which guaranteed all bank deposits .
while germany initially opposed the idea , it seemed poised to change course sunday when merkel offered a " political pledge " guaranteeing money in german banks . denmark , portugal and iceland guaranteed deposits monday and austria , britain , denmark , france , portugal , sweden have announced similar plans are under discussion .
merkel promises clarification merkel 's assurance sunday that all deposits in german banks are secure has not been followed up with specific policy proposals on how the estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- in savings accounts would be protected .
merkel is scheduled address the issue when she speaks to parliament tuesday afternoon .

but that has n't stopped the team 's general manger from promising to keep klinsi on board . despite fans carrying banners reading " ami go home " in reference to klinsmann 's recent move from california to bavaria , bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said the former germany coach would be at bayern until - at least - the end of the season . " we are convinced by juergen and his philosophy , " he told the mass-market bild on tuesday , oct .
7 .
" he is the right coach for us .
he is doing everything right in general , only the results are not the right ones . " still , criticism and calls for klinsmann 's head been mounting in bavaria and beyond as the defending league champions currently languishing in 11th place after lackluster bundesliga performances .
with just two wins in seven chances , the team is off to its worst season start in 31 years and seven points behind frontrunners hamburg . squandered opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's franck ribery , right , is n't the only one who has looked bad on the pitch for munich bayern threw away a 3-1 lead in the final six minutes on saturday in a 3-3 draw with vfl bochum which prompted angry reactions from the fans .
doubts have also been raised over klinsmann 's rotation schemes as well as his benching of captain mark van bommel in recent games . the german press , much of which seems pleased at the chance to watch perennial favorites bayern struggle , have heaped criticism upon bayern in general and klinsmann in particular . " there does n't seem to be a clear line at bayern - it 's more of a zigzag course , " kicker sports magazine wrote .
the daily tagesspiegl was more even more direct , " klinsmann does n't actually have any time left , because every week he 's losing points and no one can see what he wants . " even bayern stalwart and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has expressed thinly veiled doubts about klinsi 's coaching style , which has reportedly included adding buddha statues to the locker room and " the myth that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break , " german soccer 's kaiser wrote in his bild column .
" the league senses that we are vulnerable at the moment . rummenigge : fans should toughen up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said bayern will have something to celebrate this season but it 's in the face of vulnerability that munich 's supporters have to show they 're more than fair-weather fans , chairman rummenigge has said . " bayern - including their fans - must prove this season whether they are only stable in the case of success or whether we have the patience and the trust to embark on a new path , " said rummenigge . klinsmann , seen by some as overly optimistic , said the team is still within reach of all its goals . though their performances have been less than awe-inspiring , bayern lead their group in the champions league , are in the next round of the german cup and while struggling in the german league still have time to turn themselves around . klinsmann promised the bild that there would be celebrations in munich at the end of the season . " i am a fighter and an optimist , " the 44-year-old said .
" there are always difficult stages , but in the end there were always celebrations and satisfaction .
it will be the same this time around . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she told dw about her post-nobel duties and her love for the outdoors . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1995 ?
christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .
how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize ?
it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .
the prize also gave developmental biology some momentum , thrusting it into the spotlight .
does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .
for example , conveying science to the public , taking part in ethics committees , advising , being on many boards and writing reports .
so at the time i suffered a little bit .
at first everyone was very excited and then a big wave of envy came and then i received all of these responsibilities and if you say no , people say that you have no sense of responsibility .
but i always tried to do my duty .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was n't gifted when it came to languages .
i mostly copied in latin and in english i was often on the verge of a five -lrb- the lowest grade - eds . -rrb- . but i was often an only student in art and music .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
i actually do n't want to research in any other discipline .
my siblings all studied art or architecture .
but as a child , i was already interested in animals and plants .
even back then i wanted to be a natural scientist .
and my parents were great in supporting me .
i was always in the garden or forest and always had my eyes on the ground because i was looking for plants and animals .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech . " we think that with this guarantee ... the objective is being fulfilled , namely a calming of the situation , " steg told a regular news conference . " taking into account everything that we have seen before and particularly after the statement , from banking sources as well as from what we are reading ... and what we are hearing in terms of reactions from other countries in europe and the wider world , we were dead right with this decision , " steg said . the comments came as european finance ministers agreed in luxembourg on tuesday to increase minimum bank deposit guarantees in europe to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,500 -rrb- from 20,000 euros currently . guaranteeing private deposits is aimed at preventing a rush of people seeking to withdraw all their money from banks because of fears that the bank could fold .
such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .

7 for better arrangements to avert future crises in the financial sector as german politicians took sides over her pledge to protect the country 's savings . a new system needed to be developed involving all major players in the sector , she said in an address to parliament on the banking crisis which has engulfed europe . describing the global financial crisis as unprecedented , merkel said it had confirmed many people 's suspicions of greed and irresponsible speculation . " the situation is serious , " the chancellor said .
" confidence , the most important currency of the financial markets , has been lost . ...
it is vitally important to restore confidence . " in order to achieve this , stricter international rules were needed for the financial sector , including short-term measures that would help stabilize the situation , she said . in this context she defended this week 's 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- bail-out for troubled german mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . if her government had not acted when it did , she said , the situation could have become far more serious and spread to other financial sectors . the bank , which mainly lends to commercial projects and builders of public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the credit crunch that has spread from new york in the last month . hre fell into crisis after its dublin-based subsidiary depfa ran out of cash .
its difficulties prompted merkel to guarantee all savings deposits in germany , a pledge she repeated to parliament . merkel said that the german economy was " strong " and that she was confident it would be able to cope with the consequences of the global financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world remain volatile " -lrb- the -rrb- long term consequences of the financial crisis are today impossible to foresee , as are the effects on our growth and our country , " merkel said .
" but i say too , also in this difficult hour , that germany is strong ... and i am firmly convinced that this will help us to cope with the consequences of the financial crisis , even if it will not be easy . " merkel welcomed a commitment by european union governments to rescue failing banks in their countries that could affect other nations .
" we must be able to rely on that in europe , " she told parliament .
" of course we need coherent , common action . ” eu , ireland come under fire however , she also pointed to european divisions over wider-ranging efforts to stem problems on the continent and reiterated germany 's opposition to the idea of a joint european union fund to rescue troubled banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is against an eu-wide protective umbrella " another option that germany believes to be unacceptable is that 27 eu member countries open up an umbrella and pay into a joint fund , " she said . merkel also criticized ireland 's unilateral move to protect its banks as " unacceptable " , saying dublin had not gone about the decision in the right way . " the irish way is not the right way , " merkel said .
" protecting without coordination one 's own banks , without including other international institutions that paid taxes in ireland for years , and thereby of course hurting competition , is in my opinion unacceptable . " ireland pledged a blanket guarantee on personal and corporate bank deposits at its six major banks last week despite protests by neighbors that it would distort competition . in dublin , irish prime minister brian cowen 's office declined to comment on merkel 's remarks . the chancellor also called for executives to be called into account for their actions if their banks run into trouble . in this context , she attacked the payment of large bonuses for short-term gains .
executive remuneration should be based on long-term performance , she said . merkel also called for new regulations to deal with rating agencies , whom she said played a major role in falsely estimating the value of bank assets , thus contributing to the current crisis . merkel 's address came at a time of conflict within the government over germany ’ s pledge to guarantee more than 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1,359 billion -rrb- in private savings as it struggles to tackle the global financial crisis . government split over legality of merkel 's plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck believes the guarantee plan is above board a number of opposition lawmakers clashed members of the ruling coalition tuesday over claims that german law says the government can only make such guarantees with parliamentary approval . " if the government is serious then it must also give the so-called guarantee a serious framework , " otto fricke - a member of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and chairman of the lower house budget committee - said , adding that this could include a supplementary budget . " the bundestag -lrb- lower house -rrb- must really give its support , " christine scheel , deputy head of the greens parliamentary group , said of the savings guarantee .
if the government ever had to follow through on its pledge , a supplementary budget would be necessary , she said . the german finance ministry initially estimated the guarantee covered around 563 billion euros -lrb- $ 764.8 billion -rrb- in private savings accounts , but has since said that additional private money in checking and time deposit accounts would bring the total to over 1 trillion euros . figures from the german banks association -lrb- bdb -rrb- suggest it could be even higher , around 1.6 trillion . guarantee soothes worries , says government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is guarding its money well , sources say however , merkel 's announcement of guarantee for all savings in germany , made at a hastily arranged news conference with finance minister peer steinbrueck on sunday in berlin , has achieved its aim of soothing people 's worries about their money not being safe , government spokesman thomas steg told reporters ahead of the chancellor ’ s speech .

such a run on a bank , as it called , threatens its collapse . steg said the guarantee , announced by merkel on sunday as the government was struggling to put together a last-ditch rescue package for mortgage lender hypo real estate , was a " political guarantee " and not an intention to change the law . this raised eyebrows in europe - and prompted british prime minister gordon brown to seek clarification from merkel - but steg said the fact that the guarantee had worked meant that it did not have to hit the statute book . a spokesman for the german finance ministry added that so far , no large movement of money had been noted since merkel 's announcement , for example from equity funds into savings accounts covered by the new guarantee . the ministry estimates the value of the guaranteed accounts at well over one trillion euros - more than half of germany 's annual economic output . germany 's announcement of a deposit guarantee followed a similar , but more far-reaching move by ireland last week .
berlin 's action prompted other countries to say that they planned to follow suit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she told dw about her post-nobel duties and her love for the outdoors . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize in 1995 ?
christiane nuesslein-volhard : i got the call from stockholm at around 11:00 a.m. when i was at the institute .
of course it was very surprising , even though i did n't fall off my chair .
and i was truly happy once i learned that i would be sharing the prize with my long-time colleague and my very good friend eric wieschaus .
how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize ?
it was a wonderful thing .
the notoriety that one gains in winning the prize is great .
the prize also gave developmental biology some momentum , thrusting it into the spotlight .
does the nobel prize have negative implications as well ?
life is more difficult after because , although my job is already a work-intensive profession that is exerting in any case , i had to take on even more duties .
for example , conveying science to the public , taking part in ethics committees , advising , being on many boards and writing reports .
so at the time i suffered a little bit .
at first everyone was very excited and then a big wave of envy came and then i received all of these responsibilities and if you say no , people say that you have no sense of responsibility .
but i always tried to do my duty .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was n't gifted when it came to languages .
i mostly copied in latin and in english i was often on the verge of a five -lrb- the lowest grade - eds . -rrb- . but i was often an only student in art and music .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
i actually do n't want to research in any other discipline .
my siblings all studied art or architecture .
but as a child , i was already interested in animals and plants .
even back then i wanted to be a natural scientist .
and my parents were great in supporting me .
i was always in the garden or forest and always had my eyes on the ground because i was looking for plants and animals .
but i also find chemistry and physics interesting , in addition to biology . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw about the artistic side of his field , his interest in music and life after nobel . deutsche welle : where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your 2007 nobel prize ?
gerhard ertl : i got a call at my office from sweden at 11:30 in the morning .
at first i was quite speechless and , to be completely honest , tears even came to my eyes .
i could hardly believe it .
and how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ?
the world was suddenly different because a nobel prize can be viewed as the crowning achievement in the life of a scientist .
and the fact that is was awarded to me on my birthday – well , i ca n't imagine anything nicer .
are there negative implications as well ?
none other than that my meetings were turned upside down from one day to the next .
all hell broke loose , but i enjoyed it .
which subject did you dislike in school ?
i was a dud in sports – and i still am today .
are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ?
today i would probably choose biology .
in my time it was still an absolutely descriptive science .
we called it the counting bug legs science .
but today , in my opinion , molecular biology is much more promising than the classic natural sciences .
but musicology could interest me as well .
music in any case .
i love to play piano and the harpsichord .
i see many links between chemistry and music .
a lot of researchers have a similar disposition to artists .
and a beautiful paradigm or a nice formula always gives me aesthetic pleasure . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw talked to him about his economic ideas for the future and his dislike for a particular sport from the united states . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? george a. akerlof : let me name three main challenges .
the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .
this is a challenge we have to meet and we have to pay the price , which is a large price .
i think in order to do that we can do better if we use good economics for getting that solution . can the world still be saved ? i think the world can still be saved .
but i think it 's going to take some leadership .
i think we need a leadership from all parts of the world .
we need leadership from europe , we need leadership from america and we need leadership especially from the very large developing countries .
what they need to do is get people into the room , and then they need to simply agree how to handle this as a problem . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i personally work on economic research - that is what i do .
and i think it 's very important to have good economics and i feel that the bad economic decisions can cost people a lot .
if we have the right views about economics the world can be a lot better off . which subject did you dislike in school ? i am not sure if there is any subject in school that i did n't like at all .
i found it all interesting . what about sports ? well , there were some sports i did n't like .
i was n't good in football .
football in america means american football , not european football . are there any other disciplines in which you would like to do some research ? sociology .
actually , i am doing work that is on the cusp of economics , sociology and psychology .
so , what i am doing now is sort of indistinguishable . where were you and what were you doing when you heard about your nobel prize ? i can remember that i was asleep and i certainly was n't expecting it .
the telephone rang at 6:15 in the morning .
then they told me that i had won the nobel prize . and what happened then ? i got up and within a matter of minutes the tv station was there and inside the house . how have you personally benefited from the nobel prize since then ? i think i have done things that i would n't have otherwise done .
as president of the american economic association , i think i have given a lot of talks .
i think i have been a little bit involved in politics and it 's been a lot of fun . are there negative implications as well ? i do n't think so , no .
i am working a little bit harder , but , since i am enjoying it a lot , i would say that is all positive . what did you do with the prize money ? after deduction from expenses and taxes i gave the prize money to the university of california berkeley .
i did that because i felt they had supported me well and i wanted to show how grateful i was . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the first thing is public global warming .
i think we should deal with global warming .
the second main challenge is poverty in a very large fraction of the world .
i think , gradually or even fairly quickly , that is being cured in india and china and brazil .
the challenge is to keep that going .
the third challenge is the continued presence of wars .
we have to be pacifists .
that should be something that is taught to everybody , everywhere . what are your solutions on these issues ? i feel that we have the solutions for global warming , but that it 's going to be very expensive to solve .
but in fact , we seem to be technologically able to have alternative forms of energy .
it seems to me that what we now need is the commitment - particularly of the developed world .

mcfadden talks about balancing his research and charity work and his efforts to stay cool in the media spotlight . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges facing mankind at the moment ? daniel mcfadden : i think the primary challenge is governance at a global level because globalization and economics make it particularly important to be able to manage global markets and regulate them , so that the products are safe and contact of businesses is sound .
that requires a need for regulation and legal recourse , legal systems for settling disputes at a global level .
i would say establishing that is the biggest challenge . what is your solution for that ? if i only knew ...
one could hope that international organizations like the un could be revitalized .
that will take the will of major powers that are currently very protective of their own rights .
i think there is a need for the citizens of particular countries , like the us , to be more aware that we all are on one globe , and that we need to work together . can the world still be saved ? oh , i think the world will manage .
whether the human race will be part of it , of course , is a more interesting question for us .
for us to be saved , we have got to learn to be a little less unruly in our dealings with each other and to look for ways of living which are a little easier on the planet . how do you personally try to improve the world ? i 'm a great believer in trying to do good works .
i have various charities that i devote my surplus income to .
i think in the end a great deal of the benefit that we can do is individual and specific .
i 'm not trying to save the world - i 'm just trying to help a few people out . in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research beside economics ? i 've always had a deep interest in child psychology of choice behavior .
i continue to follow the developments in that field with great interest .
these days there are tremendous innovations in biology , some of which are actually quite relevant to economics .
i suppose if i were starting over i would do biology as part of my training . and which subject did you dislike in school ? actually i ca n't remember any subjects that i did n't like .
i know some teachers i did n't like , especially in mathematics where the teachers did n't like the way i did math . where and in which situation were you when you heard about your nobel prize ? i was in berkeley .
i got the call at 2:30 in the morning - i was sound asleep .
my wife jumped up and down and said that this is very exciting and i was trying to figure out what was going on . and what happened then ? it was quite a whirlwind .
within an hour i had an ap reporter in my bedroom and within two hours i had tv trucks lining the streets and neighbors coming out and asking who had been murdered . how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ? the prize offers you some responsibilities because you become a public spokesman for economics .
it offers you a great field for making a fool of yourself by speaking on topics which you should keep quiet about .
but it 's of course a very nice thing to have , but i would say primarily it makes you a public citizen . are there other negative implications ? it 's very hard to balance the public aspects of my life after this prize with my personal research , so it 's always a struggle trying to keep most of my week available for private work . what did you do with the prize money ? i put it in a charitable foundation and that 's being used for some education and art projects and museum support . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

spence revealed his optimistic prognosis for the world and how winning the prize changed his life . deutsche welle : what are the main challenges the world is facing ?
michael spence : we have a number of important challenges .
global warming , the rising pressure on natural resources , accommodating growth in developing countries and , when you take that list , what we really need , i think is progress in finding ways to deal with these on a kind of multinational basis - a really effective mechanism .
what is your solution ?
is it only this multinational institution you are talking about ?
no , there 's a lot of work to do on the domestic policy front .
but i do n't think anybody has a solution to that .
i think it 's going to take a lot of smart people , many of them are young , and a fair amount of time to redesign mechanisms for doing this .
it is a challenge .
can the world still be saved ?
oh , sure .
i 'm not pessimistic about this at all .
i think these are manageable challenges with wise and collective decision making about them .
prices provide very powerful incentives to change behavior and so far we are seeing that already .
so i 'm actually pretty optimistic , but there 's a big challenge ahead .
how do you personally try to improve the world , to make it better ?
in the last couple of years i 've spent my time as the chairman of a commission on growth and development .
so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

so i 've been focused on the developing world and its growth strategies and challenges and essentially trying to see the world through their eyes , because i think it 's an important perspective to have , if one is trying to bring together a larger group of important players into a discussion about managing the global economy .
in which other academic discipline would you like to do some research , other than economics , if you had the choice ?
i 'm probably a little too old for this , but there 's very exciting work being done by young people in political economy , a cross between political science and economics , that i think is terribly important .
if i were a little bit younger and had the creativity i 'd probably try to dive into that area .
and which subject at school did n't you like at all ?
you know there is n't an answer to that .
i ca n't think of anything i did n't like .
even sports ?
i grew up in canada , so i played ice hockey .
right up through college i played hockey for princeton university .
i love sports .
where were you when you received the news of your nobel prize ?
i was in hawaii .
i was in a different time zone by , i think , three hours .
so when the call came to california i was n't there .
and then some friend saw it go up on the web site , so somebody phoned me in the middle of the night .
it was a complete surprise .
and what happened then ?
then we stayed up and tried to figure out what you are supposed to do when this happens and then the press started calling .
how did you personally benefit from the nobel prize ?
you have to be a little careful .
people listen to you an awful lot .
and one of the best pieces of advice came from one of my colleagues .
this guy said , " mike , people are going to ask you questions about things you know absolutely nothing about and probably the best thing to say is ' i do n't know ! " '
are there other negative implications ?
no , i mean you become more visible and a slightly more public figure .
i do n't think of that as negative .
i think it carries some responsibilities , actually .
you 're expected to show up and try to be helpful .
i think that 's a small price to pay for an honor like this .
what did you do with the prize money ?
i am in the process of setting up a little foundation , a sort of fund for charitable purposes .
then i can use the income to support various causes . interview : marco vollmar -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the scheme helps people who can not afford to buy their own home outright get onto the property ladder .
earlier this year , the ni housing co-ownership association warned it did not have the budget to keep up with demand .
however , chief executive alan crowe said the fresh funding was " great news " for people applying to join the scheme .
" there will be a property cap of £ 175,000 just for these homes , removing them from the realm of stamp duty , which is advantageous for the cash-strapped buyer , " he said .
mr crowe said recent adjustments in the housing sector meant " more people can afford to come into the market at that level through co-ownership " .
earlier this year there were fears the scheme would not have the budget to keep up with demand , and the association had been unable to take in new applications for several months .
the fresh funding , which is in addition to the current year 's grant of £ 15m from the department for social development , was made available following negotiations with the bank of ireland .
social development minister margaret ritchie said : " this is excellent news for people trying to get onto the housing ladder .
" the funding will ensure that the association will deliver the programme for government 's target of 500 affordable houses this year . "

the scheme helps people who can not afford to buy their own home outright get onto the property ladder .
earlier this year , the ni housing co-ownership association warned it did not have the budget to keep up with demand .
however , chief executive alan crowe said the fresh funding was " great news " for people applying to join the scheme .
" there will be a property cap of £ 175,000 just for these homes , removing them from the realm of stamp duty , which is advantageous for the cash-strapped buyer , " he said .
mr crowe said recent adjustments in the housing sector meant " more people can afford to come into the market at that level through co-ownership " .
earlier this year there were fears the scheme would not have the budget to keep up with demand , and the association had been unable to take in new applications for several months .
the fresh funding , which is in addition to the current year 's grant of £ 15m from the department for social development , was made available following negotiations with the bank of ireland .
social development minister margaret ritchie said : " this is excellent news for people trying to get onto the housing ladder .
" the funding will ensure that the association will deliver the programme for government 's target of 500 affordable houses this year . "

the reserve bank of australia said that the sharp cut was justified given the prospects for growth , even though inflation is currently above target .
prime minister kevin rudd said the move would maintain financial stability and help australia in " tough times ahead " .
the cut , the bank 's largest since may 1992 , was well received by investors and the stock market rallied .
observers had only expected the rate to be cut to 6.5 % .
' big step ' the hefty reduction in the cost of borrowing came despite australian inflation being at 4.5 % - well above the government 's target of between 2 % and 3 % .
" they are clearly very concerned about the financial crisis and its potential impact on global growth , on asian economies which they specifically mention , and on commodity prices , " said saul eslake , chief economist with anz bank .
" i think it will be seen firstly as contributing to the health of the financial system and a big step to reducing the downside risks to economic growth , provided it is n't interpreted as panic . "
most banks were expected to begin pass on at least some of the rate cut to mortgage holders - with westpac lowering its variable rate by 80 basis points .
observers say that the move by australia adds to pressure on other central banks to reduce rates .
expectations are now growing that the bank of england will cut uk rates from their current level of 5 % later this week .

the reserve bank of australia said that the sharp cut was justified given the prospects for growth , even though inflation is currently above target .
prime minister kevin rudd said the move would maintain financial stability and help australia in " tough times ahead " .
the cut , the bank 's largest since may 1992 , was well received by investors and the stock market rallied .
observers had only expected the rate to be cut to 6.5 % .
' big step ' the hefty reduction in the cost of borrowing came despite australian inflation being at 4.5 % - well above the government 's target of between 2 % and 3 % .
" they are clearly very concerned about the financial crisis and its potential impact on global growth , on asian economies which they specifically mention , and on commodity prices , " said saul eslake , chief economist with anz bank .
" i think it will be seen firstly as contributing to the health of the financial system and a big step to reducing the downside risks to economic growth , provided it is n't interpreted as panic . "
most banks were expected to begin pass on at least some of the rate cut to mortgage holders - with westpac lowering its variable rate by 80 basis points .
observers say that the move by australia adds to pressure on other central banks to reduce rates .
expectations are now growing that the bank of england will cut uk rates from their current level of 5 % later this week .

the move comes as part of fresh plans to prevent radicalisation and address community concerns .
the 22 muslims aged 16-25 will hold regular meetings with key ministers and civil servants .
muslims called for a voice for youngsters in an official plan after the 2005 london suicide bombings which killed 52 people .
the advisory group comes as the government is rethinking how to prevent violent extremism , a key element of counter-terrorism strategy .
officials have acknowledged more work needs to be done to reach out into muslim communities .
the youth advisers are similar to another initiative which has seen muslim women directly advise ministers .
in contrast , the largest muslim umbrella body in the uk remains on the sidelines amid continuing rows with government .
ensuring young muslims have access to constructive , democratic channels for dealing with concerns and frustrations is crucial to our efforts to build strong , resilient communities hazel blears , communities secretary communities secretary hazel blears and schools secretary ed balls are unveiling 22 youth advisers who officials say have been drawn from a wide range of ethnic and social backgrounds .
they will be asked to give direct views to ministers on key issues including extremism , discrimination , citizenship and how they see islam fitting into british society .
in turn , officials hope they will take the dialogue with government back into communities .
the 22 have been partly chosen because of their track-records of community action and volunteering .
varied backgrounds one of the advisers , 18-year-old medical student aziza al yassin , said : " i hope to highlight the forgotten achievements of the muslim community in britain , as well as the areas where improvement is needed , not only with regards to tackling violence and extremism , but also in helping develop our mosques , education and interaction with the wider community .
" being a part of the link which is helping to address the lack of communication between muslims and the government , i can appreciate my role in identifying the issues which affect the british muslim community most , and how these can best be dealt with . "
more than 150 young people applied for positions on the group , with the final number chosen after a weekend of workshops and debates .
the advisers include students , undergraduates and a trainee lawyer .
ministers are understood to be prepared to have frank conversations with the advisors over foreign policy and other issues playing a role in terrorism recruitment .
but it is unclear if the final group includes anyone who holds political views which would be unpalatable for government .
' vital role ' critics of the strategy on preventing extremism believe officials have wasted time since 2005 talking to people with no influence over those most likely to be radicalised .
ms blears said : " there are over 800,000 muslims under the age of 25 living in the uk but we do n't hear enough from them .
" ensuring young muslims have access to constructive , democratic channels for dealing with concerns and frustrations is crucial to our efforts to build strong , resilient communities .

the move comes as part of fresh plans to prevent radicalisation and address community concerns .
the 22 muslims aged 16-25 will hold regular meetings with key ministers and civil servants .
muslims called for a voice for youngsters in an official plan after the 2005 london suicide bombings which killed 52 people .
the advisory group comes as the government is rethinking how to prevent violent extremism , a key element of counter-terrorism strategy .
officials have acknowledged more work needs to be done to reach out into muslim communities .
the youth advisers are similar to another initiative which has seen muslim women directly advise ministers .
in contrast , the largest muslim umbrella body in the uk remains on the sidelines amid continuing rows with government . "
ensuring young muslims have access to constructive , democratic channels for dealing with concerns and frustrations is crucial to our efforts to build strong , resilient communities " hazel blears , communities secretary communities secretary hazel blears and schools secretary ed balls are unveiling 22 youth advisers who officials say have been drawn from a wide range of ethnic and social backgrounds .
they will be asked to give direct views to ministers on key issues including extremism , discrimination , citizenship and how they see islam fitting into british society .
in turn , officials hope they will take the dialogue with government back into communities .
the 22 have been partly chosen because of their track-records of community action and volunteering .
varied backgrounds one of the advisers , 18-year-old medical student aziza al yassin , said : " i hope to highlight the forgotten achievements of the muslim community in britain , as well as the areas where improvement is needed , not only with regards to tackling violence and extremism , but also in helping develop our mosques , education and interaction with the wider community .

they are based on cathinone , the active ingredient in the plant khat , commonly used as a stimulant in east africa .
although cathinone is a controlled substance , scientists say these new compounds have been deliberately modified to circumvent the law .
expert john ramsey told the bbc : " presumably -lsb- users -rsb- think they 're safe , and they 're probably not . "
the new breed of drugs are being sold for between £ 3 and £ 6 a pill .
dance scene mr ramsey is director of tic tac communications based at st george 's hospital in south london .
he analyses the contents of legal high pills and other substances found in nightclub " drug amnesty " bins .
" the very latest ones we have seen are cathinones , " he said . "
these individuals present with clinical features that are very similar to established recreational drugs such as ecstasy , amphetamine , cocaine and ketamine " dr paul dargan guy 's and st thomas ' poisons unit " they are being sold as a safer alternative to ecstasy and i guess that there are a group of people who really want to engage with the dance scene and engage with their friends and do n't want to break the law .
" presumably they think they 're safe , and they 're probably not . "
there is a booming market for " legal high " drugs in the uk .
they are sold in so-called " head shops " that deal in drug paraphernalia , as well as at music festivals and over the internet .
it is not known how many of the pills are sold in the uk , but one recently disbanded website supplying them told drug researchers they were shipping more than 3,500 doses into the country every day .
most legal high pills are based on a group of drugs called piperazines , of which bzp is the most common .
these will be designated as controlled substances in the uk early next year under a european directive , but there is evidence that those who market them are already trying to avoid the attention of the law .
from the today programme more from today programme pills analysed at the tic tac laboratory , which were purchased from a uk-based website , were marked " bzp and piperazine-free " , but in fact when the contents were examined they were found to contain both substances .
and the latest discovery of cathinone-based pills suggests that manufacturers are aware of the coming changes to the law and are trying to find ways around it .
seizures doctors at guy 's and st thomas ' poisons unit have seen the effects that legal highs can have on some users .
dr paul dargan told the bbc : " these are individuals who present with clinical features that are very similar to established recreational drugs such as ecstasy , amphetamine , cocaine and ketamine . "
those clinical features can include rapid heart rate , raised blood pressure , high temperatures and seizures .
ahead of the classification of bzp , the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency said it was pursuing 12 cases involving piperazine-based pills .
