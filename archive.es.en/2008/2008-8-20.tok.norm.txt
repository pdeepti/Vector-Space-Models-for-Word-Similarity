" " as the world 's leading export nation and a key source of foreign investment , germany is heavily dependent on open markets , " said schnappauf , adding that foreign investment underpinned more than 2 million jobs in europe 's biggest economy . a report prepared by the investment house morgan stanley estimated that the state funds could already control up to $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- worldwide , building to $ 12 trillion by 2015 . last year , the chinese government acquired a 10-percent stake in the us private equity house blackstone , which has a key holding in german-based deutsche telekom ag , europe 's biggest phone company . this followed moves by russian state bank vtb to carve an interest in europe 's sensitive aeronautic and defense sector by seeking out a stake in the european aeronautic defense and space group -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is the parent company of the european aircraft maker airbus . hard to control ? at the same time , berlin has spearheaded a push to ensure greater transparency of the international hedge-fund industry , despite the reluctance of both britain and the us to take action to monitor the $ 1.4-trillion business . under the german government 's plans , investors would have to get approval from the government when purchasing more than 25 percent of a major german company .
the economics ministry will have up to three months to look at the purchase and an additional two months to decide whether to veto it . but analysts said that the risk is that foreign state funds could use groups based in other parts of the eu to move in on key german corporations . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .

20 . the decision by veteran jens lehmann to retire from the international game will at least usher in a new goalkeeping era for the losing euro 2008 finals . euro 2008 squad member adler , who injured his shoulder in pre-season training , looks the favorite to fill the gap now left by lehmann and his predecessor oliver kahn . hanover 's 30-year-old robert enke , who was number two behind lehmann at euro 2008 , will start the game to earn his second cap . with another promising keeper in schalke 's manuel neuer also injured , loew has now called up werder bremen 's tim wiese . " the match offers an opportunity to a few players who are not usually first choice , " loew told the dpa news agency on monday . " of course , i would like to have the whole team available but on the other hand we have the chance to try out something new . " loew will also have to change his midfield plans after captain michael ballack , torsten frings and jermaine jones all withdrew over the weekend with injuries , reducing the squad to 18 . " we will just have to share the duties , but no matter who is playing i want to see a fast-paced game , " loew said . captain ballack back on the physio 's table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack took a knock on saturday and withdrew ballack hobbled off in the first half of chelsea 's 4-0 win over portsmouth on sunday with a foot injury , while werder bremen 's frings has asked for more time to recover from a muscle problem . jones , who tore an ankle ligament playing for schalke on saturday , has been unfortunate with injuries just when it seemed he would break into the team .
he was in loew 's provisional party for euro 2008 but just missed the final cut for the 23-man squad . borussia moenchengladbach 's young striker marko marin was also discarded at the last moment before euro 2008 but is now back in the frame , while there could be a debut for stuttgart defender serdar tasci . it is the only chance loew has to look at the state of his team before the first world cup qualifier on sept .
6 , although the germans should be able to ease into the qualifying campaign at minnows liechtenstein in vaduz . four days later germans travel to finland before a first home game in group 4 against russia in dortmund on oct .
11 .
the other group opponents are wales and azerbaijan . " a game at this time of the season is always difficult but we have to try to get quickly into the season and the new competition , " loew said . jogi to learn from pain of spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres and spain taught germany a final lesson the coach 's chief aim now will be to learn the lessons of euro 2008 and the 1-0 defeat to spain in the final in order to ensure germany come through the world cup qualifying stage unscathed . " the defeat -lrb- to spain -rrb- is an incentive to work on a few things in the next two years , and also to develop and improve some aspects so that we qualify for the world cup in south africa , " he said . belgium visit with a couple of familiar faces to german fans in bayern munich defender daniel van buyten and moenchengladbach defender filip daems . belgium coach rene vandereycken has a total of 10 players in his 22-man squad who play in leagues outside belgium , including five in the dutch eredivisie and one each in the english premier league , italy 's serie a and the greek first division . germany , and west germany before it , have a strong record against belgium with 17 victories and only one defeat in 22 meetings .
the last between the two countries was in march 2004 when germany ran out 3-0 winners in cologne courtesy of goals from ballack , dietmar hamann and kevin kuranyi . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some attribute the minor increase to financial bonuses for children introduced last year . women in germany had an average of 1.37 children in 2007 , up from 1.33 in 2006 , said the federal statistical office on wednesday , aug .
20 .
some 685,000 babies were born in germany in 2007 , or 12,000 more than in the previous year . the slight jump - the first since 2004 - was good news in a country whose population is aging rapidly . in particular , births increased among women aged 33 to 37 , while they decreased among younger women . for the first time since german reunification in 1991 , women in eastern germany had as many children as those in western germany , according to the report .
the birth-rate in eastern germany had dropped sharply after reunification . some have attributed the higher birth rate to family allowances , which the government introduced in 2007 , which is an income-based sum paid out monthly for 12 to 14 months after a child 's birth .
it was originally designed to allow working women more flexibility in finding child care . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .
but maybe it just does not work any other way . bernd riegert is a european correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.08.2008 germany registers slight increase in birth rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , more cribs in german maternity wards were full for the first time in three years the birth rate in germany rose in 2007 for the first time in three years , according to new statistics .
some attribute the minor increase to financial bonuses for children introduced last year . women in germany had an average of 1.37 children in 2007 , up from 1.33 in 2006 , said the federal statistical office on wednesday , aug .
20 .

" the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory ... -lrb- while -rrb- the u.s. installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement , " said polish prime minister donald tusk , reuters reported .
" our countries , poland and the united states , will be more secure . " russia regards system as affront russia has fiercely opposed the missile shield , due to be operational by 2013 , saying it would respond by targeting its two former satellite states with a potential nuclear strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains in heated opposition to the us missile shield plans the decision by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " russian president dimitry medvedev told a joint press conference after a meeting in sochi on the black sea last friday , the international herald tribune reported .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent . " russia 's deputy chief of general staff , gen anatoly nogovitsyn , said last week the plans for the missile base in poland " could not go unpunished . " " it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation , the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia , " he said , according to the bbc . missile defense simply a safeguard , says rice rice , however , reiterated the missile shield is " purely defensive " and strengthens strategic cooperation with poland , a former soviet-bloc nation that was among the first to join nato after the cold war ended . " this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone , " she said .
" this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site ... that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long-range missile -lrb- attacks -rrb- from countries like iran or north korea . " we 're talking about a missile defense system that could n't possibly be aimed at the russian nuclear deterrent , " she told the bbc on tuesday .
" russia has thousands of nuclear warheads .
this is for small missile attacks of the kind that iran might launch . " shield accord signals new strength for poland , kaczynski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish leader lech kaczynski believes us shield has improved poland 's global position polish president lech kaczynski called the signing an " important day " in polish history during a televised address to the nation tuesday night . poland had taken a step to " strengthen its position in the world " by sealing the agreement with washington , he said . in july , the czech government agreed to host the system 's radar in a military area near the german border . approval by the czech and polish parliaments is required before the project can go ahead .
the system would represent the first us military bases in the two former warsaw pact nations . the us plan had been unpopular in both countries , but a recent poll showed polish opinion has swung in favor of the shield in the wake of the fighting over the breakaway region of south ossetia between russia and georgia . some 58 percent of poles canvassed said they now supported the pentagon 's plan . many poles view russia 's military incursion into georgia as proof that poland needs to bolster its defensive capabilities . dpa news ageny -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

any move toward formal independence is n't likely to sit well with tbilisi . abkhazia will hold a special parliamentary session on wednesday , aug .
20 , to consider an independence appeal to russia for recognition by the breakaway region 's president sergei bagapsh , abkhaz parliamentary speaker nugzar ashuba told interfax news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazia has its own flag " we will request to recognize the independence of our republic , " ashuba was quoted as saying . the speaker of russia 's upper house of parliament , sergei mironov , meanwhile said wednesday that russian lawmakers were " ready " to recognize the regions independence from georgia .
an emergency session would be held on monday to discuss the request , he added . " the council of federation is ready to recognize an independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia , if the peoples of the two republics want it and if there is a supporting decision of the president of russia , " mironov was quoted as saying in the southern russia city of vladikavkaz , where he visited refugees from the conflict in georgia 's other breakaway region of south ossetia . the decision by the council of federation , russia 's upper house of parliament , would have to be approved by president dmitry medvedev , said mironov .
however , medvedev has already promised support for any decision made by abkhazia or south ossetia . de facto independence russian troops on wednesday remained in the two breakaway regions , although medvedev has said that all but 500 soldiers would withdraw by the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakaway regions , shown in yellow , won de facto independence in the early 1990s both abkhazia and south ossetia have enjoyed de facto independence since winning a war of succession from georgia in the early 1990s .
they have since strengthened their ties with russia , though russia has not yet formally recognized their independence . most residents in the two separatist provinces have been issued russian passports in recent years , but while south ossetians would like to unite with the ethnically-linked russian region of north ossetia , abkhazia is lobbying to be recognized as an independent country . russian lawmakers gave voice to both independence movements in the wake of kosovo 's independence , claiming the cases could not be distinguished , and russia 's increasing support for the rebel regions in recent months was part of the flame that led to war with georgia in south ossetia last week . any formal move toward independence for abkhazia and south ossetia is likely to upset georgian president mikheil saakashvili , who promised during his election campaign to bring both regions under tbilisi 's control . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .

in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .

russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .

russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.08.2008 opinion : usa , eu must take russia seriously großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as nato 's ways of resolving the tense situation with russia over the georgian conflict look very limited , the west can not let up and must show russia it is being taken seriously , says dw 's bernd riegert . nato foreign ministers have to believe in the power of their words because , after all , they have no other means of asserting themselves against russia . political sanctions have to be excluded because no one wants to cut the only avenue of negotiations with moscow .
economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .
but maybe it just does not work any other way . bernd riegert is a european correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tension over the war in the caucasus has aggravated the west 's relations with moscow . russian president dmitry medvedev told his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation on tuesday , aug .
19 , that all but 500 russian troops would leave georgia by friday .
he had earlier promised the troop pullback would begin on monday . moscow and western leaders clashed at the united nations on tuesday when russia , which holds a veto power in the security council , refused to support a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops . the draft resolution , presented to the council by france , reaffirmed " the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said it would be " a waste of time " to put the resolution to a vote . cold war frame of mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote on the french resolution never came before the security council tension between moscow and western capitals grew earlier in the day at a nato summit where the alliance 's foreign minister clashed with russia over the recent conflict in would-be nato member georgia .
russia also accused nato of cold war thinking . nato " is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe ...
it 's time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw back to the status quo ante of august 6-7 , " before fighting in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia broke out , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a meeting with nato counterparts on tuesday . " what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled ? "
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer added , again referring to an eu-brokered cease-fire deal signed by dmitry medvedev on aug .
12 .
nato officials say russia is breaking the deal . at the emergency meeting , the foreign ministers of nato 's 26 member states agreed not to hold any more sessions of the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , which is the main platform for nato-russia dialogue , until russian troops pull out of georgia , and decided to create a new commission for dialogue with membership hopeful georgia . " russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role , as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution , " a joint statement after the meeting said .
" we can not continue with business as usual . " accusations fly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia accusses the us of aiding georgia 's campaign but russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , hit back strongly , accusing the us of helping georgia plan its attack on south ossetia , de hoop scheffer of acting as a us pawn and nato as a whole of keeping a cold war mentality . " today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war , it does n't matter what their propaganda says , " he said . " -lrb- georgian president mikhail -rrb- saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations , " he added , accusing nato of " turning a blind eye " to the destruction wrought by georgian forces on civilians in the breakaway province of south ossetia . " the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression ... and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies , " he said . russia can not cooperate with nato if it insists on " protecting criminals , " rogozin said . " if nato wants to cooperate with criminals , we ca n't stop them , but we can not cooperate anymore with an organization which works with criminals , " said rogozin , who compared saakashvili to hitler and saddam hussein . nato membership remains a hot topic in april , nato leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the alliance at an unspecified future point .
the alliance 's foreign ministers are set to discuss the issue further in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't tolerate georgia as a nato member but immediately after the decision , which russia criticized as a threat to its security , tensions between georgia and its breakaway provinces flared dramatically .
the tensions culminated in a georgian attack on south ossetia on aug .
7 and a russian military response which pushed well into georgian territory . french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who engaged in shuttle diplomacy to bring about a cease-fire , said tuesday that " if the european union had not moved , tbilisi would have been captured . " rogozin rejected that claim , saying that " russia 's actions were never intended to destroy , occupy or force regime change in georgia . " communication cut off by both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer put nato talks with russia on hold while de hoop scheffer said nato would not call any further nrc meetings until russia pulls its troops out of georgia , rogozin retorted that it would be up to nato to return to talks . " we will keep our very good bilateral contacts -lrb- with nato members -rrb- ... and hopefully there will be a better time sooner or later when nato understands that the world is very vulnerable and that bloc approaches are no longer possible , " he said . he also insisted that the row was not about to plumb the depths it saw during the cold war .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .

but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .

the biggest bible printing press in the world is in the eastern chinese city of nanjing .
anyone bringing bibles into the country is likely to encounter problems at customs however .
in china , the relationship between the state and the christian church remains tense .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
however , many of the estimated 60 to 100 million christians belong to so-called house churches , which are often referred to collectively as the “ underground ” church . the room is filled with the sound of music .
it sounds like a perfectly normal cultural event until one listens to the lyrics .
a christian service is beginning at a family church in beijing .
the prayers are accompanied by electric guitar and drums .
the church was founded about two years ago with the help of south korean missionaries .
it now has 500 members , who meet every sunday for a service in a rented conference room in the north of the chinese capital : one believer leads the others in prayer - they finish with “ amen ” .
then they discuss selected excerpts from the bible .
a young woman called cui climbs onto the podium and talks about her recently experiences volunteering in the earthquake zone .
she grew up in atheist china .
christianity has transformed her , she says : “ when god touches you , it changes your inner self in a magic way .
your former knowledge and experiences remain but your heart changes . ”
restrictive state-sanctioned religion although the right to religious freedom is firmly embedded in the chinese constitution , in practice only state-controlled forms of religious expression are allowed .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
the chinese protestant three-self patriotic movement and the china christian council form the official protestant church .
there is also the chinese patriotic catholic association , which is not recognised by rome .
the state-sanctioned churches ’ priests and bishops are nominated and paid by the state .
for this reason , many chinese christians feel that their religious freedom is restricted .
many catholics who remain loyal to the vatican or protestants who want to practise their religion more freely choose to join so-called house or family churches .
these are in theory illegal but usually tolerated .
however , the persecution of underground priests and believers continues .
in the run-up to the olympic games this year , 21 house pastors were sent to labour camps .
defending freedom of belief zhang kai is a member of the “ zion ” family church and a lawyer who represents believers , whose religious freedom rights have been violated : “ the heart of religious freedom lies in the separation of the church and the state , ” he explains .
“ a secular government should not venture into the territory of religion .
it also has no right to judge which religion is good or bad .
otherwise there is a violation of religious freedom and of the constitution , as well as the secular principle . ”
his most prominent case brought him to the province of zhejiang , where the local police had torn down the chapel of an underground church but in beijing he feels that the authorities are less brutal .
“ in june , the beijing police bureau in beijing banned an event .
they also wanted us to stop our services .
but the ban was unjustified and counter-constitutional .
since then the restrictions have been relaxed .
generally , the atmosphere is quite free at our church events . “ all believers are required by the police to register their personal details when they join a church .
but this does not seem to be stopping people from joining house churches such as the zion family church .
independent sources estimate the number of christians in china to lie between 60 and a hundred million .
the numbers are reportedly rising daily . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 20/08/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the biggest bible printing press in the world is in the eastern chinese city of nanjing .
anyone bringing bibles into the country is likely to encounter problems at customs however .
in china , the relationship between the state and the christian church remains tense .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
however , many of the estimated 60 to 100 million christians belong to so-called house churches , which are often referred to collectively as the “ underground ” church . the room is filled with the sound of music .
it sounds like a perfectly normal cultural event until one listens to the lyrics .
a christian service is beginning at a family church in beijing .
the prayers are accompanied by electric guitar and drums .
the church was founded about two years ago with the help of south korean missionaries .
it now has 500 members , who meet every sunday for a service in a rented conference room in the north of the chinese capital : one believer leads the others in prayer - they finish with “ amen ” .
then they discuss selected excerpts from the bible .
a young woman called cui climbs onto the podium and talks about her recently experiences volunteering in the earthquake zone .
she grew up in atheist china .
christianity has transformed her , she says : “ when god touches you , it changes your inner self in a magic way .
your former knowledge and experiences remain but your heart changes . ”
restrictive state-sanctioned religion although the right to religious freedom is firmly embedded in the chinese constitution , in practice only state-controlled forms of religious expression are allowed .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
the chinese protestant three-self patriotic movement and the china christian council form the official protestant church .
there is also the chinese patriotic catholic association , which is not recognised by rome .
the state-sanctioned churches ’ priests and bishops are nominated and paid by the state .
for this reason , many chinese christians feel that their religious freedom is restricted .
many catholics who remain loyal to the vatican or protestants who want to practise their religion more freely choose to join so-called house or family churches .
these are in theory illegal but usually tolerated .
however , the persecution of underground priests and believers continues .
in the run-up to the olympic games this year , 21 house pastors were sent to labour camps .
defending freedom of belief zhang kai is a member of the “ zion ” family church and a lawyer who represents believers , whose religious freedom rights have been violated : “ the heart of religious freedom lies in the separation of the church and the state , ” he explains .
“ a secular government should not venture into the territory of religion .
it also has no right to judge which religion is good or bad .
otherwise there is a violation of religious freedom and of the constitution , as well as the secular principle . ”
his most prominent case brought him to the province of zhejiang , where the local police had torn down the chapel of an underground church but in beijing he feels that the authorities are less brutal .
“ in june , the beijing police bureau in beijing banned an event .
they also wanted us to stop our services .
but the ban was unjustified and counter-constitutional .
since then the restrictions have been relaxed .
generally , the atmosphere is quite free at our church events . “ all believers are required by the police to register their personal details when they join a church .
but this does not seem to be stopping people from joining house churches such as the zion family church .
independent sources estimate the number of christians in china to lie between 60 and a hundred million .
the numbers are reportedly rising daily . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 20/08/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 05 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .
but maybe it just does not work any other way . bernd riegert is a european correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.08.2008 russia to back independence for abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has committed to support abkhazia and south ossetia georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia is reportedly set to lodge a formal appeal for moscow to recognize it as an independent state .
any move toward formal independence is n't likely to sit well with tbilisi . abkhazia will hold a special parliamentary session on wednesday , aug .
20 , to consider an independence appeal to russia for recognition by the breakaway region 's president sergei bagapsh , abkhaz parliamentary speaker nugzar ashuba told interfax news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazia has its own flag " we will request to recognize the independence of our republic , " ashuba was quoted as saying . the speaker of russia 's upper house of parliament , sergei mironov , meanwhile said wednesday that russian lawmakers were " ready " to recognize the regions independence from georgia .
an emergency session would be held on monday to discuss the request , he added . " the council of federation is ready to recognize an independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia , if the peoples of the two republics want it and if there is a supporting decision of the president of russia , " mironov was quoted as saying in the southern russia city of vladikavkaz , where he visited refugees from the conflict in georgia 's other breakaway region of south ossetia . the decision by the council of federation , russia 's upper house of parliament , would have to be approved by president dmitry medvedev , said mironov .
however , medvedev has already promised support for any decision made by abkhazia or south ossetia . de facto independence russian troops on wednesday remained in the two breakaway regions , although medvedev has said that all but 500 soldiers would withdraw by the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakaway regions , shown in yellow , won de facto independence in the early 1990s both abkhazia and south ossetia have enjoyed de facto independence since winning a war of succession from georgia in the early 1990s .
they have since strengthened their ties with russia , though russia has not yet formally recognized their independence . most residents in the two separatist provinces have been issued russian passports in recent years , but while south ossetians would like to unite with the ethnically-linked russian region of north ossetia , abkhazia is lobbying to be recognized as an independent country . russian lawmakers gave voice to both independence movements in the wake of kosovo 's independence , claiming the cases could not be distinguished , and russia 's increasing support for the rebel regions in recent months was part of the flame that led to war with georgia in south ossetia last week . any formal move toward independence for abkhazia and south ossetia is likely to upset georgian president mikheil saakashvili , who promised during his election campaign to bring both regions under tbilisi 's control . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , and still need parliamentary approval , will mean moves from non-european union controlled investment groups or companies to buy a stake of 25 percent or more in strategic parts of german industry can in future be blocked . " the majority of foreign investments wo n't be affected by the draft law , " said economy minister michael glos setting out details of the proposals .
" germany is and remains open to foreign investments . " public order and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is aimed at sensitive sectors such as the energy supply based on a us model , germany 's plans could lead to further attempts across the 27-member eu aimed at blocking foreign investment incursions into sensitive industries .
under germany 's proposals , " public order and security " the principal criteria for triggering a review of foreign groups ' investment plans . but berlin 's drive to enhance government regulation of the push by investment funds operated by foreign governments into corporate germany has set the alarm bells ringing in german business . " foreign investment brings many advantages such as economic growth , employment and as a result rising living standards , " said the general secretary of germany 's international chamber of commerce -lrb- icc -rrb- , angelika pohlenz . she said that the plan to regulate foreign investors could lead to lower foreign investment in germany and trigger limits on german investment in other parts of the world . wrong signal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders say germany should roll out the red carpet for investors the icc 's concerns were echoed across german business with the chief of the nation 's influential federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- , werner schnappauf saying berlin 's new laws sent " the wrong signal for germany as a place to invest . " " as the world 's leading export nation and a key source of foreign investment , germany is heavily dependent on open markets , " said schnappauf , adding that foreign investment underpinned more than 2 million jobs in europe 's biggest economy . a report prepared by the investment house morgan stanley estimated that the state funds could already control up to $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- worldwide , building to $ 12 trillion by 2015 . last year , the chinese government acquired a 10-percent stake in the us private equity house blackstone , which has a key holding in german-based deutsche telekom ag , europe 's biggest phone company . this followed moves by russian state bank vtb to carve an interest in europe 's sensitive aeronautic and defense sector by seeking out a stake in the european aeronautic defense and space group -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is the parent company of the european aircraft maker airbus . hard to control ? at the same time , berlin has spearheaded a push to ensure greater transparency of the international hedge-fund industry , despite the reluctance of both britain and the us to take action to monitor the $ 1.4-trillion business . under the german government 's plans , investors would have to get approval from the government when purchasing more than 25 percent of a major german company .
the economics ministry will have up to three months to look at the purchase and an additional two months to decide whether to veto it . but analysts said that the risk is that foreign state funds could use groups based in other parts of the eu to move in on key german corporations . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .
but maybe it just does not work any other way . bernd riegert is a european correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 . the decision by veteran jens lehmann to retire from the international game will at least usher in a new goalkeeping era for the losing euro 2008 finals . euro 2008 squad member adler , who injured his shoulder in pre-season training , looks the favorite to fill the gap now left by lehmann and his predecessor oliver kahn . hanover 's 30-year-old robert enke , who was number two behind lehmann at euro 2008 , will start the game to earn his second cap . with another promising keeper in schalke 's manuel neuer also injured , loew has now called up werder bremen 's tim wiese . " the match offers an opportunity to a few players who are not usually first choice , " loew told the dpa news agency on monday . " of course , i would like to have the whole team available but on the other hand we have the chance to try out something new . " loew will also have to change his midfield plans after captain michael ballack , torsten frings and jermaine jones all withdrew over the weekend with injuries , reducing the squad to 18 . " we will just have to share the duties , but no matter who is playing i want to see a fast-paced game , " loew said . captain ballack back on the physio 's table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack took a knock on saturday and withdrew ballack hobbled off in the first half of chelsea 's 4-0 win over portsmouth on sunday with a foot injury , while werder bremen 's frings has asked for more time to recover from a muscle problem . jones , who tore an ankle ligament playing for schalke on saturday , has been unfortunate with injuries just when it seemed he would break into the team .
he was in loew 's provisional party for euro 2008 but just missed the final cut for the 23-man squad . borussia moenchengladbach 's young striker marko marin was also discarded at the last moment before euro 2008 but is now back in the frame , while there could be a debut for stuttgart defender serdar tasci . it is the only chance loew has to look at the state of his team before the first world cup qualifier on sept .

the other group opponents are wales and azerbaijan . " a game at this time of the season is always difficult but we have to try to get quickly into the season and the new competition , " loew said . jogi to learn from pain of spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres and spain taught germany a final lesson the coach 's chief aim now will be to learn the lessons of euro 2008 and the 1-0 defeat to spain in the final in order to ensure germany come through the world cup qualifying stage unscathed . " the defeat -lrb- to spain -rrb- is an incentive to work on a few things in the next two years , and also to develop and improve some aspects so that we qualify for the world cup in south africa , " he said . belgium visit with a couple of familiar faces to german fans in bayern munich defender daniel van buyten and moenchengladbach defender filip daems . belgium coach rene vandereycken has a total of 10 players in his 22-man squad who play in leagues outside belgium , including five in the dutch eredivisie and one each in the english premier league , italy 's serie a and the greek first division . germany , and west germany before it , have a strong record against belgium with 17 victories and only one defeat in 22 meetings .

20 , and still need parliamentary approval , will mean moves from non-european union controlled investment groups or companies to buy a stake of 25 percent or more in strategic parts of german industry can in future be blocked . " the majority of foreign investments wo n't be affected by the draft law , " said economy minister michael glos setting out details of the proposals .
" germany is and remains open to foreign investments . " public order and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is aimed at sensitive sectors such as the energy supply based on a us model , germany 's plans could lead to further attempts across the 27-member eu aimed at blocking foreign investment incursions into sensitive industries .
under germany 's proposals , " public order and security " the principal criteria for triggering a review of foreign groups ' investment plans . but berlin 's drive to enhance government regulation of the push by investment funds operated by foreign governments into corporate germany has set the alarm bells ringing in german business . " foreign investment brings many advantages such as economic growth , employment and as a result rising living standards , " said the general secretary of germany 's international chamber of commerce -lrb- icc -rrb- , angelika pohlenz . she said that the plan to regulate foreign investors could lead to lower foreign investment in germany and trigger limits on german investment in other parts of the world . wrong signal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders say germany should roll out the red carpet for investors the icc 's concerns were echoed across german business with the chief of the nation 's influential federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- , werner schnappauf saying berlin 's new laws sent " the wrong signal for germany as a place to invest . " " as the world 's leading export nation and a key source of foreign investment , germany is heavily dependent on open markets , " said schnappauf , adding that foreign investment underpinned more than 2 million jobs in europe 's biggest economy . a report prepared by the investment house morgan stanley estimated that the state funds could already control up to $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- worldwide , building to $ 12 trillion by 2015 . last year , the chinese government acquired a 10-percent stake in the us private equity house blackstone , which has a key holding in german-based deutsche telekom ag , europe 's biggest phone company . this followed moves by russian state bank vtb to carve an interest in europe 's sensitive aeronautic and defense sector by seeking out a stake in the european aeronautic defense and space group -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is the parent company of the european aircraft maker airbus . hard to control ? at the same time , berlin has spearheaded a push to ensure greater transparency of the international hedge-fund industry , despite the reluctance of both britain and the us to take action to monitor the $ 1.4-trillion business . under the german government 's plans , investors would have to get approval from the government when purchasing more than 25 percent of a major german company .
the economics ministry will have up to three months to look at the purchase and an additional two months to decide whether to veto it . but analysts said that the risk is that foreign state funds could use groups based in other parts of the eu to move in on key german corporations . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tension over the war in the caucasus has aggravated the west 's relations with moscow . russian president dmitry medvedev told his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation on tuesday , aug .
19 , that all but 500 russian troops would leave georgia by friday .
he had earlier promised the troop pullback would begin on monday . moscow and western leaders clashed at the united nations on tuesday when russia , which holds a veto power in the security council , refused to support a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops . the draft resolution , presented to the council by france , reaffirmed " the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said it would be " a waste of time " to put the resolution to a vote . cold war frame of mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote on the french resolution never came before the security council tension between moscow and western capitals grew earlier in the day at a nato summit where the alliance 's foreign minister clashed with russia over the recent conflict in would-be nato member georgia .
russia also accused nato of cold war thinking . nato " is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe ...
it 's time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw back to the status quo ante of august 6-7 , " before fighting in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia broke out , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a meeting with nato counterparts on tuesday . " what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled ? "
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer added , again referring to an eu-brokered cease-fire deal signed by dmitry medvedev on aug .
12 .
nato officials say russia is breaking the deal . at the emergency meeting , the foreign ministers of nato 's 26 member states agreed not to hold any more sessions of the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , which is the main platform for nato-russia dialogue , until russian troops pull out of georgia , and decided to create a new commission for dialogue with membership hopeful georgia . " russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role , as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution , " a joint statement after the meeting said .
" we can not continue with business as usual . " accusations fly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia accusses the us of aiding georgia 's campaign but russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , hit back strongly , accusing the us of helping georgia plan its attack on south ossetia , de hoop scheffer of acting as a us pawn and nato as a whole of keeping a cold war mentality . " today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war , it does n't matter what their propaganda says , " he said . " -lrb- georgian president mikhail -rrb- saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations , " he added , accusing nato of " turning a blind eye " to the destruction wrought by georgian forces on civilians in the breakaway province of south ossetia . " the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression ... and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies , " he said . russia can not cooperate with nato if it insists on " protecting criminals , " rogozin said . " if nato wants to cooperate with criminals , we ca n't stop them , but we can not cooperate anymore with an organization which works with criminals , " said rogozin , who compared saakashvili to hitler and saddam hussein . nato membership remains a hot topic in april , nato leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the alliance at an unspecified future point .
the alliance 's foreign ministers are set to discuss the issue further in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't tolerate georgia as a nato member but immediately after the decision , which russia criticized as a threat to its security , tensions between georgia and its breakaway provinces flared dramatically .
the tensions culminated in a georgian attack on south ossetia on aug .
7 and a russian military response which pushed well into georgian territory . french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who engaged in shuttle diplomacy to bring about a cease-fire , said tuesday that " if the european union had not moved , tbilisi would have been captured . " rogozin rejected that claim , saying that " russia 's actions were never intended to destroy , occupy or force regime change in georgia . " communication cut off by both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer put nato talks with russia on hold while de hoop scheffer said nato would not call any further nrc meetings until russia pulls its troops out of georgia , rogozin retorted that it would be up to nato to return to talks . " we will keep our very good bilateral contacts -lrb- with nato members -rrb- ... and hopefully there will be a better time sooner or later when nato understands that the world is very vulnerable and that bloc approaches are no longer possible , " he said . he also insisted that the row was not about to plumb the depths it saw during the cold war . " it 's clear -lrb- russia 's relationship with nato -rrb- wo n't stay as it was before , there will be a lot of changes in the volume , quality and time-frame of our meetings , " he said .

it has a fleet of 65 jets .
it is a member of the star alliance network but recently proposed shedding almost a quarter of its 4,000 staff because of the fuel price rise crisis and reduced demand .
the airline posted net losses of 41 million euros -lrb- 62 million dollars -rrb- in the first quarter .
sas shares plunged 6.41 percent on the stockholm stock exchange after the crash .
sas had put spanair on the block earlier this year but announced in june that it was abandoning those plans due to the slowdown in the aviation sector . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .

in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .

russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .

russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .

russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .

he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .
konyushin , the russian ambassador , said russia was hoping the assembly would place the issue on the agenda in september . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.08.2008 opinion : usa , eu must take russia seriously großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as nato 's ways of resolving the tense situation with russia over the georgian conflict look very limited , the west can not let up and must show russia it is being taken seriously , says dw 's bernd riegert . nato foreign ministers have to believe in the power of their words because , after all , they have no other means of asserting themselves against russia . political sanctions have to be excluded because no one wants to cut the only avenue of negotiations with moscow .
economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .

but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .
but maybe it just does not work any other way . bernd riegert is a european correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory ... -lrb- while -rrb- the u.s. installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement , " said polish prime minister donald tusk , reuters reported .
" our countries , poland and the united states , will be more secure . " russia regards system as affront russia has fiercely opposed the missile shield , due to be operational by 2013 , saying it would respond by targeting its two former satellite states with a potential nuclear strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains in heated opposition to the us missile shield plans the decision by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " russian president dimitry medvedev told a joint press conference after a meeting in sochi on the black sea last friday , the international herald tribune reported .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent . " russia 's deputy chief of general staff , gen anatoly nogovitsyn , said last week the plans for the missile base in poland " could not go unpunished . " " it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation , the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia , " he said , according to the bbc . missile defense simply a safeguard , says rice rice , however , reiterated the missile shield is " purely defensive " and strengthens strategic cooperation with poland , a former soviet-bloc nation that was among the first to join nato after the cold war ended . " this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone , " she said .
" this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site ... that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long-range missile -lrb- attacks -rrb- from countries like iran or north korea . " we 're talking about a missile defense system that could n't possibly be aimed at the russian nuclear deterrent , " she told the bbc on tuesday .
" russia has thousands of nuclear warheads .
this is for small missile attacks of the kind that iran might launch . " shield accord signals new strength for poland , kaczynski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish leader lech kaczynski believes us shield has improved poland 's global position polish president lech kaczynski called the signing an " important day " in polish history during a televised address to the nation tuesday night . poland had taken a step to " strengthen its position in the world " by sealing the agreement with washington , he said . in july , the czech government agreed to host the system 's radar in a military area near the german border . approval by the czech and polish parliaments is required before the project can go ahead .
the system would represent the first us military bases in the two former warsaw pact nations . the us plan had been unpopular in both countries , but a recent poll showed polish opinion has swung in favor of the shield in the wake of the fighting over the breakaway region of south ossetia between russia and georgia . some 58 percent of poles canvassed said they now supported the pentagon 's plan . many poles view russia 's military incursion into georgia as proof that poland needs to bolster its defensive capabilities . dpa news ageny -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german strongman matthias steiner is putting his weight behind the anti-doping programs . over 4,000 doping tests have been carried out so far as part of the anti-doping program at the beijing games , the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said wednesday , aug .
20 . " we are now at a total of 4,133 tests of which 3,292 are urine and 848 are blood tests , " ioc communications director giselle davies told reporters .
" we 'll get to some 4,500 by the end of the games , the highest number of testing done in any olympic games as part of our efforts in the fight against doping . " the figure compares with 3,500 at the athens games four years ago and 2,800 at the 2000 sydney games . there have been a handful of positive tests so far , compared with a total 26 four years ago .
only one medal winner - shooter jong-su kim from north korea - has been stripped of his prize . heptathlon silver medallist lyudmila blonska , however , is under doping investigation at the beijing games , olympic sources told the dpa news agency on wednesday .
it was not known immediately for which substance the 29-year-old ukrainian tested positive .
if the positive test is confirmed she faces a life ban as a second-time offender . ahead of the games , ioc president jacques rogge said he expected 30 to 40 positive tests , based on results from previous olympics .
but davies insisted this year 's low numbers were an indication that doping deterrents were effective . natural strength german weightlifter matthias steiner , who won his first olympic gold medal this week , said he 'd been tested 10 times this year already and is a strong supporter of anti-doping efforts . " i certainly believe it 's a positive development , the fact that doping systems work and are effective , " the heavy-weight said tuesday , referring to the increased testing . performance-enhancing substances are particularly common in certain sports , including weightlifting , track and field , and cycling . bulgaria was forced to withdraw its weightlifting team from the games in beijing after several of its members returned positive doping tests . bildunterschrift : steiner dedicated his gold medal to his late wife who was killed in a car accident in 2007 dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german strongman matthias steiner is putting his weight behind the anti-doping programs . over 4,000 doping tests have been carried out so far as part of the anti-doping program at the beijing games , the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- said wednesday , aug .
20 . " we are now at a total of 4,133 tests of which 3,292 are urine and 848 are blood tests , " ioc communications director giselle davies told reporters .
" we 'll get to some 4,500 by the end of the games , the highest number of testing done in any olympic games as part of our efforts in the fight against doping . " the figure compares with 3,500 at the athens games four years ago and 2,800 at the 2000 sydney games . there have been a handful of positive tests so far , compared with a total 26 four years ago .
only one medal winner - shooter jong-su kim from north korea - has been stripped of his prize . heptathlon silver medallist lyudmila blonska , however , is under doping investigation at the beijing games , olympic sources told the dpa news agency on wednesday .
it was not known immediately for which substance the 29-year-old ukrainian tested positive .
if the positive test is confirmed she faces a life ban as a second-time offender . ahead of the games , ioc president jacques rogge said he expected 30 to 40 positive tests , based on results from previous olympics .
but davies insisted this year 's low numbers were an indication that doping deterrents were effective . natural strength german weightlifter matthias steiner , who won his first olympic gold medal this week , said he 'd been tested 10 times this year already and is a strong supporter of anti-doping efforts . " i certainly believe it 's a positive development , the fact that doping systems work and are effective , " the heavy-weight said tuesday , referring to the increased testing . performance-enhancing substances are particularly common in certain sports , including weightlifting , track and field , and cycling . bulgaria was forced to withdraw its weightlifting team from the games in beijing after several of its members returned positive doping tests . bildunterschrift : steiner dedicated his gold medal to his late wife who was killed in a car accident in 2007 dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.08.2008 russia to back independence for abkhazia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has committed to support abkhazia and south ossetia georgia 's rebel region of abkhazia is reportedly set to lodge a formal appeal for moscow to recognize it as an independent state .
any move toward formal independence is n't likely to sit well with tbilisi . abkhazia will hold a special parliamentary session on wednesday , aug .
20 , to consider an independence appeal to russia for recognition by the breakaway region 's president sergei bagapsh , abkhaz parliamentary speaker nugzar ashuba told interfax news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazia has its own flag " we will request to recognize the independence of our republic , " ashuba was quoted as saying . the speaker of russia 's upper house of parliament , sergei mironov , meanwhile said wednesday that russian lawmakers were " ready " to recognize the regions independence from georgia .
an emergency session would be held on monday to discuss the request , he added . " the council of federation is ready to recognize an independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia , if the peoples of the two republics want it and if there is a supporting decision of the president of russia , " mironov was quoted as saying in the southern russia city of vladikavkaz , where he visited refugees from the conflict in georgia 's other breakaway region of south ossetia . the decision by the council of federation , russia 's upper house of parliament , would have to be approved by president dmitry medvedev , said mironov .
however , medvedev has already promised support for any decision made by abkhazia or south ossetia . de facto independence russian troops on wednesday remained in the two breakaway regions , although medvedev has said that all but 500 soldiers would withdraw by the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakaway regions , shown in yellow , won de facto independence in the early 1990s both abkhazia and south ossetia have enjoyed de facto independence since winning a war of succession from georgia in the early 1990s .
they have since strengthened their ties with russia , though russia has not yet formally recognized their independence . most residents in the two separatist provinces have been issued russian passports in recent years , but while south ossetians would like to unite with the ethnically-linked russian region of north ossetia , abkhazia is lobbying to be recognized as an independent country . russian lawmakers gave voice to both independence movements in the wake of kosovo 's independence , claiming the cases could not be distinguished , and russia 's increasing support for the rebel regions in recent months was part of the flame that led to war with georgia in south ossetia last week . any formal move toward independence for abkhazia and south ossetia is likely to upset georgian president mikheil saakashvili , who promised during his election campaign to bring both regions under tbilisi 's control . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .
konyushin , the russian ambassador , said russia was hoping the assembly would place the issue on the agenda in september . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tension over the war in the caucasus has aggravated the west 's relations with moscow . russian president dmitry medvedev told his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation on tuesday , aug .
19 , that all but 500 russian troops would leave georgia by friday .
he had earlier promised the troop pullback would begin on monday . moscow and western leaders clashed at the united nations on tuesday when russia , which holds a veto power in the security council , refused to support a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops . the draft resolution , presented to the council by france , reaffirmed " the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said it would be " a waste of time " to put the resolution to a vote . cold war frame of mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote on the french resolution never came before the security council tension between moscow and western capitals grew earlier in the day at a nato summit where the alliance 's foreign minister clashed with russia over the recent conflict in would-be nato member georgia .
russia also accused nato of cold war thinking . nato " is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe ...
it 's time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw back to the status quo ante of august 6-7 , " before fighting in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia broke out , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a meeting with nato counterparts on tuesday . " what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled ? "
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer added , again referring to an eu-brokered cease-fire deal signed by dmitry medvedev on aug .
12 .
nato officials say russia is breaking the deal . at the emergency meeting , the foreign ministers of nato 's 26 member states agreed not to hold any more sessions of the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , which is the main platform for nato-russia dialogue , until russian troops pull out of georgia , and decided to create a new commission for dialogue with membership hopeful georgia . " russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role , as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution , " a joint statement after the meeting said .
" we can not continue with business as usual . " accusations fly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia accusses the us of aiding georgia 's campaign but russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , hit back strongly , accusing the us of helping georgia plan its attack on south ossetia , de hoop scheffer of acting as a us pawn and nato as a whole of keeping a cold war mentality . " today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war , it does n't matter what their propaganda says , " he said . " -lrb- georgian president mikhail -rrb- saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations , " he added , accusing nato of " turning a blind eye " to the destruction wrought by georgian forces on civilians in the breakaway province of south ossetia . " the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression ... and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies , " he said . russia can not cooperate with nato if it insists on " protecting criminals , " rogozin said . " if nato wants to cooperate with criminals , we ca n't stop them , but we can not cooperate anymore with an organization which works with criminals , " said rogozin , who compared saakashvili to hitler and saddam hussein . nato membership remains a hot topic in april , nato leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the alliance at an unspecified future point .
the alliance 's foreign ministers are set to discuss the issue further in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't tolerate georgia as a nato member but immediately after the decision , which russia criticized as a threat to its security , tensions between georgia and its breakaway provinces flared dramatically .
the tensions culminated in a georgian attack on south ossetia on aug .
7 and a russian military response which pushed well into georgian territory . french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who engaged in shuttle diplomacy to bring about a cease-fire , said tuesday that " if the european union had not moved , tbilisi would have been captured . " rogozin rejected that claim , saying that " russia 's actions were never intended to destroy , occupy or force regime change in georgia . " communication cut off by both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer put nato talks with russia on hold while de hoop scheffer said nato would not call any further nrc meetings until russia pulls its troops out of georgia , rogozin retorted that it would be up to nato to return to talks . " we will keep our very good bilateral contacts -lrb- with nato members -rrb- ... and hopefully there will be a better time sooner or later when nato understands that the world is very vulnerable and that bloc approaches are no longer possible , " he said . he also insisted that the row was not about to plumb the depths it saw during the cold war .

" the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression ... and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies , " he said . russia can not cooperate with nato if it insists on " protecting criminals , " rogozin said .

he had earlier promised the troop pullback would begin on monday . moscow and western leaders clashed at the united nations on tuesday when russia , which holds a veto power in the security council , refused to support a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops . the draft resolution , presented to the council by france , reaffirmed " the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said it would be " a waste of time " to put the resolution to a vote . cold war frame of mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote on the french resolution never came before the security council tension between moscow and western capitals grew earlier in the day at a nato summit where the alliance 's foreign minister clashed with russia over the recent conflict in would-be nato member georgia .
russia also accused nato of cold war thinking . nato " is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe ...
it 's time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw back to the status quo ante of august 6-7 , " before fighting in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia broke out , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a meeting with nato counterparts on tuesday . " what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled ? "
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer added , again referring to an eu-brokered cease-fire deal signed by dmitry medvedev on aug .
12 .
nato officials say russia is breaking the deal . at the emergency meeting , the foreign ministers of nato 's 26 member states agreed not to hold any more sessions of the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , which is the main platform for nato-russia dialogue , until russian troops pull out of georgia , and decided to create a new commission for dialogue with membership hopeful georgia . " russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role , as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution , " a joint statement after the meeting said .
" we can not continue with business as usual . " accusations fly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia accusses the us of aiding georgia 's campaign but russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , hit back strongly , accusing the us of helping georgia plan its attack on south ossetia , de hoop scheffer of acting as a us pawn and nato as a whole of keeping a cold war mentality . " today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war , it does n't matter what their propaganda says , " he said . " -lrb- georgian president mikhail -rrb- saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations , " he added , accusing nato of " turning a blind eye " to the destruction wrought by georgian forces on civilians in the breakaway province of south ossetia . " the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression ... and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies , " he said . russia can not cooperate with nato if it insists on " protecting criminals , " rogozin said . " if nato wants to cooperate with criminals , we ca n't stop them , but we can not cooperate anymore with an organization which works with criminals , " said rogozin , who compared saakashvili to hitler and saddam hussein . nato membership remains a hot topic in april , nato leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the alliance at an unspecified future point .
the alliance 's foreign ministers are set to discuss the issue further in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't tolerate georgia as a nato member but immediately after the decision , which russia criticized as a threat to its security , tensions between georgia and its breakaway provinces flared dramatically .
the tensions culminated in a georgian attack on south ossetia on aug .
7 and a russian military response which pushed well into georgian territory . french foreign minister bernard kouchner , who engaged in shuttle diplomacy to bring about a cease-fire , said tuesday that " if the european union had not moved , tbilisi would have been captured . " rogozin rejected that claim , saying that " russia 's actions were never intended to destroy , occupy or force regime change in georgia . " communication cut off by both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer put nato talks with russia on hold while de hoop scheffer said nato would not call any further nrc meetings until russia pulls its troops out of georgia , rogozin retorted that it would be up to nato to return to talks . " we will keep our very good bilateral contacts -lrb- with nato members -rrb- ... and hopefully there will be a better time sooner or later when nato understands that the world is very vulnerable and that bloc approaches are no longer possible , " he said . he also insisted that the row was not about to plumb the depths it saw during the cold war . " it 's clear -lrb- russia 's relationship with nato -rrb- wo n't stay as it was before , there will be a lot of changes in the volume , quality and time-frame of our meetings , " he said .
" this situation will change but there will be no cold war . " dw staff -lrb- nda / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spanish media said one engine caught fire as it took off .
differing reports of casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the barajas airport runway was an inferno smoke billowed from the wreckage of flight jk 5022 off the bottom of the runway .
helicopters dropped water to douse the flames of the jet and grassfires caused by the crash .
madrid airport cancelled departures after the crash and restricted the number of flights arriving .
regional authorities said 153 people died in the crash - making it one of the worst air disasters in europe in recent years .
a spokesman said 15 of those injured were in serious condition .
twenty-five people were lightly injured and 35 had been recorded as having escaped unharmed .
a spanair spokesman told afp there were 164 passengers and nine crew on board the md-82 .
sas , the scandinavian airline group which owns spanair , said a special team had been set up in madrid .
" sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities . "
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero interrupted his holiday to go to the scene , his office said .
spain 's second biggest airline in mourning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash was captured on video by an eye-witness spanair released a statement confirming the flight was in an " incident " at madrid airport but giving no other detail .
" spanair is doing everything possible to assist the spanish authorities at this difficult time , " it said .
spanair is spain 's second biggest airline after iberia .
five passengers on a spanair flight from spain 's basque region to barcelona were injured in an emergency evacuation on january 9 , 2006 .
the airline was founded in 1986 and says it has carried more than 104 million passengers from about 100 european destinations to spain since then .
it has a fleet of 65 jets .
it is a member of the star alliance network but recently proposed shedding almost a quarter of its 4,000 staff because of the fuel price rise crisis and reduced demand .
the airline posted net losses of 41 million euros -lrb- 62 million dollars -rrb- in the first quarter .
sas shares plunged 6.41 percent on the stockholm stock exchange after the crash .
sas had put spanair on the block earlier this year but announced in june that it was abandoning those plans due to the slowdown in the aviation sector . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .
konyushin , the russian ambassador , said russia was hoping the assembly would place the issue on the agenda in september . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , and still need parliamentary approval , will mean moves from non-european union controlled investment groups or companies to buy a stake of 25 percent or more in strategic parts of german industry can in future be blocked . " the majority of foreign investments wo n't be affected by the draft law , " said economy minister michael glos setting out details of the proposals .
" germany is and remains open to foreign investments . " public order and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law is aimed at sensitive sectors such as the energy supply based on a us model , germany 's plans could lead to further attempts across the 27-member eu aimed at blocking foreign investment incursions into sensitive industries .
under germany 's proposals , " public order and security " the principal criteria for triggering a review of foreign groups ' investment plans . but berlin 's drive to enhance government regulation of the push by investment funds operated by foreign governments into corporate germany has set the alarm bells ringing in german business . " foreign investment brings many advantages such as economic growth , employment and as a result rising living standards , " said the general secretary of germany 's international chamber of commerce -lrb- icc -rrb- , angelika pohlenz . she said that the plan to regulate foreign investors could lead to lower foreign investment in germany and trigger limits on german investment in other parts of the world . wrong signal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders say germany should roll out the red carpet for investors the icc 's concerns were echoed across german business with the chief of the nation 's influential federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- , werner schnappauf saying berlin 's new laws sent " the wrong signal for germany as a place to invest . " " as the world 's leading export nation and a key source of foreign investment , germany is heavily dependent on open markets , " said schnappauf , adding that foreign investment underpinned more than 2 million jobs in europe 's biggest economy . a report prepared by the investment house morgan stanley estimated that the state funds could already control up to $ 2.5 trillion -lrb- 1.7 trillion euros -rrb- worldwide , building to $ 12 trillion by 2015 . last year , the chinese government acquired a 10-percent stake in the us private equity house blackstone , which has a key holding in german-based deutsche telekom ag , europe 's biggest phone company . this followed moves by russian state bank vtb to carve an interest in europe 's sensitive aeronautic and defense sector by seeking out a stake in the european aeronautic defense and space group -lrb- eads -rrb- , which is the parent company of the european aircraft maker airbus . hard to control ? at the same time , berlin has spearheaded a push to ensure greater transparency of the international hedge-fund industry , despite the reluctance of both britain and the us to take action to monitor the $ 1.4-trillion business . under the german government 's plans , investors would have to get approval from the government when purchasing more than 25 percent of a major german company .
the economics ministry will have up to three months to look at the purchase and an additional two months to decide whether to veto it . but analysts said that the risk is that foreign state funds could use groups based in other parts of the eu to move in on key german corporations . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

any move toward formal independence is n't likely to sit well with tbilisi . abkhazia will hold a special parliamentary session on wednesday , aug .
20 , to consider an independence appeal to russia for recognition by the breakaway region 's president sergei bagapsh , abkhaz parliamentary speaker nugzar ashuba told interfax news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazia has its own flag " we will request to recognize the independence of our republic , " ashuba was quoted as saying . the speaker of russia 's upper house of parliament , sergei mironov , meanwhile said wednesday that russian lawmakers were " ready " to recognize the regions independence from georgia .
an emergency session would be held on monday to discuss the request , he added . " the council of federation is ready to recognize an independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia , if the peoples of the two republics want it and if there is a supporting decision of the president of russia , " mironov was quoted as saying in the southern russia city of vladikavkaz , where he visited refugees from the conflict in georgia 's other breakaway region of south ossetia . the decision by the council of federation , russia 's upper house of parliament , would have to be approved by president dmitry medvedev , said mironov .
however , medvedev has already promised support for any decision made by abkhazia or south ossetia . de facto independence russian troops on wednesday remained in the two breakaway regions , although medvedev has said that all but 500 soldiers would withdraw by the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the breakaway regions , shown in yellow , won de facto independence in the early 1990s both abkhazia and south ossetia have enjoyed de facto independence since winning a war of succession from georgia in the early 1990s .
they have since strengthened their ties with russia , though russia has not yet formally recognized their independence . most residents in the two separatist provinces have been issued russian passports in recent years , but while south ossetians would like to unite with the ethnically-linked russian region of north ossetia , abkhazia is lobbying to be recognized as an independent country . russian lawmakers gave voice to both independence movements in the wake of kosovo 's independence , claiming the cases could not be distinguished , and russia 's increasing support for the rebel regions in recent months was part of the flame that led to war with georgia in south ossetia last week . any formal move toward independence for abkhazia and south ossetia is likely to upset georgian president mikheil saakashvili , who promised during his election campaign to bring both regions under tbilisi 's control . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tension over the war in the caucasus has aggravated the west 's relations with moscow . russian president dmitry medvedev told his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation on tuesday , aug .
19 , that all but 500 russian troops would leave georgia by friday .
he had earlier promised the troop pullback would begin on monday . moscow and western leaders clashed at the united nations on tuesday when russia , which holds a veto power in the security council , refused to support a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops . the draft resolution , presented to the council by france , reaffirmed " the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said it would be " a waste of time " to put the resolution to a vote . cold war frame of mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vote on the french resolution never came before the security council tension between moscow and western capitals grew earlier in the day at a nato summit where the alliance 's foreign minister clashed with russia over the recent conflict in would-be nato member georgia .
russia also accused nato of cold war thinking . nato " is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe ...
it 's time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw back to the status quo ante of august 6-7 , " before fighting in the georgian breakaway region of south ossetia broke out , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a meeting with nato counterparts on tuesday . " what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled ? "
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer added , again referring to an eu-brokered cease-fire deal signed by dmitry medvedev on aug .
12 .
nato officials say russia is breaking the deal . at the emergency meeting , the foreign ministers of nato 's 26 member states agreed not to hold any more sessions of the nato-russia council -lrb- nrc -rrb- , which is the main platform for nato-russia dialogue , until russian troops pull out of georgia , and decided to create a new commission for dialogue with membership hopeful georgia . " russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role , as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution , " a joint statement after the meeting said .
" we can not continue with business as usual . " accusations fly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia accusses the us of aiding georgia 's campaign but russia 's ambassador to nato , dmitry rogozin , hit back strongly , accusing the us of helping georgia plan its attack on south ossetia , de hoop scheffer of acting as a us pawn and nato as a whole of keeping a cold war mentality . " today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war , it does n't matter what their propaganda says , " he said . " -lrb- georgian president mikhail -rrb- saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations , " he added , accusing nato of " turning a blind eye " to the destruction wrought by georgian forces on civilians in the breakaway province of south ossetia . " the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression ... and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies , " he said . russia can not cooperate with nato if it insists on " protecting criminals , " rogozin said .

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .
konyushin , the russian ambassador , said russia was hoping the assembly would place the issue on the agenda in september . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .

the biggest bible printing press in the world is in the eastern chinese city of nanjing .
anyone bringing bibles into the country is likely to encounter problems at customs however .
in china , the relationship between the state and the christian church remains tense .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
however , many of the estimated 60 to 100 million christians belong to so-called house churches , which are often referred to collectively as the “ underground ” church . the room is filled with the sound of music .
it sounds like a perfectly normal cultural event until one listens to the lyrics .
a christian service is beginning at a family church in beijing .
the prayers are accompanied by electric guitar and drums .
the church was founded about two years ago with the help of south korean missionaries .
it now has 500 members , who meet every sunday for a service in a rented conference room in the north of the chinese capital : one believer leads the others in prayer - they finish with “ amen ” .
then they discuss selected excerpts from the bible .
a young woman called cui climbs onto the podium and talks about her recently experiences volunteering in the earthquake zone .
she grew up in atheist china .
christianity has transformed her , she says : “ when god touches you , it changes your inner self in a magic way .
your former knowledge and experiences remain but your heart changes . ”
restrictive state-sanctioned religion although the right to religious freedom is firmly embedded in the chinese constitution , in practice only state-controlled forms of religious expression are allowed .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
the chinese protestant three-self patriotic movement and the china christian council form the official protestant church .
there is also the chinese patriotic catholic association , which is not recognised by rome .
the state-sanctioned churches ’ priests and bishops are nominated and paid by the state .
for this reason , many chinese christians feel that their religious freedom is restricted .
many catholics who remain loyal to the vatican or protestants who want to practise their religion more freely choose to join so-called house or family churches .
these are in theory illegal but usually tolerated .
however , the persecution of underground priests and believers continues .
in the run-up to the olympic games this year , 21 house pastors were sent to labour camps .
defending freedom of belief zhang kai is a member of the “ zion ” family church and a lawyer who represents believers , whose religious freedom rights have been violated : “ the heart of religious freedom lies in the separation of the church and the state , ” he explains .
“ a secular government should not venture into the territory of religion .
it also has no right to judge which religion is good or bad .
otherwise there is a violation of religious freedom and of the constitution , as well as the secular principle . ”
his most prominent case brought him to the province of zhejiang , where the local police had torn down the chapel of an underground church but in beijing he feels that the authorities are less brutal .
“ in june , the beijing police bureau in beijing banned an event .
they also wanted us to stop our services .
but the ban was unjustified and counter-constitutional .
since then the restrictions have been relaxed .
generally , the atmosphere is quite free at our church events . “ all believers are required by the police to register their personal details when they join a church .
but this does not seem to be stopping people from joining house churches such as the zion family church .
independent sources estimate the number of christians in china to lie between 60 and a hundred million .
the numbers are reportedly rising daily . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 20/08/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

some attribute the minor increase to financial bonuses for children introduced last year . women in germany had an average of 1.37 children in 2007 , up from 1.33 in 2006 , said the federal statistical office on wednesday , aug .
20 .
some 685,000 babies were born in germany in 2007 , or 12,000 more than in the previous year . the slight jump - the first since 2004 - was good news in a country whose population is aging rapidly . in particular , births increased among women aged 33 to 37 , while they decreased among younger women . for the first time since german reunification in 1991 , women in eastern germany had as many children as those in western germany , according to the report .
the birth-rate in eastern germany had dropped sharply after reunification . some have attributed the higher birth rate to family allowances , which the government introduced in 2007 , which is an income-based sum paid out monthly for 12 to 14 months after a child 's birth .
it was originally designed to allow working women more flexibility in finding child care . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some attribute the minor increase to financial bonuses for children introduced last year . women in germany had an average of 1.37 children in 2007 , up from 1.33 in 2006 , said the federal statistical office on wednesday , aug .
20 .
some 685,000 babies were born in germany in 2007 , or 12,000 more than in the previous year . the slight jump - the first since 2004 - was good news in a country whose population is aging rapidly . in particular , births increased among women aged 33 to 37 , while they decreased among younger women . for the first time since german reunification in 1991 , women in eastern germany had as many children as those in western germany , according to the report .
the birth-rate in eastern germany had dropped sharply after reunification . some have attributed the higher birth rate to family allowances , which the government introduced in 2007 , which is an income-based sum paid out monthly for 12 to 14 months after a child 's birth .
it was originally designed to allow working women more flexibility in finding child care . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the economics ministry will have up to three months to look at the purchase and an additional two months to decide whether to veto it . but analysts said that the risk is that foreign state funds could use groups based in other parts of the eu to move in on key german corporations . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .

in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .

some attribute the minor increase to financial bonuses for children introduced last year . women in germany had an average of 1.37 children in 2007 , up from 1.33 in 2006 , said the federal statistical office on wednesday , aug .
20 .
some 685,000 babies were born in germany in 2007 , or 12,000 more than in the previous year . the slight jump - the first since 2004 - was good news in a country whose population is aging rapidly . in particular , births increased among women aged 33 to 37 , while they decreased among younger women . for the first time since german reunification in 1991 , women in eastern germany had as many children as those in western germany , according to the report .
the birth-rate in eastern germany had dropped sharply after reunification . some have attributed the higher birth rate to family allowances , which the government introduced in 2007 , which is an income-based sum paid out monthly for 12 to 14 months after a child 's birth .
it was originally designed to allow working women more flexibility in finding child care . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .

economic sanctions would only aggravate the situation .
russia could retaliate by reducing energy exports to europe , which could upset the european part of nato .
in any case , the giant state can not be economically isolated in the globalized economy . military force is clearly not an option .
that is why all of the nato member states are very happy that georgia is not yet a member or formal candidate country .
foreign minister do not feel like letting themselves be drawn into the confusion of the caucasus conflict .
thus only words remain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier is completely right when he says that nato 's role in the region is somewhat small .
do the nato member states have to let russia walk all over them then ?
could n't they throw the russians out of the g8 group of highly industrialized nations and not even let them into the world trade organization ? russia seeks revenge that would probably only cause russia to turn further away from the so-called western camp .
the georgian conflict makes it painfully clear that nato , europe and the usa only have a very limited influence on a russia that is becoming economically stronger and increasingly acting imperialistically . one could give in to the understandable desire seek a punishment for russia .
but , in the end , what does anyone stand to gain from another ice age ?
but on the other hand , the eu and nato can not simply go back to normal when it comes to russia .
the baltic states , poland , the czech republic , all those that suffered under the former soviet empire expect more from the alliance . it seems as though russia is now looking to avenge all of the scandals that , in its eyes , it has had to suffer in the last few years : the expansion of nato , war against serbia , the attack on iraq that violated international law , separation of kosovo from the confederate serbia , the missile defense shield . the west must talk with russia from nato 's point of view , russia 's objections are nonsensical , but at the moment russia seems to have more leverage .
the strategic partnership with russia that was once strived for is collapsing .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has refused to tolerate russia drawing a line around its would-be sphere of influence .
now she has to hurry with suggestion on how to keep russia from doing so .
because what happens if russia decides , after georgia , that maybe they have to rush to the aid of russian citizens in moldovan transnistria or ukrainian crimea ? the american president and the european union should push for an immediate summit with the russian president and his prime minister in order to deal with the problem on the highest level .
only then would russia feel that it is being taken seriously , only then can russia and the usa resolve their quarrel over their plaything georgia .
that reminds one of the awful scenarios of the cold war , when nuclear threats and arms races were dealt with at umpteen summits between the two superpowers .

" the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory ... -lrb- while -rrb- the u.s. installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement , " said polish prime minister donald tusk , reuters reported .

" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent . " russia 's deputy chief of general staff , gen anatoly nogovitsyn , said last week the plans for the missile base in poland " could not go unpunished . " " it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation , the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia , " he said , according to the bbc . missile defense simply a safeguard , says rice rice , however , reiterated the missile shield is " purely defensive " and strengthens strategic cooperation with poland , a former soviet-bloc nation that was among the first to join nato after the cold war ended . " this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone , " she said .
" this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site ... that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long-range missile -lrb- attacks -rrb- from countries like iran or north korea . " we 're talking about a missile defense system that could n't possibly be aimed at the russian nuclear deterrent , " she told the bbc on tuesday .
" russia has thousands of nuclear warheads .
this is for small missile attacks of the kind that iran might launch . " shield accord signals new strength for poland , kaczynski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish leader lech kaczynski believes us shield has improved poland 's global position polish president lech kaczynski called the signing an " important day " in polish history during a televised address to the nation tuesday night . poland had taken a step to " strengthen its position in the world " by sealing the agreement with washington , he said . in july , the czech government agreed to host the system 's radar in a military area near the german border . approval by the czech and polish parliaments is required before the project can go ahead .
the system would represent the first us military bases in the two former warsaw pact nations . the us plan had been unpopular in both countries , but a recent poll showed polish opinion has swung in favor of the shield in the wake of the fighting over the breakaway region of south ossetia between russia and georgia . some 58 percent of poles canvassed said they now supported the pentagon 's plan . many poles view russia 's military incursion into georgia as proof that poland needs to bolster its defensive capabilities . dpa news ageny -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .
konyushin , the russian ambassador , said russia was hoping the assembly would place the issue on the agenda in september . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory ... -lrb- while -rrb- the u.s. installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement , " said polish prime minister donald tusk , reuters reported .
" our countries , poland and the united states , will be more secure . " russia regards system as affront russia has fiercely opposed the missile shield , due to be operational by 2013 , saying it would respond by targeting its two former satellite states with a potential nuclear strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains in heated opposition to the us missile shield plans the decision by poland , and earlier by the czech republic , to host elements of the us shield , " has the russian federation as its target , " russian president dimitry medvedev told a joint press conference after a meeting in sochi on the black sea last friday , the international herald tribune reported .
" this is sad for europe , sad for all in this densely populated continent . " russia 's deputy chief of general staff , gen anatoly nogovitsyn , said last week the plans for the missile base in poland " could not go unpunished . " " it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation , the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia , " he said , according to the bbc . missile defense simply a safeguard , says rice rice , however , reiterated the missile shield is " purely defensive " and strengthens strategic cooperation with poland , a former soviet-bloc nation that was among the first to join nato after the cold war ended . " this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone , " she said .
" this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site ... that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long-range missile -lrb- attacks -rrb- from countries like iran or north korea . " we 're talking about a missile defense system that could n't possibly be aimed at the russian nuclear deterrent , " she told the bbc on tuesday .
" russia has thousands of nuclear warheads .
this is for small missile attacks of the kind that iran might launch . " shield accord signals new strength for poland , kaczynski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish leader lech kaczynski believes us shield has improved poland 's global position polish president lech kaczynski called the signing an " important day " in polish history during a televised address to the nation tuesday night . poland had taken a step to " strengthen its position in the world " by sealing the agreement with washington , he said . in july , the czech government agreed to host the system 's radar in a military area near the german border . approval by the czech and polish parliaments is required before the project can go ahead .
the system would represent the first us military bases in the two former warsaw pact nations . the us plan had been unpopular in both countries , but a recent poll showed polish opinion has swung in favor of the shield in the wake of the fighting over the breakaway region of south ossetia between russia and georgia . some 58 percent of poles canvassed said they now supported the pentagon 's plan . many poles view russia 's military incursion into georgia as proof that poland needs to bolster its defensive capabilities . dpa news ageny -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the biggest bible printing press in the world is in the eastern chinese city of nanjing .
anyone bringing bibles into the country is likely to encounter problems at customs however .
in china , the relationship between the state and the christian church remains tense .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
however , many of the estimated 60 to 100 million christians belong to so-called house churches , which are often referred to collectively as the “ underground ” church . the room is filled with the sound of music .
it sounds like a perfectly normal cultural event until one listens to the lyrics .
a christian service is beginning at a family church in beijing .
the prayers are accompanied by electric guitar and drums .
the church was founded about two years ago with the help of south korean missionaries .
it now has 500 members , who meet every sunday for a service in a rented conference room in the north of the chinese capital : one believer leads the others in prayer - they finish with “ amen ” .
then they discuss selected excerpts from the bible .
a young woman called cui climbs onto the podium and talks about her recently experiences volunteering in the earthquake zone .
she grew up in atheist china .
christianity has transformed her , she says : “ when god touches you , it changes your inner self in a magic way .
your former knowledge and experiences remain but your heart changes . ”
restrictive state-sanctioned religion although the right to religious freedom is firmly embedded in the chinese constitution , in practice only state-controlled forms of religious expression are allowed .
there are two state-sanctioned christian churches .
the chinese protestant three-self patriotic movement and the china christian council form the official protestant church .
there is also the chinese patriotic catholic association , which is not recognised by rome .
the state-sanctioned churches ’ priests and bishops are nominated and paid by the state .
for this reason , many chinese christians feel that their religious freedom is restricted .
many catholics who remain loyal to the vatican or protestants who want to practise their religion more freely choose to join so-called house or family churches .
these are in theory illegal but usually tolerated .
however , the persecution of underground priests and believers continues .
in the run-up to the olympic games this year , 21 house pastors were sent to labour camps .
defending freedom of belief zhang kai is a member of the “ zion ” family church and a lawyer who represents believers , whose religious freedom rights have been violated : “ the heart of religious freedom lies in the separation of the church and the state , ” he explains .
“ a secular government should not venture into the territory of religion .
it also has no right to judge which religion is good or bad .
otherwise there is a violation of religious freedom and of the constitution , as well as the secular principle . ”
his most prominent case brought him to the province of zhejiang , where the local police had torn down the chapel of an underground church but in beijing he feels that the authorities are less brutal .
“ in june , the beijing police bureau in beijing banned an event .
they also wanted us to stop our services .
but the ban was unjustified and counter-constitutional .
since then the restrictions have been relaxed .
generally , the atmosphere is quite free at our church events . “ all believers are required by the police to register their personal details when they join a church .
but this does not seem to be stopping people from joining house churches such as the zion family church .
independent sources estimate the number of christians in china to lie between 60 and a hundred million .
the numbers are reportedly rising daily . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 20/08/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media pakistani taliban a suicide attack on a paramilitary academy to avenge bin laden 's death has killed dozens .

the recent increase in eu participation in kosovo has come without a go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
" we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law , " tanjug news agency quoted bogdanovic as telling journalists on a visit to kosovo .
resolution 1244 authorised the presence of unmik after nato bombing in 1999 drove out serbian forces waging a crackdown on ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
the un began downsizing its mission monday without the go-head from the council , albeit owing to the veto power of moscow , which has sided with belgrade over the handover to eulex .
the un also signed a memorandum of understanding with the eu on monday to hand eulex property including buildings , vehicles and equipment .
un secretary general orders unmik reshuffle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmik police in kosovo have begun to hand their posts those steps were in line with un secretary general ban ki-moon 's plans to put eulex under the umbrella of a reconfigured unmik , as he announced in june just days before kosovo adopted its first constitution .
in his july report to the council he highlighted " a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration . "
he said that because the council was " unable to give guidance " he had asked the mission to cooperate with the eu " in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations . "
serbia sees only 1244 but belgrade remains staunchly opposed to any changes in kosovo outside of 1244 , which also affirms serbia 's sovereignty over the territory it views as the cradle of its history , culture and religion .
" the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik , nor the agreement with eulex , " said bogdanovic .
" all deals that are n't passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia , " added the serbian minister .
eulex mission to kosovo illegitimate : russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eulex head yves de kermabon russian ambassador to belgrade alexander konuzin told politika daily in an interview published on sunday that serbia could count on " energetic " russian support in its opposition to the eu 's mission to kosovo .
russia was aware that the reconfiguration had started and planned to file a protest to the un secratariat , he said .
so far , the eu mission has deployed 285 officials including police , judges , prosecutors and custom officers in kosovo .
it will eventually employ around 3,000 officials .
moscow supports serbian initiative the ethnic albanian majority of kosovo declared independence from serbia on february 17 .
russia and china supported serbia 's rejection of the move before the un security council , but leading western nations , including the united states and the majority of european union countries , went ahead and recognized kosovo as a sovereign country , triggering a downgrade of diplomatic relations from belgrade .
serbia on friday submitted a request for the un general assembly to debate kosovo 's declaration of independence and to ask the hague-based international court of justice , a un world court , to rule on the issue .
konyushin , the russian ambassador , said russia was hoping the assembly would place the issue on the agenda in september . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the watchdog will give recommendations for the future of baa in a preliminary report at 0700 bst on wednesday .
baa , whose seven airports include gatwick , stansted and heathrow , has been accused of poor service .
the commission has said baa 's ownership structure might not serve well the interests of passengers or airlines .
baa 's chairman recently told the bbc he expected the commission to order the break-up of the company , but that such a move would not lead to effective competition against baa 's main airport heathrow .
as well as a near-monopoly in the south east of england through its ownership of heathrow , gatwick and stansted , baa also owns edinburgh , glasgow , southampton and aberdeen airports .
the watchdog launched an enquiry into baa following concerns that its ownership of multiple airports meant it was overstretched , and might lack the capacity to embark on several development projects simultaneously .
next steps if the watchdog says the current ownership model is not in the public interest then baa could be forced to sell gatwick and / or stansted airports and also either edinburgh or glasgow airport .
it is thought that several international companies might be interested in buying different baa airports including manchester airport group and global infrastructure .
other airlines have long urged baa , which handles more than 60 % of all flights arriving and leaving the uk , to be broken up .
baa , which was acquired by spain 's ferrovial in 2006 , has faced stiff criticism for its poor customer service , most recently for its handling of the terminal 5 opening at heathrow .
but it has also had the burden of higher security and maintenance costs .
the commission 's initial report in april said it was worried by " baa 's approach to the system of planning airport development " .
on monday , baa said it had managed to refinance £ 13.3bn in debt , of which £ 3bn could be used for investment immediately .

the watchdog will give recommendations for the future of baa in a preliminary report at 0700 bst on wednesday .
baa , whose seven airports include gatwick , stansted and heathrow , has been accused of poor service .
the commission has said baa 's ownership structure might not serve well the interests of passengers or airlines .
baa 's chairman recently told the bbc he expected the commission to order the break-up of the company , but that such a move would not lead to effective competition against baa 's main airport heathrow .
as well as a near-monopoly in the south east of england through its ownership of heathrow , gatwick and stansted , baa also owns edinburgh , glasgow , southampton and aberdeen airports .
the watchdog launched an enquiry into baa following concerns that its ownership of multiple airports meant it was overstretched , and might lack the capacity to embark on several development projects simultaneously .
next steps if the watchdog says the current ownership model is not in the public interest then baa could be forced to sell gatwick and / or stansted airports and also either edinburgh or glasgow airport .
it is thought that several international companies might be interested in buying different baa airports including manchester airport group and global infrastructure .
other airlines have long urged baa , which handles more than 60 % of all flights arriving and leaving the uk , to be broken up .
baa , which was acquired by spain 's ferrovial in 2006 , has faced stiff criticism for its poor customer service , most recently for its handling of the terminal 5 opening at heathrow .
but it has also had the burden of higher security and maintenance costs .
the commission 's initial report in april said it was worried by " baa 's approach to the system of planning airport development " .
on monday , baa said it had managed to refinance £ 13.3bn in debt , of which £ 3bn could be used for investment immediately .

a certificate from guinness world records will be presented at the ground at the wales v romania under-21 game on wednesday .
the accolade is thanks to lifelong wrexham fc fan glyn davies , who wrote to guinness .
the stadium has a 200-year history as a sporting venue .
mr davies , of wrexham fc collectors and history society , said : " it 's great news .
there 's a lot of history here , and there were another couple of clubs who were trying to lay claim to the title but the racecourse beats them both by more than 20 years .
" i spent a couple of months researching how to put a case to guinness , and eventually wrote to them .
" they said i needed to prove that the venue was still being used for internationals , and because there were n't any scheduled i had to write to the football association of wales to ask for their support .
" i got a letter back confirming that they will be playing senior internationals there in the future .
" that was all that was needed , and guinness confirmed everything a couple of months later . "
in an e-mail to the club , guinness wrote : " we were contacted a few months ago by lifelong wrexham fan glyn davies who believed the racecourse ground to be the oldest international football ground .
" today , after receiving confirmation from the faw that the racecourse will still be used for senior international matches we are delighted to confirm that the racecourse is indeed the holder of the guinness world record for ' oldest international football ground ' . "
the aptly-named racecourse was initially known as a horse racing venue , and staged its first contest - the town purse - in 1807 .
at the time it offered a prize of 20 guineas , worth about £ 3,600 today .
after about 50 years , the races were stopped amid concerns that they encouraged crowd trouble , including drunkenness .
in the 1860s , the venue began to be used for autumn sports , including donkey races and cycle races .
as well as horse racing , the racecourse was also used by wrexham cricket club , and it was the club 's members who formed wrexham football club in 1872 as a way of keeping active during the winter months .
research shows the football club was formed in the now famous turf hotel , which stands just outside the ground and where historians say players used to change for matches .
the first international football match was held five years later in 1877 , when wales lost 2-0 to scotland .
the following year , however , wrexham fc won the first ever welsh cup .
wrexham fc now has plans to form its own property development company and wants to develop land around the stadium , including a new stand at the kop end of the ground .
the ground 's new official status as a record holder has received recognition in the welsh assembly chamber .
wrexham am lesley griffiths tabled a statement of opinion at the senedd .
she said : " this is a wonderful achievement to have confirmed by guinness world records and i congratulate glyn davies on his excellent detective work in establishing the record as being correct .
" the racecourse is known all over the world as a great football stadium and many people have some great memories about games they have seen at the ground . "

it was a vivid and eerie soundtrack of how close the insurgency is to the capital .
the second rocket attack in kabul in less than a week will further feed the paranoia of afghans and also the international community .

and it was not the only major operation launched by the taleban in one night .
in khost , south-eastern afghanistan , up to 30 militants tried to storm the main american base in the town , just hours after a suicide car bomber had struck at the front gate killing 10 civilians working at camp salerno .
among those insurgents were at least half a dozen suicide bombers , trying to break into the camp and kill as many nato soldiers as possible .
the attack was repelled and , as in serobi , many of the taleban were killed or injured , but there appears to be plenty of others ready to pick up their guns , or strap on explosives vests , and take on a much better equipped and more highly trained army .
the tactics are becoming more advanced and more brazen - it is as if the insurgents are gathering momentum in the growing insecurity and instability .

france recently took command of the isaf mission around kabul it was a vivid and eerie soundtrack of how close the insurgency is to the capital .
the second rocket attack in kabul in less than a week will further feed the paranoia of afghans and also the international community .
but that paranoia may not be misplaced - while the sirens were warning of incoming fire , french forces were fighting for their lives just 50km -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- away .
they had been ambushed on monday afternoon as they patrolled through sarobi district in kabul province , and despite sending in reinforcements , medical teams and attack aircraft , they lost 10 soldiers - another 21 were injured .
significant impact it is one of the largest losses of life in nato 's afghan campaign and a huge blow to a french deployment which is already unpopular at home .
there are reports of 100 insurgents attacking the convoy , of troops being captured and then killed .
what happened in that valley could have a significant impact on the french mission , so much so that president nicolas sarkozy is flying straight to kabul to settle nerves and offer support .
and it was not the only major operation launched by the taleban in one night .
france 's deployment is unpopular at home in khost , south-eastern afghanistan , up to 30 militants tried to storm the main american base in the town , just hours after a suicide car bomber had struck at the front gate killing 10 civilians working at camp salerno .
among those insurgents were at least half a dozen suicide bombers , trying to break into the camp and kill as many nato soldiers as possible .
the attack was repelled and , as in serobi , many of the taleban were killed or injured , but there appears to be plenty of others ready to pick up their guns , or strap on explosives vests , and take on a much better equipped and more highly trained army .
the tactics are becoming more advanced and more brazen - it is as if the insurgents are gathering momentum in the growing insecurity and instability .
threatened attack on monday , which was afghanistan 's independence day , much of kabul was sealed off by thousands of extra police drafted in when the taleban announced they were planning a major attack .
kabul had the appearance of a city under siege - exactly what the terror tactics of the insurgents hoped to achieve the streets were empty , armoured cars stood guard at junctions , international workers were locked down and told to stay indoors , but the threat remained just a threat and it provoked quite a reaction .
kabul had the appearance of a city under siege - exactly what the terror tactics of the insurgents hoped to achieve .
the aid community in kabul has already been shaken by the murder of three foreign women who worked for the international rescue committee .
they and their afghan driver were killed last week in an ambush as they drove through logar province , which neighbours kabul to the south .
the other road to the south-west , which is the main highway around the country , is potholed with the craters of roadside bombs and littered with vehicles like fuel trucks ambushed and burned .
humanitarian workers are having a long , hard think about where they can and can not operate and whether they should even be in afghanistan any more .
stronger insurgency it is another seemingly deliberate tactic in an insurgency which is creeping in on kabul , squeezing efforts to develop and rebuild the country and exposing a vacuum where the government 's grip of the country is slipping .
widespread corruption and insecurity is allowing perhaps only a small number of insurgents to give the impression they are more powerful then they really are .
the paranoia , the fear and the lack of faith in the government are all in the minds of the people - but that is where insurgency campaigns are won or lost .
shortly after the all-clear siren sounded at isaf headquarters in kabul on tuesday night , the air was again broken by the morning 's first call to prayer .
afghanistan is a deeply conservative , religious and traditional country whose people have seen foreigners come and then go , often after bloodshed .
the war is not lost , but the strength of the insurgents is seen as being stronger now than it has been since the taleban were driven from power .

governments should be ramping up efforts to make sure we have enough to grow crops as well as enough to drink , he argues . "
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it " " this year , the world and , in particular , developing countries and the poor have been hit by both food and energy crises .
as a consequence , prices for many staple foods have risen by up to 100 % .
when we examine the causes of the food crisis , there are many contributing factors : a growing population , changes in trade patterns , urbanisation , dietary habits , biofuel production , climate change and regional droughts .
thus , we have a classic increase in prices as a result of high demand and low supply .
however , few commentators specifically mention the declining availability of water that is needed to grow irrigated and rain-fed crops .
according to some , the often mooted solution to the food crisis lies in plant breeding that produces the ultimate high yielding , low water-consuming crops .
while this solution is important , it will fail unless attention is paid to where the water for all the food , fibre and energy crops is going to come from .
thirsty world the causes of water scarcity are essentially identical to those of the food crisis .
there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries .
population growth over the next four decades will see the number of people in the world increase from 6.5 billion up to 9.0 billion .
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it .
so on average , we require between 2,000 and 3,000 litres of water per person to sustain our daily food requirements .
we will have 2.5 billion extra mouths to feed by 2050 , so finding the extra water each year will not be an easy task , given that it is more than double what is currently used in irrigation .
we also have to bear in mind that the availability of new fertile land in humid areas for rain-fed farming is extremely limited .
recent studies , as part of the comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture , have indicated that we will not be able to produce all the food , feed and fibre required in 2050 unless we improve the way we manage water .
invest and survive a few years ago , the international water management institute -lrb- iwmi -rrb- demonstrated that many countries are facing severe water scarcity , either as a result of a lack of available freshwater , or as a consequence of a lack of investment in infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs . "
current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time " what makes matters worse is that this scarcity predominantly affects developing countries where the majority of the world 's 840 million undernourished people live .
however , there are potential solutions .
these include more water storage , improved management of irrigation systems and increasing water productivity in irrigated and rain-fed farming systems .
all of these will require investment in knowledge , infrastructure and human capacity .
better water storage has to be considered .
ethiopia , which is typical of many sub-saharan african countries , has a storage capacity of 38 cubic metres per person .
in contrast , australia has almost 5,000 cubic metres per person , an amount that in the face of current climate change impacts may be inadequate .
whilst there will be a need for new large and medium-sized dams to deal with this critical lack of storage in africa , other simpler solutions will also be part of the equation .
these include the construction of small reservoirs , sustainable use of groundwater systems including artificial groundwater recharge , and rainwater harvesting for smallholder vegetable gardens .
improved year-round access to water will help farmers maintain their own food security using simple supplementary irrigation techniques .
the redesign of both the physical and institutional arrangements of some large and often dysfunctional irrigation schemes will also bring the required productivity increases .
safe , risk-free re-use of wastewater from growing cities will also be needed .
of course , these actions need to be paralleled by development of drought-tolerant crops , and the provision of infrastructure and facilities to get fresh food to markets .
resource competition since the formulation of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , much of the water agenda has been focused around the provision of drinking water and sanitation .
this puts demand on the same resources as agricultural water ; and as we urbanise and improve living standards , increasing competition for drinking water from domestic and other urban users will put agriculture under further pressure .
while improving drinking water and sanitation is vital with respect to health and living standards , we can not afford to neglect the provision and improved productivity of water for agriculture .
current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time , by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis .
just as in other areas of agricultural research and development , investment in the provision and better management of water resources has declined steadily since the green revolution .
my water science colleagues and i are raising a warning flag that significant investment in both research and development and water infrastructure development is needed if dire consequences are to be avoided . "

the article made no mention of the great inefficiency of growing and slaughtering animals for protein ; their feed , over their lifespans , requires a great deal of water .
vegetable protein requires much less , perhaps one-tenth , -lrb- or even less -rrb- water .
vegetarians have a point or two .
nicholas bodley , waltham , mass . , usa the planet will survive but it may have to wipe a great many of us out to do it .

i agree with a previous comment made , i do n't think the leaders of the world will act fast enough and many of us will die - but in the end our numbers will be healthier and the planet will eventually recover .
r. eagleton , austin , texas usa we must start to use water more efficiently and prevent water-waste in the home .
spain is already having problems producing enough veg from its limited water supply .
topveg , uk the one thing that we seem to ignore is the fact that all of the farm animals we raise use up water .
lots of it .
according to a university of california study , raising 1 lb of vegetables uses 25 gallons of water , 1 lb of beef uses 5214 gallons of water .
furthermore , it is very often farm effluent that is polluting our streams and contaminating our groundwater .
for me , the solution to our water crisis is simple - consume a vegetarian or vegan diet .
richard howard , chiang mai , thailand it is absolutely clear that population control underpins all efforts of the human race to survive - so why will no one discuss it ?
we need to control ourselves or nature will do it for us causing untold misery in the process. sam , salisbury australia 's food crisis is here now : rising population , depleted aquifers , dysfunctional dams , cropland degradation and rising oil costs .
there 's insufficient available water to support irrigated industrial agriculture now and this will significantly worsen .
for western australia , a wheat growing region of global importance , the sudden 15 % reduction in rainfall in the late 1970 's equated to a 60 % increase in evaporation from croplands and dams .
now our murray-darling basin is dead this country has lost 40 % of its fresh fruit and vegetables - all irrigated crops .
organic farming can sequester 70 % of australian annual co2 emissions , build stronger soil , supply nutritious food , and use 40 % of the oil currently used to grow industrial food .
it 's transition time folks !

monica , seattle , usa this " water crisis " is very much unlike the " climate crisis " .
water availability and its management are concepts that are well understood .
there is no need for politicians to put faith in dubious computer models to understand these issues .
they will not need to put their faith in yet to be perfected technologies nor risk taking unilateral action without any guarantee that other governments will follow suit .
governments will see a payback on investment in water infrastructure and be making a popular and tangible contribution to the well-being of their people in addition to helping solve a " world " problem .
for these reasons there is a good chance that that appropriate measures will be taken .
g gaskell , michigan usa one important - and very obvious fact - was omitted ... the critical need to get global warming under control that will otherwise drastically change rain patterns and expand deserts .
this includes the urgent need to stop the destruction of forests which not only act as natural generators and reservoirs of most of the world 's water , but hold immense amounts of carbon that are released as they are razed and burnt .
combine this with the also very obvious issue of limiting population growth and , just perhaps , humanity has a chance at preserving some level of quality of life .
otherwise , i see a very bleak and difficult future .
continued destruction of our remaining intact ecosystems , such as forests , is nothing less than humanity 's signature on a suicide note .
jf chalmers , toronto , canada i would agree with both john yaya and gordon stanger : there is an enormous wastage of water .
this contributes to economic water scarcity .
the number of countries that will face ' real ' physical water scarcity will remain very small .
these also happen to be oil and gas rich countries which have money to spend on desalination .
the biggest improvement that can be made , however , is by restoring the water retention capacity of soils , through biochar .
this is so because of all economic sectors , agriculture uses up most water , by far .
putting biochar into soils can slash the amount of water needed to irrigate crops dramatically .
many other water / soil management techniques exist , but the question is whether they can be implemented fast enough and on a wide enough scale .
laurens rademakers , brussels , belgium what about going into the asteroid field and finding a cubic mile of fresh water -lrb- mixed with rock and such , of course -rrb- .
that would satisfy earthly needs for awhile .

steve macdonald , ottawa , canada when will anyone or any government finally address the catholic church about its views on contraceptives ?
all of our earth crises now are compounded tremendously by our ever increasing population growth .
we can not find a way to have more people living better , more people simply means bigger problems for the forseeable future .
we need to slow down growth in order to begin to get a handle on our current situation .
r. fuentes , decatur , ga usa " population growth over the next four decades will see the number of people in the world increase from 6.5 billion up to 9.0 billion " - this statement , or something similar , is often repeated as if this is something we have to accept .
if we do , then all the technical fixes in the world are not going to save us - the world can not support 9 billion people - and will not .
ultimately if we do nothing about it - and it looks as if we will not - then we will suffer the same fate as all plague species - massive population collapse due to lack of resources .
karl , nottingham i dont really agree with that.for myself the water is something that we can not make sure that is gonna be finished one day , its impossible to control its amount of water.i mean , to control the environmental polluiton , yes , that's what intelligent human being should do !

nathalie tafelmacher , london , gb the future major life threatening crisis the world will face will be the water availability crisis .oil supplies may run out but there will always be alternatives to take its place but for a lack of water there is no alternative .one must remember the amount of water on earth today is the same amount that we had during the age of the dinosaurs it is just found in different physical forms and in different locations .unfortunately , these different locations are not where it is needed most .
the word usable is the key word here .many areas of the world have water but it is not usable .. salt water and contaminated can not be used to grow crops support livestock .potable water must be available humans to live in the areas that they now inhabit if water is not available then they must move or die .
will this stem the next major migration of the human race .i have see countless countries on my travels allow their precious water reserves to slip away almost within ! the blink of an eye .
uncontrolled deforestation , wasteful agricultural practices coupled with explosive relentless urban development has diminished the usable water supplies of many countries if you can not move to a new water supply like our ancestors did when available water ran out then you will did .until humans learn to treat water as the most precious ingredient needed to maintain life on planet earth then we will forever be held hostage by its availability.presently , wars are being fought in the oil rich areas of the world to keep its supply flowing , if the world 's future " oil " becomes water where will the next wars be fought ?
nothing lives without usable water ... will it become worth dying for more so than oil ? skip nieman , ottawa canada unless , as a species , we acknowledge that over population is the root cause of all survival problems on planet earth we are doomed .
its not necessary for billions to die a horrible death if we would just act to constrain the relentless population rise .
bruno wallenburg , sunbury , ohio usa certainly he is.india is using ground water , from deep bore wells , for all it 's agricultural irrigation.insufficient rains falls there to replenish it so starvation will result if no action.china 's river are so polluted that one understands they can not be treated to make water drinkable , or usable on crops !
thus there is a large market for those specialist companies in water management alastair clarke , leamington spa uk " matter is neither created nor destroyed " so goes the scientific saying .
yes , food production and life of the more than 9 billion people in 40 years to come will depend greatly on investment in water harvesting and storgae facilities .
planet earth has a stock of over 1,384,120,000 cubic kilometers of water involved in the hydrological cycle .
the nine -lrb- 9 -rrb- billion people by the year 2048 will need about 45,000 cubic kilometers at 5,000 cubic meters storage capacity per person of the 225,000 cubic kilometers of the surface freshwater that can be replenished through the hydrological cycle .
yes , there is need to worry in the absence of investment in water harvesting and storage facilities .
faustino faustino l. orach-meza , entebbe , uganda yes , water for food is critical , but in most developing countries there is still chronic wastage of water , hopelessly dysfunctional water resources management , blatant and pervasive corruption , out-of-control population growth , and lack of political will -lrb- plenty of pc platitudes , but minimal and ineffective investment -rrb- .
unless these problems are robustly dealt with , there is no hope , and the poor will starve .
gordon stanger , -lrb- currently -rrb- jaipur , rajasthan , india the bbc ignored the real storage solution to water which is to increase the amount of carbon in soils .
soils with more carbon percolate more water to groundwater recharge as well as holding more water in the soil zone longer .
both pasture management and the addition of biochar , charred agricultural waste , to the soil are ways to effectively increase soil carbon .
as a final bonus soils with more carbon have higher yields in both crops and biomass .
john yaya , chico , ca. yes we need to manage water supply better .but colin chartres and co have to realize that every coutry must also have a sustainable population , its not rocket science .
we can not keep populating ad infinitum and they should have the guts to say so p.stowasser , marlborough , nz i do n't expect the ineffectual governments of the world to do anything meaningful about this .
so , the world is in deep doo-doo .

governments should be ramping up efforts to make sure we have enough to grow crops as well as enough to drink , he argues .
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it this year , the world and , in particular , developing countries and the poor have been hit by both food and energy crises .
as a consequence , prices for many staple foods have risen by up to 100 % .
when we examine the causes of the food crisis , there are many contributing factors : a growing population , changes in trade patterns , urbanisation , dietary habits , biofuel production , climate change and regional droughts .
thus , we have a classic increase in prices as a result of high demand and low supply .
however , few commentators specifically mention the declining availability of water that is needed to grow irrigated and rain-fed crops .
according to some , the often mooted solution to the food crisis lies in plant breeding that produces the ultimate high yielding , low water-consuming crops .
while this solution is important , it will fail unless attention is paid to where the water for all the food , fibre and energy crops is going to come from .
thirsty world the causes of water scarcity are essentially identical to those of the food crisis .
there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries .
human needs for water have to be balanced against nature 's needs population growth over the next four decades will see the number of people in the world increase from 6.5 billion up to 9.0 billion .
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it .
so on average , we require between 2,000 and 3,000 litres of water per person to sustain our daily food requirements .
we will have 2.5 billion extra mouths to feed by 2050 , so finding the extra water each year will not be an easy task , given that it is more than double what is currently used in irrigation .
we also have to bear in mind that the availability of new fertile land in humid areas for rain-fed farming is extremely limited .
recent studies , as part of the comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture , have indicated that we will not be able to produce all the food , feed and fibre required in 2050 unless we improve the way we manage water .
invest and survive a few years ago , the international water management institute -lrb- iwmi -rrb- demonstrated that many countries are facing severe water scarcity , either as a result of a lack of available freshwater , or as a consequence of a lack of investment in infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs .
current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time what makes matters worse is that this scarcity predominantly affects developing countries where the majority of the world 's 840 million undernourished people live .
however , there are potential solutions .
these include more water storage , improved management of irrigation systems and increasing water productivity in irrigated and rain-fed farming systems .
all of these will require investment in knowledge , infrastructure and human capacity .
better water storage has to be considered .
ethiopia , which is typical of many sub-saharan african countries , has a storage capacity of 38 cubic metres per person .
in contrast , australia has almost 5,000 cubic metres per person , an amount that in the face of current climate change impacts may be inadequate .
whilst there will be a need for new large and medium-sized dams to deal with this critical lack of storage in africa , other simpler solutions will also be part of the equation .
governments should make sure water infrastructure is up to standard these include the construction of small reservoirs , sustainable use of groundwater systems including artificial groundwater recharge , and rainwater harvesting for smallholder vegetable gardens .
improved year-round access to water will help farmers maintain their own food security using simple supplementary irrigation techniques .
the redesign of both the physical and institutional arrangements of some large and often dysfunctional irrigation schemes will also bring the required productivity increases .
safe , risk-free re-use of wastewater from growing cities will also be needed .
of course , these actions need to be paralleled by development of drought-tolerant crops , and the provision of infrastructure and facilities to get fresh food to markets .
resource competition since the formulation of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , much of the water agenda has been focused around the provision of drinking water and sanitation .
this puts demand on the same resources as agricultural water ; and as we urbanise and improve living standards , increasing competition for drinking water from domestic and other urban users will put agriculture under further pressure .
while improving drinking water and sanitation is vital with respect to health and living standards , we can not afford to neglect the provision and improved productivity of water for agriculture .
many communities are still struggling to gain enough clean water current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time , by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis .
just as in other areas of agricultural research and development , investment in the provision and better management of water resources has declined steadily since the green revolution .

governments should be ramping up efforts to make sure we have enough to grow crops as well as enough to drink , he argues .
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it this year , the world and , in particular , developing countries and the poor have been hit by both food and energy crises .
as a consequence , prices for many staple foods have risen by up to 100 % .
when we examine the causes of the food crisis , there are many contributing factors : a growing population , changes in trade patterns , urbanisation , dietary habits , biofuel production , climate change and regional droughts .
thus , we have a classic increase in prices as a result of high demand and low supply .
however , few commentators specifically mention the declining availability of water that is needed to grow irrigated and rain-fed crops .
according to some , the often mooted solution to the food crisis lies in plant breeding that produces the ultimate high yielding , low water-consuming crops .
while this solution is important , it will fail unless attention is paid to where the water for all the food , fibre and energy crops is going to come from .
thirsty world the causes of water scarcity are essentially identical to those of the food crisis .
there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries .
human needs for water have to be balanced against nature 's needs population growth over the next four decades will see the number of people in the world increase from 6.5 billion up to 9.0 billion .
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it .
so on average , we require between 2,000 and 3,000 litres of water per person to sustain our daily food requirements .
we will have 2.5 billion extra mouths to feed by 2050 , so finding the extra water each year will not be an easy task , given that it is more than double what is currently used in irrigation .
we also have to bear in mind that the availability of new fertile land in humid areas for rain-fed farming is extremely limited .
recent studies , as part of the comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture , have indicated that we will not be able to produce all the food , feed and fibre required in 2050 unless we improve the way we manage water .
invest and survive a few years ago , the international water management institute -lrb- iwmi -rrb- demonstrated that many countries are facing severe water scarcity , either as a result of a lack of available freshwater , or as a consequence of a lack of investment in infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs .
current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time what makes matters worse is that this scarcity predominantly affects developing countries where the majority of the world 's 840 million undernourished people live .
however , there are potential solutions .
these include more water storage , improved management of irrigation systems and increasing water productivity in irrigated and rain-fed farming systems .
all of these will require investment in knowledge , infrastructure and human capacity .
better water storage has to be considered .
ethiopia , which is typical of many sub-saharan african countries , has a storage capacity of 38 cubic metres per person .
in contrast , australia has almost 5,000 cubic metres per person , an amount that in the face of current climate change impacts may be inadequate .
whilst there will be a need for new large and medium-sized dams to deal with this critical lack of storage in africa , other simpler solutions will also be part of the equation .
governments should make sure water infrastructure is up to standard these include the construction of small reservoirs , sustainable use of groundwater systems including artificial groundwater recharge , and rainwater harvesting for smallholder vegetable gardens .
improved year-round access to water will help farmers maintain their own food security using simple supplementary irrigation techniques .
the redesign of both the physical and institutional arrangements of some large and often dysfunctional irrigation schemes will also bring the required productivity increases .
safe , risk-free re-use of wastewater from growing cities will also be needed .
of course , these actions need to be paralleled by development of drought-tolerant crops , and the provision of infrastructure and facilities to get fresh food to markets .
resource competition since the formulation of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , much of the water agenda has been focused around the provision of drinking water and sanitation .
this puts demand on the same resources as agricultural water ; and as we urbanise and improve living standards , increasing competition for drinking water from domestic and other urban users will put agriculture under further pressure .
while improving drinking water and sanitation is vital with respect to health and living standards , we can not afford to neglect the provision and improved productivity of water for agriculture .
many communities are still struggling to gain enough clean water current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time , by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis .
just as in other areas of agricultural research and development , investment in the provision and better management of water resources has declined steadily since the green revolution .
my water science colleagues and i are raising a warning flag that significant investment in both research and development and water infrastructure development is needed if dire consequences are to be avoided .
dr colin chartres is director-general of the sri lanka-based international water management institute -lrb- iwmi -rrb- , a not-for-profit research organisation focusing on the sustainable management of water resources for food , livelihoods and the environment to read the summary of " water for food , water for life " , visit http : / / www.iwmi.cgiar.org / assessment the green room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with colin chartres ?
is the availability of water likely to constrain increases in food production ?
are governments doing enough to safeguard the supply and encourage economy ?
how should we prioritise drinking water , sanitation and the needs of agriculture ?
the article made no mention of the great inefficiency of growing and slaughtering animals for protein ; their feed , over their lifespans , requires a great deal of water .
vegetable protein requires much less , perhaps one-tenth , -lrb- or even less -rrb- water .
vegetarians have a point or two .
nicholas bodley , waltham , mass . , usa the planet will survive but it may have to wipe a great many of us out to do it .
in order to keep our numbers healthy , mother earth will weed out the sick and overly numerous in whatever ways she can - natural disasters , diseases and wars among the top methods .
i agree with a previous comment made , i do n't think the leaders of the world will act fast enough and many of us will die - but in the end our numbers will be healthier and the planet will eventually recover .
r. eagleton , austin , texas usa we must start to use water more efficiently and prevent water-waste in the home .
spain is already having problems producing enough veg from its limited water supply .
topveg , uk the one thing that we seem to ignore is the fact that all of the farm animals we raise use up water .
lots of it .
according to a university of california study , raising 1 lb of vegetables uses 25 gallons of water , 1 lb of beef uses 5214 gallons of water .
furthermore , it is very often farm effluent that is polluting our streams and contaminating our groundwater .
for me , the solution to our water crisis is simple - consume a vegetarian or vegan diet .
richard howard , chiang mai , thailand it is absolutely clear that population control underpins all efforts of the human race to survive - so why will no one discuss it ?
we need to control ourselves or nature will do it for us causing untold misery in the process. sam , salisbury australia 's food crisis is here now : rising population , depleted aquifers , dysfunctional dams , cropland degradation and rising oil costs .
there 's insufficient available water to support irrigated industrial agriculture now and this will significantly worsen .
for western australia , a wheat growing region of global importance , the sudden 15 % reduction in rainfall in the late 1970 's equated to a 60 % increase in evaporation from croplands and dams .
now our murray-darling basin is dead this country has lost 40 % of its fresh fruit and vegetables - all irrigated crops .
organic farming can sequester 70 % of australian annual co2 emissions , build stronger soil , supply nutritious food , and use 40 % of the oil currently used to grow industrial food .
it 's transition time folks !
jerry coleby-williams , brisbane , australia simple solution : pay people to not reproduce !
if every couple had only one child -lrb- or even better , no children at all , if that was their wish -rrb- this seemingly inevitable human population crisis would never be arise .
not everyone wants to be a parent .
most men do not dream of becoming fathers and increasing numbers of single women feel the same .
were the world 's current population to be halved tomorrow , think of how much better off all of us would be .
monica , seattle , usa this " water crisis " is very much unlike the " climate crisis " .
water availability and its management are concepts that are well understood .
there is no need for politicians to put faith in dubious computer models to understand these issues .
they will not need to put their faith in yet to be perfected technologies nor risk taking unilateral action without any guarantee that other governments will follow suit .
governments will see a payback on investment in water infrastructure and be making a popular and tangible contribution to the well-being of their people in addition to helping solve a " world " problem .
for these reasons there is a good chance that that appropriate measures will be taken .
g gaskell , michigan usa one important - and very obvious fact - was omitted ... the critical need to get global warming under control that will otherwise drastically change rain patterns and expand deserts .
this includes the urgent need to stop the destruction of forests which not only act as natural generators and reservoirs of most of the world 's water , but hold immense amounts of carbon that are released as they are razed and burnt .
combine this with the also very obvious issue of limiting population growth and , just perhaps , humanity has a chance at preserving some level of quality of life .
otherwise , i see a very bleak and difficult future .
continued destruction of our remaining intact ecosystems , such as forests , is nothing less than humanity 's signature on a suicide note .
jf chalmers , toronto , canada i would agree with both john yaya and gordon stanger : there is an enormous wastage of water .
this contributes to economic water scarcity .
the number of countries that will face ' real ' physical water scarcity will remain very small .
these also happen to be oil and gas rich countries which have money to spend on desalination .
the biggest improvement that can be made , however , is by restoring the water retention capacity of soils , through biochar .
this is so because of all economic sectors , agriculture uses up most water , by far .
putting biochar into soils can slash the amount of water needed to irrigate crops dramatically .
many other water / soil management techniques exist , but the question is whether they can be implemented fast enough and on a wide enough scale .
laurens rademakers , brussels , belgium what about going into the asteroid field and finding a cubic mile of fresh water -lrb- mixed with rock and such , of course -rrb- .
that would satisfy earthly needs for awhile .
remember , the gravitational gradient is down .
towing it into earth orbit would not be too difficult .
to get it to earth , either shuttles could be used -lrb- very inefficient -rrb- or you could hook it up to a miles high vertical cable , in small chunks , attached to the ground , and let gravity do the rest .
steve macdonald , ottawa , canada when will anyone or any government finally address the catholic church about its views on contraceptives ?
all of our earth crises now are compounded tremendously by our ever increasing population growth .
we can not find a way to have more people living better , more people simply means bigger problems for the forseeable future .
we need to slow down growth in order to begin to get a handle on our current situation .
r. fuentes , decatur , ga usa " population growth over the next four decades will see the number of people in the world increase from 6.5 billion up to 9.0 billion " - this statement , or something similar , is often repeated as if this is something we have to accept .
if we do , then all the technical fixes in the world are not going to save us - the world can not support 9 billion people - and will not .
ultimately if we do nothing about it - and it looks as if we will not - then we will suffer the same fate as all plague species - massive population collapse due to lack of resources .
karl , nottingham i dont really agree with that.for myself the water is something that we can not make sure that is gonna be finished one day , its impossible to control its amount of water.i mean , to control the environmental polluiton , yes , that's what intelligent human being should do !
i agree during the population growth would damage completely those future lives if we do not educate ourselves following education to the others to come.be attention to the potential solutions , please. wellington bastos junior , joinville brazil ' unless these problems are robustly dealt with , there is no hope , and the poor will starve .
gordon stanger , -lrb- currently -rrb- jaipur , rajasthan , india ' the poor are already starving -lrb- even the not quite so poor now -rrb- , yet there is still not the political will to address the problem .
polititians still waltz around in government properties , exclusive golf clubs , private estates & hotels all with free flowing fountains and lush gardens , whilst their people die on the back steps of those ' haunts of the elite ' from lack of the basic necesities of life .
this tells you all you need to know about the polititians and the economic policies of the world .
since most of the problems in the world today are caused by bickering polititians , the people of the world need to ask themselves sincerely ' do we still need polititians and their flawed economics-based politics , being paid for from the pocket of big business , yet still taxing the populous into destitution - until there are no more people able to afford the consumer culture that big business depends on ? '
free earth is the only way out .
jim , uk there is enough scientific proof .
i do n't know why governments , businesses and some individuals keep burying their heads in the sand .
according to some books , here are listed the main reason for past societal collapses .
there 's a lot to do , but we need to act now .
what are the governements waiting for ? what are we waiting for ?
deforestation and habitat destruction soil problems -lrb- erosion , salinization , and soil fertility losses -rrb- water management problems overhunting overfishing effects of introduced species on native species population growth increased per-capita impact of people human-caused climate change buildup of toxins in the environment energy shortages full human utilization of the earth 's photosynthetic capacity the world is in deep doh-dof indeed .
solutions : have less children -lrb- means available contraceptives / sexual health education / curbing some social and religious beliefs . -rrb-
consume less / lobby our shops , brands and governments to become sustainable become less dependent on oil -lrb- see transition towns initiative -rrb- read collapse by jared diamond .
nathalie tafelmacher , london , gb the future major life threatening crisis the world will face will be the water availability crisis .oil supplies may run out but there will always be alternatives to take its place but for a lack of water there is no alternative .one must remember the amount of water on earth today is the same amount that we had during the age of the dinosaurs it is just found in different physical forms and in different locations .unfortunately , these different locations are not where it is needed most .
the word usable is the key word here .many areas of the world have water but it is not usable .. salt water and contaminated can not be used to grow crops support livestock .potable water must be available humans to live in the areas that they now inhabit if water is not available then they must move or die .
will this stem the next major migration of the human race .i have see countless countries on my travels allow their precious water reserves to slip away almost within ! the blink of an eye .
uncontrolled deforestation , wasteful agricultural practices coupled with explosive relentless urban development has diminished the usable water supplies of many countries if you can not move to a new water supply like our ancestors did when available water ran out then you will did .until humans learn to treat water as the most precious ingredient needed to maintain life on planet earth then we will forever be held hostage by its availability.presently , wars are being fought in the oil rich areas of the world to keep its supply flowing , if the world 's future " oil " becomes water where will the next wars be fought ?
nothing lives without usable water ... will it become worth dying for more so than oil ? skip nieman , ottawa canada unless , as a species , we acknowledge that over population is the root cause of all survival problems on planet earth we are doomed .
its not necessary for billions to die a horrible death if we would just act to constrain the relentless population rise .
bruno wallenburg , sunbury , ohio usa certainly he is.india is using ground water , from deep bore wells , for all it 's agricultural irrigation.insufficient rains falls there to replenish it so starvation will result if no action.china 's river are so polluted that one understands they can not be treated to make water drinkable , or usable on crops !

faustino faustino l. orach-meza , entebbe , uganda yes , water for food is critical , but in most developing countries there is still chronic wastage of water , hopelessly dysfunctional water resources management , blatant and pervasive corruption , out-of-control population growth , and lack of political will -lrb- plenty of pc platitudes , but minimal and ineffective investment -rrb- .

gordon stanger , -lrb- currently -rrb- jaipur , rajasthan , india the bbc ignored the real storage solution to water which is to increase the amount of carbon in soils .
soils with more carbon percolate more water to groundwater recharge as well as holding more water in the soil zone longer .
both pasture management and the addition of biochar , charred agricultural waste , to the soil are ways to effectively increase soil carbon .
as a final bonus soils with more carbon have higher yields in both crops and biomass .

governments should be ramping up efforts to make sure we have enough to grow crops as well as enough to drink , he argues .
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it this year , the world and , in particular , developing countries and the poor have been hit by both food and energy crises .
as a consequence , prices for many staple foods have risen by up to 100 % .
when we examine the causes of the food crisis , there are many contributing factors : a growing population , changes in trade patterns , urbanisation , dietary habits , biofuel production , climate change and regional droughts .
thus , we have a classic increase in prices as a result of high demand and low supply .
however , few commentators specifically mention the declining availability of water that is needed to grow irrigated and rain-fed crops .
according to some , the often mooted solution to the food crisis lies in plant breeding that produces the ultimate high yielding , low water-consuming crops .
while this solution is important , it will fail unless attention is paid to where the water for all the food , fibre and energy crops is going to come from .
thirsty world the causes of water scarcity are essentially identical to those of the food crisis .
there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries .
human needs for water have to be balanced against nature 's needs population growth over the next four decades will see the number of people in the world increase from 6.5 billion up to 9.0 billion .
essentially , every calorie of food requires a litre of water to produce it .
so on average , we require between 2,000 and 3,000 litres of water per person to sustain our daily food requirements .
we will have 2.5 billion extra mouths to feed by 2050 , so finding the extra water each year will not be an easy task , given that it is more than double what is currently used in irrigation .
we also have to bear in mind that the availability of new fertile land in humid areas for rain-fed farming is extremely limited .
recent studies , as part of the comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture , have indicated that we will not be able to produce all the food , feed and fibre required in 2050 unless we improve the way we manage water .
invest and survive a few years ago , the international water management institute -lrb- iwmi -rrb- demonstrated that many countries are facing severe water scarcity , either as a result of a lack of available freshwater , or as a consequence of a lack of investment in infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs .
current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time what makes matters worse is that this scarcity predominantly affects developing countries where the majority of the world 's 840 million undernourished people live .
however , there are potential solutions .
these include more water storage , improved management of irrigation systems and increasing water productivity in irrigated and rain-fed farming systems .
all of these will require investment in knowledge , infrastructure and human capacity .
better water storage has to be considered .
ethiopia , which is typical of many sub-saharan african countries , has a storage capacity of 38 cubic metres per person .
in contrast , australia has almost 5,000 cubic metres per person , an amount that in the face of current climate change impacts may be inadequate .
whilst there will be a need for new large and medium-sized dams to deal with this critical lack of storage in africa , other simpler solutions will also be part of the equation .
governments should make sure water infrastructure is up to standard these include the construction of small reservoirs , sustainable use of groundwater systems including artificial groundwater recharge , and rainwater harvesting for smallholder vegetable gardens .
improved year-round access to water will help farmers maintain their own food security using simple supplementary irrigation techniques .
the redesign of both the physical and institutional arrangements of some large and often dysfunctional irrigation schemes will also bring the required productivity increases .
safe , risk-free re-use of wastewater from growing cities will also be needed .
of course , these actions need to be paralleled by development of drought-tolerant crops , and the provision of infrastructure and facilities to get fresh food to markets .
resource competition since the formulation of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , much of the water agenda has been focused around the provision of drinking water and sanitation .
this puts demand on the same resources as agricultural water ; and as we urbanise and improve living standards , increasing competition for drinking water from domestic and other urban users will put agriculture under further pressure .
while improving drinking water and sanitation is vital with respect to health and living standards , we can not afford to neglect the provision and improved productivity of water for agriculture .
many communities are still struggling to gain enough clean water current estimates indicate that we will not have enough water to feed ourselves in 40 years time , by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis .
just as in other areas of agricultural research and development , investment in the provision and better management of water resources has declined steadily since the green revolution .
my water science colleagues and i are raising a warning flag that significant investment in both research and development and water infrastructure development is needed if dire consequences are to be avoided .
dr colin chartres is director-general of the sri lanka-based international water management institute -lrb- iwmi -rrb- , a not-for-profit research organisation focusing on the sustainable management of water resources for food , livelihoods and the environment to read the summary of " water for food , water for life " , visit http : / / www.iwmi.cgiar.org / assessment the green room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with colin chartres ?
is the availability of water likely to constrain increases in food production ?
are governments doing enough to safeguard the supply and encourage economy ?
how should we prioritise drinking water , sanitation and the needs of agriculture ?

the nine -lrb- 9 -rrb- billion people by the year 2048 will need about 45,000 cubic kilometers at 5,000 cubic meters storage capacity per person of the 225,000 cubic kilometers of the surface freshwater that can be replenished through the hydrological cycle .
yes , there is need to worry in the absence of investment in water harvesting and storage facilities .
faustino faustino l. orach-meza , entebbe , uganda yes , water for food is critical , but in most developing countries there is still chronic wastage of water , hopelessly dysfunctional water resources management , blatant and pervasive corruption , out-of-control population growth , and lack of political will -lrb- plenty of pc platitudes , but minimal and ineffective investment -rrb- .
unless these problems are robustly dealt with , there is no hope , and the poor will starve .
gordon stanger , -lrb- currently -rrb- jaipur , rajasthan , india the bbc ignored the real storage solution to water which is to increase the amount of carbon in soils .
soils with more carbon percolate more water to groundwater recharge as well as holding more water in the soil zone longer .
both pasture management and the addition of biochar , charred agricultural waste , to the soil are ways to effectively increase soil carbon .
as a final bonus soils with more carbon have higher yields in both crops and biomass .
john yaya , chico , ca. yes we need to manage water supply better .but colin chartres and co have to realize that every coutry must also have a sustainable population , its not rocket science .
we can not keep populating ad infinitum and they should have the guts to say so p.stowasser , marlborough , nz i do n't expect the ineffectual governments of the world to do anything meaningful about this .
so , the world is in deep doo-doo .

community windpower ltd wants to erect the 20 turbines , each 413ft -lrb- 126m -rrb- high , at davidstow .
the company said this would be the best brown field site in the county , but opponents claim the area 's wildlife would suffer .
the meeting was called by the parish council to gauge public opinion .
of the parishioners who attended the meeting on wednesday night , only one spoke in favour of the development .
if the wind farm goes ahead it would be the largest in cornwall .
there are currently four wind farms already in operation in the county and a further four proposed .
