some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill .

but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .
the abuse therefore happened before the current data retention law .
nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" that damages our free social order . "

the eastern german state of saxony had put up guarantees of 2.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.24 billion -rrb- - a fifth of the state 's annual budget - for the bank in december .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .

further protests were planned for the headquarters of major supermarket chain aldi sued .
the demonstrations followed gatherings a day earlier , when farmers on tractors drove in a convoy from the headquarters of supermarket chain rewe , in the western city of cologne , to aldi nord in essen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers have now taken aim at retailers strikes and protests have been going on in germany for more than a week , with dairy farmers demanding higher prices and lower quotas for milk .
they have been joined in solidarity by farmers in some neighboring countries .
dairies are hit where it hurts the dairy farmers ' actions have hit dairies on the bottom line .
according to the head of the german milk industry federation -lrb- miv -rrb- , eberhard hetzner , losses have " certainly reached 50 million euros -lrb- $ 77 million -rrb- . "
this is due to production shortages from the ongoing strikes and blockades that have hit nearly half of the 110 dairies in germany , hetzner told the bild zeitung newspaper .
a number of dairies have demanded compensation for their losses .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say they 'd pay more - if farmers profit bdm spokesman franz grosse said he was optimistic that the dairies and farmers would come to an agreement .

the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .
no worries with wada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all natural substances are legal homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century by german samuel hahnemann and has been the subject of hot debate ever since .
scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "
alternative medicine chest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : captain michael ballack , r , just wears the number 13 for luck and homeopathic preparations are n't the only route german footballers choose in an attempt to keep their bodies running .
billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .

some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill . " this is uncharted territory in the law , " sebastian edathy , a social democrat and chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , told german public broadcaster zdf .
edathy called for sections of the law related to online searches to be limited to four or five years in order to give lawmakers a chance for evaluation .
he also said that the law could be made " more citizen friendly " than proposed by schaeuble . " we do n't want a spy state , " he said .
" we want a state that works with tweezers instead of a sledgehammer in cases where we indeed have to protect the state 's security concerns . " social democrats and members of germany 's opposition parties also reject dragnet searches that would be part of the package .
such dragnet searches would allow investigators to search people based on their religion . schaeuble meanwhile said that critics within the coalition were " insular voices " and added that the law had the backing of a large number of social democrats in parliament . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol . " " we have to find a solution for fuel that is compatible with european union -lrb- rules -rrb- , " said pierre d 'acunto , a french protester . officials from the eu 's executive , the commission , say there are " no short term solutions " to the problem of soaring fuel prices , insisting instead that fishing fleets should restructure rather than demand aid . " any specific remedy should reflect long-term structural problems and should not run counter to them , " said commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . are ships the problem ? last week , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said european fisheries would only have a future if member states , industry and the eu executive worked together to create " smaller , more fuel-efficient fleets . " fishermen across europe have staged demonstrations in protest at soaring fuel prices , which the commission says has pushed the price of marine diesel up by 240 percent since 2004 . the commission , which is responsible for setting annual limits on the amount and type of fish which eu fishermen catch , regularly comes under fire from the fishing industry , which accuses the brussels body of setting unfairly low quotas and overloading it with complex legislation . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol . " " we have to find a solution for fuel that is compatible with european union -lrb- rules -rrb- , " said pierre d 'acunto , a french protester . officials from the eu 's executive , the commission , say there are " no short term solutions " to the problem of soaring fuel prices , insisting instead that fishing fleets should restructure rather than demand aid .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .
so for the time being , it remains unclear how or with whom the social democrats plan to stop what 's become a dizzying free-fall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only german chancellor angela merkel and russian prime minister vladimir putin were absent from the talks in the latvian capital , riga . the cbss plans a series of reforms aimed at promoting safer environmental and economic development in the region , danish prime minister andres fogh rasmussen said . speaking to reporters , poland 's prime minister donald tusk reiterated his country 's opposition to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- pipeline expected to link vyborg in russia with germany 's greifswald via the baltic sea . " we believe that the gas transfer by land would be cheaper and more effective , " he said . pipeline protests finland and sweden joined poland and the three baltic states in their criticism of the nord stream pipeline , which is backed by russian gas monopoly giant gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall , citing environmental and safety concerns . the council , whose members include the european commission , plans to focus on the environment , economic development , energy , the fight against human trafficking and nuclear security , the prime ministers said in a statement . the organization was established 15 years ago to promote a stable , democratic europe at the time when some of its members had broken away from the soviet union and attempted to form their own democratic institutions . no longer needed ? since then all but two of its members have joined the european union and the council has faced accusations of being inefficient and irrelevant in modern-day europe . it is seeking to change this by refocusing on developing the eu 's external relations with non-members iceland , norway and russia . " without the eu the cbss would be naught , but also the eu needs this sort of regional cooperation .
in this sense , organizations like the cbss or the european dialogue in the mediterranean are essential for making eu policies work , " scandinavian expert vilhelm konnander told dpa news agency . denmark takes over the cbss 's presidency in july .

some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill . " this is uncharted territory in the law , " sebastian edathy , a social democrat and chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , told german public broadcaster zdf .
edathy called for sections of the law related to online searches to be limited to four or five years in order to give lawmakers a chance for evaluation .
he also said that the law could be made " more citizen friendly " than proposed by schaeuble . " we do n't want a spy state , " he said .
" we want a state that works with tweezers instead of a sledgehammer in cases where we indeed have to protect the state 's security concerns . " social democrats and members of germany 's opposition parties also reject dragnet searches that would be part of the package .
such dragnet searches would allow investigators to search people based on their religion . schaeuble meanwhile said that critics within the coalition were " insular voices " and added that the law had the backing of a large number of social democrats in parliament . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .
no worries with wada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all natural substances are legal homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century by german samuel hahnemann and has been the subject of hot debate ever since .
scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "
alternative medicine chest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : captain michael ballack , r , just wears the number 13 for luck and homeopathic preparations are n't the only route german footballers choose in an attempt to keep their bodies running .
billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .
but given germany 's relatively good rate of success in international tournaments , perhaps teams like england and the netherlands might want to give homeopathic doping a whirl . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .

pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "

nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' germans welcome obama 's choice of biden as vp nominee united states -pipe- 04.06.2008 world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision and brings people together ... "
senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .

"
senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .

association officials said that they had chosen the 63-year-old kiefer as " a world-renowned artist , who confronts his times with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and transitory . "
the judges said kiefer , whose sculptures include huge replica airplanes made of battered , corroded lead , had evolved imagery " that makes the viewer feel like a reader . "
he had also used the recognizable shape of books as a key element in his paintings .
" not only his installations , which constantly reference great texts , show the extent to which kiefer deals with literature and poetry - he has turned the book itself and its form into a decisive means of expression , " they said .
kiefer 's paintings and sculptures , displayed in leading contemporary art museums such as denmark 's louisiana , often have an anti-war message .
disturbing messenger the prize judges said kiefer , a student of german artist joseph beuys , had confronted society with the " disturbing message that all things die " and had posed the question whether germans can ever be artists again after the holocaust and nazi domination of the arts .
bildunterschrift : kiefer 's sculpture : book with wings the frankfurt peace prize , which comes with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,600 -rrb- , was first awarded in 1950 and usually goes to novelists , and sometimes to scholars , whose writings are deemed to improve understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
recent winners include historian saul friedlaender , sociologist wolf lepenies and turkish writer orhan pamuk .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?

only german chancellor angela merkel and russian prime minister vladimir putin were absent from the talks in the latvian capital , riga . the cbss plans a series of reforms aimed at promoting safer environmental and economic development in the region , danish prime minister andres fogh rasmussen said . speaking to reporters , poland 's prime minister donald tusk reiterated his country 's opposition to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- pipeline expected to link vyborg in russia with germany 's greifswald via the baltic sea . " we believe that the gas transfer by land would be cheaper and more effective , " he said . pipeline protests finland and sweden joined poland and the three baltic states in their criticism of the nord stream pipeline , which is backed by russian gas monopoly giant gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall , citing environmental and safety concerns . the council , whose members include the european commission , plans to focus on the environment , economic development , energy , the fight against human trafficking and nuclear security , the prime ministers said in a statement . the organization was established 15 years ago to promote a stable , democratic europe at the time when some of its members had broken away from the soviet union and attempted to form their own democratic institutions . no longer needed ? since then all but two of its members have joined the european union and the council has faced accusations of being inefficient and irrelevant in modern-day europe . it is seeking to change this by refocusing on developing the eu 's external relations with non-members iceland , norway and russia . " without the eu the cbss would be naught , but also the eu needs this sort of regional cooperation .
in this sense , organizations like the cbss or the european dialogue in the mediterranean are essential for making eu policies work , " scandinavian expert vilhelm konnander told dpa news agency . denmark takes over the cbss 's presidency in july .

only german chancellor angela merkel and russian prime minister vladimir putin were absent from the talks in the latvian capital , riga . the cbss plans a series of reforms aimed at promoting safer environmental and economic development in the region , danish prime minister andres fogh rasmussen said . speaking to reporters , poland 's prime minister donald tusk reiterated his country 's opposition to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- pipeline expected to link vyborg in russia with germany 's greifswald via the baltic sea . " we believe that the gas transfer by land would be cheaper and more effective , " he said . pipeline protests finland and sweden joined poland and the three baltic states in their criticism of the nord stream pipeline , which is backed by russian gas monopoly giant gazprom and german firms eon ruhrgas and basf / wintershall , citing environmental and safety concerns . the council , whose members include the european commission , plans to focus on the environment , economic development , energy , the fight against human trafficking and nuclear security , the prime ministers said in a statement . the organization was established 15 years ago to promote a stable , democratic europe at the time when some of its members had broken away from the soviet union and attempted to form their own democratic institutions . no longer needed ? since then all but two of its members have joined the european union and the council has faced accusations of being inefficient and irrelevant in modern-day europe . it is seeking to change this by refocusing on developing the eu 's external relations with non-members iceland , norway and russia . " without the eu the cbss would be naught , but also the eu needs this sort of regional cooperation .
in this sense , organizations like the cbss or the european dialogue in the mediterranean are essential for making eu policies work , " scandinavian expert vilhelm konnander told dpa news agency . denmark takes over the cbss 's presidency in july .

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol . " " we have to find a solution for fuel that is compatible with european union -lrb- rules -rrb- , " said pierre d 'acunto , a french protester . officials from the eu 's executive , the commission , say there are " no short term solutions " to the problem of soaring fuel prices , insisting instead that fishing fleets should restructure rather than demand aid . " any specific remedy should reflect long-term structural problems and should not run counter to them , " said commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . are ships the problem ? last week , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said european fisheries would only have a future if member states , industry and the eu executive worked together to create " smaller , more fuel-efficient fleets . " fishermen across europe have staged demonstrations in protest at soaring fuel prices , which the commission says has pushed the price of marine diesel up by 240 percent since 2004 . the commission , which is responsible for setting annual limits on the amount and type of fish which eu fishermen catch , regularly comes under fire from the fishing industry , which accuses the brussels body of setting unfairly low quotas and overloading it with complex legislation . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .

scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .

billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .

however , not all conference attendees were convinced .

" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .

support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .

"
senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill .

some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill . " this is uncharted territory in the law , " sebastian edathy , a social democrat and chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , told german public broadcaster zdf .
edathy called for sections of the law related to online searches to be limited to four or five years in order to give lawmakers a chance for evaluation .
he also said that the law could be made " more citizen friendly " than proposed by schaeuble . " we do n't want a spy state , " he said .
" we want a state that works with tweezers instead of a sledgehammer in cases where we indeed have to protect the state 's security concerns . " social democrats and members of germany 's opposition parties also reject dragnet searches that would be part of the package .
such dragnet searches would allow investigators to search people based on their religion . schaeuble meanwhile said that critics within the coalition were " insular voices " and added that the law had the backing of a large number of social democrats in parliament . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 04.06.2008 parliament debates data retention in wake of telekom scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the telekom kept too close an eye - and ear - on its workers a week after it emerged that the telecoms giant had spied on its own employees , german mps discussed what lawmakers could do to protect people from illegal surveillance .
but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .
the abuse therefore happened before the current data retention law .
nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" that damages our free social order . "
but schnappauf said also said he did not think changes in legislation were necessary . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : legislation is not the answer to the telekom scandal dw 's karl zawadzky believes the revelations of serious data abuses at deutsche telekom will dent the image of german business as a whole .
but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed .

but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .
the abuse therefore happened before the current data retention law .
nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" that damages our free social order . "
but schnappauf said also said he did not think changes in legislation were necessary . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : legislation is not the answer to the telekom scandal dw 's karl zawadzky believes the revelations of serious data abuses at deutsche telekom will dent the image of german business as a whole .
but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed .
-lrb- 02.06.2008 -rrb- german minister under fire over telekom spying scandal the german interior minister has come under attack for failing to take a tough line against deutsche telekom for its breaches of data laws .
calls are growing for controls on the industry to be tightened up .
-lrb- 02.06.2008 -rrb- deutsche telekom boss blames others for spying the embattled boss of deutsche telekom has distanced himself from the snooping scandal , which targeted news leaks from inside the firm to journalists , by blaming " a few bad apples " at germany 's national phone company .

kiefer 's paintings and sculptures , displayed in leading contemporary art museums such as denmark 's louisiana , often have an anti-war message .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .

once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .

on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "

billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol . " " we have to find a solution for fuel that is compatible with european union -lrb- rules -rrb- , " said pierre d 'acunto , a french protester . officials from the eu 's executive , the commission , say there are " no short term solutions " to the problem of soaring fuel prices , insisting instead that fishing fleets should restructure rather than demand aid . " any specific remedy should reflect long-term structural problems and should not run counter to them , " said commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . are ships the problem ? last week , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said european fisheries would only have a future if member states , industry and the eu executive worked together to create " smaller , more fuel-efficient fleets . " fishermen across europe have staged demonstrations in protest at soaring fuel prices , which the commission says has pushed the price of marine diesel up by 240 percent since 2004 . the commission , which is responsible for setting annual limits on the amount and type of fish which eu fishermen catch , regularly comes under fire from the fishing industry , which accuses the brussels body of setting unfairly low quotas and overloading it with complex legislation . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .
no worries with wada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all natural substances are legal homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century by german samuel hahnemann and has been the subject of hot debate ever since .
scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "
alternative medicine chest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : captain michael ballack , r , just wears the number 13 for luck and homeopathic preparations are n't the only route german footballers choose in an attempt to keep their bodies running .
billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .
but given germany 's relatively good rate of success in international tournaments , perhaps teams like england and the netherlands might want to give homeopathic doping a whirl . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol . " " we have to find a solution for fuel that is compatible with european union -lrb- rules -rrb- , " said pierre d 'acunto , a french protester . officials from the eu 's executive , the commission , say there are " no short term solutions " to the problem of soaring fuel prices , insisting instead that fishing fleets should restructure rather than demand aid . " any specific remedy should reflect long-term structural problems and should not run counter to them , " said commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . are ships the problem ? last week , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said european fisheries would only have a future if member states , industry and the eu executive worked together to create " smaller , more fuel-efficient fleets . " fishermen across europe have staged demonstrations in protest at soaring fuel prices , which the commission says has pushed the price of marine diesel up by 240 percent since 2004 . the commission , which is responsible for setting annual limits on the amount and type of fish which eu fishermen catch , regularly comes under fire from the fishing industry , which accuses the brussels body of setting unfairly low quotas and overloading it with complex legislation . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .
no worries with wada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all natural substances are legal homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century by german samuel hahnemann and has been the subject of hot debate ever since .
scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "
alternative medicine chest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : captain michael ballack , r , just wears the number 13 for luck and homeopathic preparations are n't the only route german footballers choose in an attempt to keep their bodies running .
billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .
but given germany 's relatively good rate of success in international tournaments , perhaps teams like england and the netherlands might want to give homeopathic doping a whirl . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.06.2008 social democrats fall to historic low in public opinion polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is flagging badly in public opinion polls newspaper headlines on wednesday , june 4 , made for disturbing reading for germany 's social democrats .
their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .
so for the time being , it remains unclear how or with whom the social democrats plan to stop what 's become a dizzying free-fall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol . " " we have to find a solution for fuel that is compatible with european union -lrb- rules -rrb- , " said pierre d 'acunto , a french protester . officials from the eu 's executive , the commission , say there are " no short term solutions " to the problem of soaring fuel prices , insisting instead that fishing fleets should restructure rather than demand aid . " any specific remedy should reflect long-term structural problems and should not run counter to them , " said commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . are ships the problem ? last week , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said european fisheries would only have a future if member states , industry and the eu executive worked together to create " smaller , more fuel-efficient fleets . " fishermen across europe have staged demonstrations in protest at soaring fuel prices , which the commission says has pushed the price of marine diesel up by 240 percent since 2004 . the commission , which is responsible for setting annual limits on the amount and type of fish which eu fishermen catch , regularly comes under fire from the fishing industry , which accuses the brussels body of setting unfairly low quotas and overloading it with complex legislation . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol . " " we have to find a solution for fuel that is compatible with european union -lrb- rules -rrb- , " said pierre d 'acunto , a french protester . officials from the eu 's executive , the commission , say there are " no short term solutions " to the problem of soaring fuel prices , insisting instead that fishing fleets should restructure rather than demand aid . " any specific remedy should reflect long-term structural problems and should not run counter to them , " said commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . are ships the problem ? last week , eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said european fisheries would only have a future if member states , industry and the eu executive worked together to create " smaller , more fuel-efficient fleets . " fishermen across europe have staged demonstrations in protest at soaring fuel prices , which the commission says has pushed the price of marine diesel up by 240 percent since 2004 . the commission , which is responsible for setting annual limits on the amount and type of fish which eu fishermen catch , regularly comes under fire from the fishing industry , which accuses the brussels body of setting unfairly low quotas and overloading it with complex legislation . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .
no worries with wada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all natural substances are legal homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century by german samuel hahnemann and has been the subject of hot debate ever since .
scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "
alternative medicine chest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : captain michael ballack , r , just wears the number 13 for luck and homeopathic preparations are n't the only route german footballers choose in an attempt to keep their bodies running .
billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .
but given germany 's relatively good rate of success in international tournaments , perhaps teams like england and the netherlands might want to give homeopathic doping a whirl . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 04.06.2008 parliament debates data retention in wake of telekom scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the telekom kept too close an eye - and ear - on its workers a week after it emerged that the telecoms giant had spied on its own employees , german mps discussed what lawmakers could do to protect people from illegal surveillance .
but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol .

"
senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .

some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill . " this is uncharted territory in the law , " sebastian edathy , a social democrat and chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , told german public broadcaster zdf .
edathy called for sections of the law related to online searches to be limited to four or five years in order to give lawmakers a chance for evaluation .
he also said that the law could be made " more citizen friendly " than proposed by schaeuble . " we do n't want a spy state , " he said .
" we want a state that works with tweezers instead of a sledgehammer in cases where we indeed have to protect the state 's security concerns . " social democrats and members of germany 's opposition parties also reject dragnet searches that would be part of the package .
such dragnet searches would allow investigators to search people based on their religion . schaeuble meanwhile said that critics within the coalition were " insular voices " and added that the law had the backing of a large number of social democrats in parliament . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill . " this is uncharted territory in the law , " sebastian edathy , a social democrat and chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , told german public broadcaster zdf .
edathy called for sections of the law related to online searches to be limited to four or five years in order to give lawmakers a chance for evaluation .
he also said that the law could be made " more citizen friendly " than proposed by schaeuble . " we do n't want a spy state , " he said .
" we want a state that works with tweezers instead of a sledgehammer in cases where we indeed have to protect the state 's security concerns . " social democrats and members of germany 's opposition parties also reject dragnet searches that would be part of the package .

27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .
the abuse therefore happened before the current data retention law .
nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .

police in anti-riot gear moved to disperse the crowd and used water cannons to extinguish burning banners . many of the surrounding streets were cordoned off with barbed wire . at least one policeman was slightly injured in the clashes , which took place while a delegation of about 30 fishermen was meeting eu officials . down with diesel the protesters have called for diesel prices to be reduced to 40 cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.62 -rrb- , with one italian banner reading : " we ca n't keep up with the pace of petrol .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .
no worries with wada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all natural substances are legal homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century by german samuel hahnemann and has been the subject of hot debate ever since .
scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "
alternative medicine chest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : captain michael ballack , r , just wears the number 13 for luck and homeopathic preparations are n't the only route german footballers choose in an attempt to keep their bodies running .
billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .
but given germany 's relatively good rate of success in international tournaments , perhaps teams like england and the netherlands might want to give homeopathic doping a whirl . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .

on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .

billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .

part of winning any championship is dealing with injuries - or avoiding them in the first place .
a new study shows that the german national team places unusual trust in natural healing over traditional medicine . soccer is no stranger to strange ideas about how to keep star players from getting hurt .
in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .
one of them , bayer leverkusen 's dieter trzolek , has even been nicknamed " the druid " - rather ironically since his employer is a team sponsored by an aspirin company .
no worries with wada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all natural substances are legal homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century by german samuel hahnemann and has been the subject of hot debate ever since .
scientific investigations have never found any healing benefits other than a placebo effect from taking preparations of things with colorful names like leopard 's bane , squirting cucumber or marsh tea .
on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "
alternative medicine chest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : captain michael ballack , r , just wears the number 13 for luck and homeopathic preparations are n't the only route german footballers choose in an attempt to keep their bodies running .
billigmann 's study found that some 60 percent of team doctors have prescribed acupuncture , and former national players patrick owomoyela and jan schlaudraff are reportedly clients of " self-healing management " guru holger fischer .
meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .
but given germany 's relatively good rate of success in international tournaments , perhaps teams like england and the netherlands might want to give homeopathic doping a whirl . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 04.06.2008 parliament debates data retention in wake of telekom scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the telekom kept too close an eye - and ear - on its workers a week after it emerged that the telecoms giant had spied on its own employees , german mps discussed what lawmakers could do to protect people from illegal surveillance .
but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .
the abuse therefore happened before the current data retention law .
nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" that damages our free social order . "
but schnappauf said also said he did not think changes in legislation were necessary . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : legislation is not the answer to the telekom scandal dw 's karl zawadzky believes the revelations of serious data abuses at deutsche telekom will dent the image of german business as a whole .
but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .
so for the time being , it remains unclear how or with whom the social democrats plan to stop what 's become a dizzying free-fall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .

2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .
so for the time being , it remains unclear how or with whom the social democrats plan to stop what 's become a dizzying free-fall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .
the abuse therefore happened before the current data retention law .
nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" that damages our free social order . "
but schnappauf said also said he did not think changes in legislation were necessary . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : legislation is not the answer to the telekom scandal dw 's karl zawadzky believes the revelations of serious data abuses at deutsche telekom will dent the image of german business as a whole .
but the business journalist does not think a change in the law is needed .

in 1998 , then england coach glenn hoddle took a faith healer to the world cup - to no avail , as england lost on penalties to argentina .
a study just published on how german soccer docs treat aches and pains has revealed that germany 's faith is in " homeopathic doping . "
the presumably objective study was carried out by an academic institute in koblenz at the behest of a leading manufacturer of homeopathic remedies .
it found that 92 percent of doctors who work for the bundesliga 's first- and second-division sides prescribed such cures .

on the other hand , players who take homeopathic remedies , unlike users of other chemical forms of physical rejuvenation , have no reason to fear anti-steroid checks .
" the success stories are impressive , " said peter billigmann , a sports doctor and the head of the institute that carried out the study , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" homeopathic substances do n't have any side effects , and we 're on the safe side where doping is concerned . "

meanwhile , germany defender marcell jansen is allegedly a fan of " kinesio tapes , " strips of porous cotton fabric with a medical grade acrylic adhesive that supposedly stimulate the body 's own healing functions .
whether the tapes and herbs and self-healing management processes have any effect on players ' abilities to curl in crosses or convert penalties will be a matter for future generations of sports-medicinal debate .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

" cut the grass . "
a seemingly innocuous message to most people .
but when the message came over kenyan airwaves , the kenya national commission on human rights became concerned . the independent rights organization had been monitoring local radio for hate speech in the run-up to the election on dec .
27 , 2007 .
and when callers to one kalenjin-language station said the people of the milk needed to cut the grass , the agency was paying attention .
instead of a simple note about trimming the landscape , the obscure message was calling for the forceful removal of the ethnic kikuyu from traditional kalenjin homelands in the rift valley .
with the memory of rwanda 's genocide still vivid , the message served as an eerie reminder of the role media might take in inciting violence .
in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

in rwanda 's case , radio broadcasts marked the beginning of an ethnic cleansing campaign that saw over 800,000 tutsis dead in 100 days .
could the hate-filled messages sent across kenyan airwaves have provoked something similar ?
reports coming out of the country in the aftermath to post-election violence that left 1,200 dead and over 350,000 displaced suggest that it did , although on a much smaller scale .
locals there speak of text messages sent via mobile phone , stirring people to kill their neighbors .
in the violence , the messages noted , the perpetrators would not be caught and persecuted .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoek believes a media watchdog group could prevent genocide though it 's difficult to say just how great a role the media played in kenya 's post-election violence , jan hoek , director-general of radio netherlands worldwide , sees the hostility there as a call for greater media monitoring .
" i 'd like to propose an international media monitoring system , " hoek told the audience at deutsche welle 's global media forum .
" newsflash : we can not prevent conflict , " he said , " but we can mitigate its consequences . "
the proposal hoek offered was to create a forward-looking watchdog group , one that might be better able to forewarn global entities about upcoming conflicts than a local agency could .
this multinational , unilateral organization would analyze media reports worldwide , pointing out potential areas of conflict both in " risk areas " and in relatively stable regions .
risk areas are those defined by the united states institute of peace -lrb- usip -rrb- as places where the threat to peace is particularly acute - places that now include afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , pakistan and zimbabwe .
by directing people - both news agencies and experts in conflict resolution and mediation - to these risk areas before conflicts escalate into crises , hoek believes that the international agency may just be able to prevent genocide .
a divided response those are big shoes to fill but several experts on hand at the conference agreed it was a good idea .
" it 's a practical proposal , " said armen oganesyan , director general of voice of russia .
stephen king , director of the bbc world service trust agreed .
" we need to take a proactive role in preventing conflict , " said king .
while the western media tends to doubt the influential role it plays , those in developing countries do n't doubt the power that media holds , he said .
" aid agencies use media to disseminate information to populations in crisis , " said vladimir bratic , assistant professor at hollins university , virginia , usa .
" we can do the same . "
however , not all conference attendees were convinced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. raghavachari doubts the effectivity of the proposal " with any organization like that you will run into problems , questions of differing national interests , " said prof. s. raghavachari , head of the broadcast journalism department at the indian institute of mass communication .
" this is disingenuous , " said jernali ulimwengu , a journalist with the tanzania-based newspaper raia mwema , who argued that western media have their own agenda .
" big corporate interests give them an axe to grind . "
" media has to earn its reputation , " radio netherlands ' hoek reminded the crowd .
with this organization acting as a neutral overseer , he said , a critical eye would be turned to media in developing and western countries alike .
hoek 's proposed body would look beyond fragile nations monitoring western media as well as being on the alert for potentially inflammatory comments - phrases such as " islamic terrorism " which could promote prejudice .
this monitoring , he said , is one of the best ways to counter hate media around the world .
still , questions about the proposed agency abound .

some think the changes are going too far . for the first time , the proposed legislation , which still needs to be approved by parliament , would give federal police officers the right to take preventive measures in cases of suspected terrorism . the bill calls for video surveillance of private apartments and online computer searches . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble defended the proposed law after the meeting . " it 's an important building block for germany 's security architecture , " he said , adding that the bill was in line with germany 's constitution . schaeuble 's plans led to fierce discussions within the coalition as the conservative minister mainly faced critique from his social democratic colleague justice minister brigitte zypries . zypries rejected , for example , plans to let investigators enter apartments to install surveillance programs on computers or surveillance cameras without the consent of the people who live there . uncharted territory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble -lrb- left -rrb- and zypries did n't see eye to eye on the bill while the two sides have managed to come to an agreement , members of zypries ' party have already voiced their concerns and have said that they will call for several changes to the bill . " this is uncharted territory in the law , " sebastian edathy , a social democrat and chairman of the parliament 's domestic affairs committee , told german public broadcaster zdf .
edathy called for sections of the law related to online searches to be limited to four or five years in order to give lawmakers a chance for evaluation .
he also said that the law could be made " more citizen friendly " than proposed by schaeuble . " we do n't want a spy state , " he said .
" we want a state that works with tweezers instead of a sledgehammer in cases where we indeed have to protect the state 's security concerns . " social democrats and members of germany 's opposition parties also reject dragnet searches that would be part of the package .
such dragnet searches would allow investigators to search people based on their religion . schaeuble meanwhile said that critics within the coalition were " insular voices " and added that the law had the backing of a large number of social democrats in parliament . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .

senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .

their support has dropped to a historic nadir of 20 percent .
there are many reasons for the plunge . the poll , which was carried out by germany leading opinion surveying organization , forsa , showed support for the spd had declined by three percentage points within a week .
2,501 likely voters were asked about their political preferences .
the poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
one short-term factor in the spd 's current decline may be the party 's decision to field its own candidate , academic gesine schwan , to challenge popular president horst koehler in next year 's federal assembly vote .
many germans see that move as a trial balloon for cooperating with the left party , the successor to the east german communist party .
the votes of the spd , the left and the greens would currently yield a parliamentary majority in the bundestag .
" many members of the electorate fear that her candidacy , despite reassurances from spd chairman kurt beck , will be a signal for cooperation with the left party on the national level , " forsa head manfred guellner told the newsmagazine stern .
beck 's schwan song ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's decision to back schwan 's candidacy seems to have backfired beck has insisted that his party will maintain its distance from the left , but voters are skeptical .
in a poll taken by the german public television station zdf , 60 percent of those asked said they did n't believe the party chairman on this issue .
moreover , only 15 percent of respondents in that survey said they wanted to see beck as the social democrats ' candidate in the next general election .
but the forsa poll also put support for the left party at 15 percent , its highest showing ever and 1 percent better than the previous week .
that suggests the spd is caught between a rock and a hard place .
left-leaning voters are deserting the party because it is not progressive enough , while moderate ones reject the very idea of a coalition with those on the far left .
manliness and members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many members have turned their backs on the spd the spd has long-term structural problems .
support from the party 's core working-class constituency has been declining for years amidst spd attempts to position itself in the political center .
the party is particular weak among men .
in the forsa survey , the spd polled only 17 percent among german men - the same as the left party and only half as well as the conservative cdu / csu .
experts say the party is also bleeding card-carrying members - traditionally one of its strengths .
" in a few days , we 'll likely be reading reports that , for the first time in its history , the cdu has more members than the party of kurt beck , " wrote political scientist franz walter in der spiegel newsmagazine as the forsa poll was made public .
no savior in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent local elections gave the spd no reason to cheer beck 's position at the head of the party is becoming increasingly disputed , but unfortunately for the spd , there are few alternatives .
the party has so far been unable to find a stable replacement for gerhard schroeder , the charismatic ex-chancellor who dominated the spd from 1998 to 2005 .
and with the retirement of former vice chancellor franz muentefering last year , the party lost one of its few leaders capable of stirring enthusiasm in its core constituents .

the eastern german state of saxony had put up guarantees of 2.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.24 billion -rrb- - a fifth of the state 's annual budget - for the bank in december .
this was meant to keep it from collapsing amid the bank 's sale to western german state bank lbbw .
savings banks also participated in the bailout by providing a liquidity facility of 17 billion euros .
" the commission is satisfied that these aid measures will restore the viability of sachsenlb without unduly distorting competition , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said in a statement , citing special regulations that allow public financial support to save and restructure companies in trouble .

but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .
the abuse therefore happened before the current data retention law .
nonetheless the scandal has damaged public confidence in the confidentiality with which their data is handled .
a poll commissioned by the television news station n24 found that 83 percent of those asked believed the telekom affair was not an isolated incident , and that 57 favored beefing up data-protection legislation .
leaders of industry also said they were concerned about the issue .
" with increasing data surveillance , the risks of abuse go up and trust in information-technology systems goes down , " said the director of the association of german industry , werner schnappauf , in an interview with the spiegel news magazine .
" that damages our free social order . "

but there was little agreement . telekom boss rené obermann may have announced additional training for employees about data retention laws , but that did little to cool the tone of the bundestag debate on wednesday , june 4 about the spying scandal .
all the major parties condemned the illegal surveillance at the telecommunications giant , with the left party 's petra pau going furthest , saying it amounted to an intentional violation of the german constitution .
but the partners in the governing grand coalition - the conservative cdu-csu and the social democrats - disagreed vehemently over whether anti-surveillance legislation needed to be bolstered to prevent similar incidents in future .
spd representative michael buersch called for the maximum fine in cases of misuse of personal data to be raised to 300,000 -lrb- $ 465,000 -rrb- .
" there is a real need for action that exists right now , " bürsch said .
but cdu legal expert juergen gehb rejected those ideas , as did conservative interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who said it would be better to engage companies in dialogue .
opposition against data retention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast said the amount of data stored should be drastically reduced meanwhile , the opposition called for the current data retention law , under which information about all telephone and internet connections in germany is saved for six months , to be scrapped .
pau said the legislation itself , and not the misuse of retained data , was the problem .
that position was seconded by the greens .
" we have to ensure that as few data as possible are saved , " said green parliamentary fraction leader renate kuenast .
" automatic data retention has to go because it 's a temptation for thieves . "
the free democrats ' spokeswoman for internal affairs gisela pilz accused the grand coalition partners of paving the way for the telekom scandal .
the data retention law , which came into force at the beginning of this year , was passed under the conservative-social democratic government .
public mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians could only agree that they condemned the spying affair in 2005 , and likely in 2006 , telekom hired an outside firm check for calls made by company employees to journalists as part of an effort to discover the source of leaks to the press .

"
senator barack obama has clinched the democratic nomination .
dw-world.de spoke to former us ambassador to germany john kornblum about the prospect of an obama presidency . john kornblum served as us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 during the clinton administration .
he also served as one of hillary clinton 's advisors during the campaign that ended late tuesday , june 3 , with senator barack obama securing the democratic nomination .
kornblum , 65 , who has been a career diplomat since 1964 with several stints in germany , is now a senior advisor at the private investment banking firm lazard germany and is a long-time resident of berlin . dw-world.de : barack obama is now the democratic nominee , but can he win the general elections in november ?
john kornblum : the question needs to be put the other way around .
given the sad state of the republican party , is there a chance that john mccain can win ?
the republicans nominated the best candidate possible .
mccain is a moderate within his party , a well-known us senator and a war hero .
one disadvantage is his age - 72 when he would assume office - although the definition of what is too old to become president is changing these days .
the republicans have nominated someone who has a fighting chance , but all things being equal , i 'm betting on the democrats winning . is america ready for a black chief executive in the white house ?
i do n't know , but it 's the first time that a black candidate has a real shot at the presidency .
the race is wide open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kornblum was us ambassador to germany from 1997-2001 if europeans could vote for us president , obama would win by a landslide , according to various polls .
why is obama so appealing to germans and other europeans ?
for the same reason he is appealing to americans .
after a difficult period in the world -lsb- with the bush administration leading the us -rsb- obama is a fresh new face , someone who offers a vision , a fresh start and brings people together , instead of dividing them .
but europeans also like us presidents to be experienced in world affairs , which obama is not … and he is only 46 years old , a junior senator from illinois .
americans say the same thing .
that is one criticism that has been leveled at obama .
experience does n't matter too much .
few us presidents are very experienced -lsb- in foreign affairs -rsb- .
being us president is a job that involves no training .
you have to learn as you do it .
obama would be 47 when he assumes office , which is older than john f. kennedy or bill clinton were when they took the oath of office .
age does n't make a difference .
obama has got lots of political and practical experience going back 25 years .
you wrote a commentary in britain 's guardian newspaper in which you suggested that europeans and the rest of the world should let the americans know who they want for us president .
can world public opinion and the global media really influence the us elections ?
bildunterschrift : it 's time for the democrats to capture the white house , says kornblum they have already influenced the elections very strongly , by voicing concern over the way the -lsb- bush administration -rsb- has conducted itself in the past eight years .
you look at all the polls .
america 's standing in the world had never ever been so low .
these figures have registered everywhere in the united states .
i hear this again and again from americans - " our standing in the world is so low " - and that in turn has influenced american public opinion of the bush administration 's policies .
so americans do care what the world thinks .
america 's image in the world has now improved , because the campaign has been so exciting and such unique candidates are running .
a name like barack obama goes a long way in how third world countries view the us .
what would a president obama mean to the rest of the world - son of a kenyan father , white american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia , a predominantly muslim country ?
what does this say about america ?
it demonstrates how open and democratic american society is .
all kinds of people make up the american political establishment .
the disadvantage for obama is that americans and the world have such high expectations of him .
once in office , he will find out about the constraints of the presidency - that the political system is complex and hard to move , that he can not hold up to many campaign promises .
this goes for mccain too .
as president , a period of reality sets in and some people could be disappointed .
which candidate - obama or mccain - would be better for europe and the world in terms of foreign policy , free trade ?
both are excellent , and they are really on the same wavelength on the issues .
mccain would be better for trade , since the democrats have ties to trade unions , so they need to be more skeptical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh face : obama with his maternal grandparents if you line up the positions of the two candidates , there are only nuances in the differences .
even on iran -lsb- acquiring a nuclear arsenal -rsb- and the iraq war , obama and mccain are moving closer to each other 's positions .
obama has revised what he said about preconditions in negotiating with iran and mccain has never said he would bomb iraq .
there are no real major differences in substance .
there 's a difference in emphasis - mccain is much more critical of russia , for instance .
you 're saying their campaign rhetoric is going to be different from what either does as president in office .
that 's usually the case , but even what both candidates are saying on the campaign trail is not so different .
once in office , there is a strong push of realism that hits every president .
how would a new american president change us-german or the transatlantic relationship ?
bilateral relations depend not so much on who is president or chancellor , with the exception of 2003 when things got so bad -lsb- after the us-led invasion of iraq , when bush and then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had a falling out over vocal german opposition to the war -rsb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between the us and germany became more cordial under merkel the real issue is not whether one president or chancellor can do better than the previous one , but that europeans - the germans , french , brits - come together with the us to develop a common western strategy .
we need to talk about ourselves , not in terms of north america and europe , but as the " west " becoming an integrated entity .
the atlantic is not a canal separating us , but a bridge joining us together .
one final question : who are you voting for in november ?
obama .
i tend to vote democratic , but not always .
you also said mccain would be excellent .
we 're in a special period right now in that the republicans need to go in the opposition to clear the air after such a difficult eight years . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : europeans mark democratic endgame with yawns and scorn european papers largely ignored the final hours of the democratic primary .
those papers which did cover the campaigning seemed glad it would soon be over , and offered some -lrb- almost -rrb- final thoughts on the loser .
-lrb- 03.06.2008 -rrb- dw-world : europeans favor obama to mccain voters in five major european countries showed a strong preference for barack obama as their favourite candidate to win the united states presidential elections , according to a poll published on friday .

carer david power , 50 , said he was renting a privately-owned home because he could not afford a mortgage .
" i 'm renting because i ca n't afford to buy , " he said .
" there 's not enough council housing for people like me .
i 've applied .. but the list is long because the people on it are in the same position as me .
" they ca n't afford a mortgage either . "
the village is nine miles south of aberystwyth and mr power said prices were as high as £ 200,000 .
" who can afford that ?
rent can be anything up to £ 650 per month or more .
things are pretty tough at the moment . "
mr power added : " i think the only solution is to build council houses .

colin evans bus driver colin evans , 43 , and his hospital office manager partner bethan williams , 34 , have a mortgage on a property they bought a couple of years ago in llanrhystud .

mr evans said a possible solution to the housing problem would be to form self-build co-operatives , which would encourage people to work together to construct their homes .
aberystwyth estate agent aled ellis said it had been difficult for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder for about five years .

aberystwyth estate agent aled ellis said it had been difficult for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder for about five years .
he explained the situation was getting worse because of the current financial climate .
mr ellis said his company rarely sold a property for less than £ 150,000 in aberystwyth and the surrounding areas .
" it 's been a problem for first time buyers four or five years , but it 's very difficult now for them to get on the property ladder unless they can put down a hefty deposit , " said mr ellis .
" with the cost of living increasing people are finding it hard to even save for a deposit , though . "
he added : " in ceredigion planning rules allow for an element of affordable housing when five dwellings or more are built . "

carer david power , 50 , said he was renting a privately-owned home because he could not afford a mortgage .
" i 'm renting because i ca n't afford to buy , " he said .
" there 's not enough council housing for people like me .
i 've applied .. but the list is long because the people on it are in the same position as me .
" they ca n't afford a mortgage either . "
the village is nine miles south of aberystwyth and mr power said prices were as high as £ 200,000 .
" who can afford that ?
rent can be anything up to £ 650 per month or more .
things are pretty tough at the moment . "
mr power added : " i think the only solution is to build council houses .
people should have a right to buy , but what happens when house prices and other costs become too high ? "
" if professional people ca n't afford mortgages then how can a person on an average wage be expected to ? "
colin evans bus driver colin evans , 43 , and his hospital office manager partner bethan williams , 34 , have a mortgage on a property they bought a couple of years ago in llanrhystud .
" costs are going up and i ca n't see how first time buyers are going to get on the property ladder , " said ms williams .
" we desperately need affordable housing for people and especially for those who were born and bred in this area and want to stay here . "
mr evans said : " even professional people who are earning high wages , like doctors , ca n't afford mortgages .
" i have a property in aberystwyth which i rent to a doctor who is in that position .
if professional people ca n't afford mortgages then how can a person on an average wage be expected to ? "
mr evans said a possible solution to the housing problem would be to form self-build co-operatives , which would encourage people to work together to construct their homes .

the family of a schoolgirl stabbed to death in south london had complained of her being attacked before , police said .
the body of arsema dawit , 15 , was found in a lift at matheson lang house , baylis road , waterloo , on monday .
a post-mortem examination showed that the south london teenager died from multiple stab wounds .
neighbours and friends said arsema was being " harassed " by a man and her family had contacted police about it .
a 21-year-old man has been arrested .
police said an allegation of assault and threats to kill against arsema were reported in april .
they added that she had known the man held for her killing .
the man was arrested nearby on monday and is being questioned by detectives over the killing .
arsema , who had turned 15 on friday , is believed to have returned home to the block of flats where she lived when she was attacked .
' threatened to kill ' paramedics arrived at the scene within four minutes but were unable to revive the teenager , who suffered multiple wounds , a london ambulance service spokesman said .
det ch insp caroline goode said : " at this stage i am trying to establish the true nature of the relationship between arsema and the man in custody .
" we are speaking to her family and friends to help build a picture of events leading up to the murder and to help piece together the relationship between them . "
a metropolitan police statement said an allegation of assault and threats to kill against arsema were made on 16 april in a mcdonald 's restaurant .
they said she " was unaware of the incident and had no knowledge of it " when a safer schools officer spoke to her about it on 12 may .
" despite this we continued to investigate the circumstances of the incident and arsema 's mother was subsequently contacted on the 19 may , " the statement added .
" the investigation was still being progressed when arsema was tragically murdered yesterday . "
neighbour wayne fort , whose partner and eight-year-old daughter found arsema in the lift , said : " there was a chap who seemed to be infatuated with her .
he seemed to have met her at the church .
" i could see from the efforts of the elders of the family they were trying to get rid of the man . "
arsema , an eritrean national , is believed to be the 16th teenager to have died violently in london since the start of the year .
police officers have distributed leaflets on the estate in a bid to reassure people and telling them the killing is not gang-related or a stranger murder .

the date marks the 19th anniversary of the brutal crackdown on student and other demonstrators in tiananmen square in beijing in 1989 .
hong kong is the only place under chinese sovereignty where protests are freely allowed on this important date .
this year , concern will also be expressed for the victims of the sichuan earthquake .
quake donations thousands of hong kong residents have gathered every year since 4 june 1989 , lighting candles and calling for democracy and human rights in china .
it is an act of remembrance to honour the students and other demonstrators who were killed when soldiers and tanks moved into tiananmen square .
democrats in hong kong have continued to press for a proper accounting of how many died .
this year they will also raise money for victims of the devastating earthquake in sichuan .
the event is organised by the hong kong alliance in support of the patriotic democratic movement in china .
its spokesman , cheung man-kwong , said both the victims of tiananmen and sichuan would be remembered .
" of course we are concerned about the sichuan earthquake , so that 's why we agree and decide to donate all the money from the 4 june rally in victoria park , " he said .
" i think we will show our concerns about our people in sichuan , about the earthquake of china . "
the suffering of chinese people in the sichuan earthquake offers an opportunity for democracy activists to say that while they might not support the chinese government , they do support the chinese people .

binyam mohamed was charged despite a request from the british government to release him .
if convicted of conspiring to commit terrorism , the 29-year-old from west london could face the death penalty .
lawyers representing mr mohamed say the evidence against him was obtained through torture .
the charges must be approved by the pentagon official who oversees the tribunal system before he faces court .
' repeatedly tortured ' the us charge sheet alleges he travelled to afghanistan in may 2001 and trained at an al-qaeda camp .
it says he then accepted instructions from al-qaeda leader khalid sheikh mohammed to conduct terror operations in the us .
mr mohamed 's lawyers have said he was repeatedly tortured in morocco and are trying to force the british government to release documents to prove this .
foreign secretary david miliband formally wrote to his us counterpart condoleezza rice in august 2007 , asking for mr mohamed 's release .
mr mohamed first came to britain as an asylum seeker in 1994 , aged 16 .
his asylum claim was never finally determined , but he was given leave to remain and went on to work as a cleaner in west london .
his lawyers say he travelled to afghanistan and pakistan in 2001 in a bid to resolve personal issues after developing a drug problem .

" i 've been breaking my heart over it , " said mrs blatchford .
mrs thoms said : " the damp must have got in and the wall is coming down and the insurance people said we have to close . "
the two women have raised money to support the church in a variety of ways over the years but £ 10,000 is now needed to repair the building , which can hold about 100 people .
" we 've been told by our insurers they ca n't give us public liability insurance any more , " said the reverend linda smith , who is the vicar at st john 's .
i find it very sad i ca n't end my days worshipping here ruth blatchford she said that changes in population have played a part in a dwindling congregation .
" we have some specific issues in polperro , " she said .
" it used to be full of people who lived there and who came to church regularly as a way of life but that way of life has disappeared along with quite a few people .
" as we know polperro is largely a holiday destination . "
she said the church council was now interested in the views of people in the village of how the building , which is at the top of a steep path , should be used in the future .
mrs thoms and mrs baltchford will now have to worship at talland parish church , which is just outside the village .
mrs blatchford who was in the church 's choir as a teenager said : " i find it very sad i ca n't end my days worshipping here . "

ireland is the only eu member state to have a public vote on the treaty and both sides have stepped up their campaigning , with many voters still undecided .
here , irish voters reveal how they will cast their ballots and what the main issues are for them .
sandra fitzpatrick , 62 , dublin i am voting no in the referendum .
not one person i have heard , or read , has given me a clearer view of what the central issues of this referendum are and what we are supposed to be voting for .
i feel under those circumstances , it would be extremely foolish to vote yes .
we would be stuck with something we could never change , and to judge by the wording , anything at all could be implemented into the treaty after we have voted for it .
conor newman , 29 , midleton , county cork i will vote yes .
the naysayers have constantly been predicting negative implications from all of the eu treaties , and have been consistently proven to be wrong .
ireland 's economic wealth and success in recent years has been down to our membership of the eu .
if maintaining our country 's economy and global strength is not reason enough to vote yes , then here 's another : jean-marie le pen wants us to vote no - if that does not ring alarm bells , there 's something wrong with you .
the big shout from the no campaign is that we will lose our commissioner .
i do n't know if it is a deliberate oversight , or if they are just ignorant of the role of our commissioner , but losing him is irrelevant , as currently he can not show any preference to ireland anyway .
he is appointed by us , but does not work for us , he works for europe .
terry o 'floinn , 33 , dublin i will be voting yes .
the eu has been good to ireland and we certainly would not have enjoyed the past decade of development without assistance from eu states and access to large trading partners such as britain .
the eu is far from perfect and needs much reform .
the lisbon treaty is another small step in reforming eu institutions and streamlining decision-making processes .
i do have concerns as a citizen of a small country that , for example , we will lose some of the benefits , such as a permanent commissioner .
but on the upside , the introduction of the citizen 's initiative gives citizens of eu countries a bit of a voice to introduce topics for debate in the eu parliament - not perfect but a step in the right direction .
tony rodgers , 18 , cork i will be voting no .
i personally do n't support a constitution for the eu at all .
i only supported the eu as an economic union , and despise the idea of it becoming involved in our social policy .
that aside , even if i did support the eu having a constitution , it would n't include ireland not having a commissioner for five out of every 15 years , as proposed .
i do not like this emerging integrated federal state .
peter buchanan , 48 , wicklow i will be voting yes , only because i believe , having lived in poland , that the eu has a chance to unite europe .
i do feel , however , that it is wrong that ireland is the only country in europe that has an opportunity to vote .
the will of all the people is not being heard and that does not bode well for the future .
elaine norton , 26 , kildare the lisbon treaty remains a complete mystery as far as most irish voters are concerned .
i was recently asked by a work colleague what a yes vote would entail .
i was unable to give an answer .
there have been and will be many more publicised heated debates amongst our politicians on whether to vote yes or no , but no one has outlined what exactly the lisbon treaty is or what it would change .
as a result i intend to vote no until the government decides to explain in full detail what it is we are expected to say yes to .
if in doubt vote no .
there is too much uncertainty as to what a yes vote will bring .
fintan hastings , 24 , galway i will be voting yes for the treaty .
having actually read the text of the document myself i have found that many of the points raised by opponents of lisbon are either untrue or a distortion of the facts .
it is for this reason i feel that irish voters must read the treaty and make an informed decision for themselves .
there has been an unfortunate tendency throughout the referendum campaign for the no side to prey on issues which they know will elicit strong feelings among the irish electorate , such as taxation , the loss of sovereignty and in particular the compromising of our traditional military neutrality .
they have thus far , however , failed to provide any substantive evidence of how the lisbon treaty would in any way affect any of these matters .
john jefferies , 46 , cobh , county cork the eu calls itself a democratic institution but the fact that only one of the 27 member states is holding a referendum on a major institutional change such as the lisbon treaty proves it is not .
the only reason ireland is having a referendum is because a citizen , raymond crotty , took a constitutional challenge in our courts 22 years ago which said that any change to the constitution required a referendum .
the eu must stop telling the people what to do and start listening , and stop handing down major institutional changes which affect the sovereignty of individual member states , and expecting us to merely rubber stamp them .
i will be voting no to the lisbon treaty and i believe we have a good chance of defeating it and forcing all governments of the eu back to the negotiating table .
let 's hope next time they listen to the people of europe .
brian golden , 33 , dublin i 'll be voting yes because this is a hard-fought compromise treaty and it is the best on offer .
there 's significant support for a no vote here , and it 's spread across different groups .
few yet understand the treaty and there 's a danger now that no will become the default option for irish voters .
with the nice treaty referenda , many stayed at home the first time around but came out the second time .
the difference then was the turnout of the yes voters , who were a lot less motivated than the no voters .
so turnout will be crucial this time .
what i do n't like at all is that many , not all , no posters do n't have any name on them .
it could well be foreign groups or some irish fringe groups trying to scaremonger .
declan brennan , 21 , freelance video editor , dublin i am not anti-europe , but i will vote no to the lisbon treaty .
the eu has been good for ireland , but this does not mean we should vote yes out of obligation or some sort of feeling of gratitude .
a yes vote will lead to the eu having the same legal standing as a state and we in ireland will be under its umbrella .
it will also require ireland to invest in its defence forces and contribute irish taxpayers ' money to a fund to get an eu army or rapid reaction force or whatever they 're calling it these days up and running .
i will be voting no because it is a great deal for europe , but an awful deal for ireland .
a no vote will send the eu back to the drawing board to work on a deal that will suit all member states .

but on the upside , the introduction of the citizen 's initiative gives citizens of eu countries a bit of a voice to introduce topics for debate in the eu parliament - not perfect but a step in the right direction .
tony rodgers , 18 , cork i will be voting no .
i personally do n't support a constitution for the eu at all .
i only supported the eu as an economic union , and despise the idea of it becoming involved in our social policy .
that aside , even if i did support the eu having a constitution , it would n't include ireland not having a commissioner for five out of every 15 years , as proposed .
i do not like this emerging integrated federal state .
peter buchanan , 48 , wicklow i will be voting yes , only because i believe , having lived in poland , that the eu has a chance to unite europe .
i do feel , however , that it is wrong that ireland is the only country in europe that has an opportunity to vote .
the will of all the people is not being heard and that does not bode well for the future .
elaine norton , 26 , kildare the lisbon treaty remains a complete mystery as far as most irish voters are concerned .
i was recently asked by a work colleague what a yes vote would entail .
i was unable to give an answer .
there have been and will be many more publicised heated debates amongst our politicians on whether to vote yes or no , but no one has outlined what exactly the lisbon treaty is or what it would change .
as a result i intend to vote no until the government decides to explain in full detail what it is we are expected to say yes to .
if in doubt vote no .
there is too much uncertainty as to what a yes vote will bring .
fintan hastings , 24 , galway i will be voting yes for the treaty .
having actually read the text of the document myself i have found that many of the points raised by opponents of lisbon are either untrue or a distortion of the facts .
it is for this reason i feel that irish voters must read the treaty and make an informed decision for themselves .
there has been an unfortunate tendency throughout the referendum campaign for the no side to prey on issues which they know will elicit strong feelings among the irish electorate , such as taxation , the loss of sovereignty and in particular the compromising of our traditional military neutrality .
they have thus far , however , failed to provide any substantive evidence of how the lisbon treaty would in any way affect any of these matters .
john jefferies , 46 , cobh , county cork the eu calls itself a democratic institution but the fact that only one of the 27 member states is holding a referendum on a major institutional change such as the lisbon treaty proves it is not .
the only reason ireland is having a referendum is because a citizen , raymond crotty , took a constitutional challenge in our courts 22 years ago which said that any change to the constitution required a referendum .
the eu must stop telling the people what to do and start listening , and stop handing down major institutional changes which affect the sovereignty of individual member states , and expecting us to merely rubber stamp them .
i will be voting no to the lisbon treaty and i believe we have a good chance of defeating it and forcing all governments of the eu back to the negotiating table .
let 's hope next time they listen to the people of europe .
brian golden , 33 , dublin i 'll be voting yes because this is a hard-fought compromise treaty and it is the best on offer .
there 's significant support for a no vote here , and it 's spread across different groups .
few yet understand the treaty and there 's a danger now that no will become the default option for irish voters .
with the nice treaty referenda , many stayed at home the first time around but came out the second time .
the difference then was the turnout of the yes voters , who were a lot less motivated than the no voters .
so turnout will be crucial this time .
what i do n't like at all is that many , not all , no posters do n't have any name on them .
it could well be foreign groups or some irish fringe groups trying to scaremonger .
declan brennan , 21 , freelance video editor , dublin i am not anti-europe , but i will vote no to the lisbon treaty .
the eu has been good for ireland , but this does not mean we should vote yes out of obligation or some sort of feeling of gratitude .
a yes vote will lead to the eu having the same legal standing as a state and we in ireland will be under its umbrella .
it will also require ireland to invest in its defence forces and contribute irish taxpayers ' money to a fund to get an eu army or rapid reaction force or whatever they 're calling it these days up and running .
i will be voting no because it is a great deal for europe , but an awful deal for ireland .
a no vote will send the eu back to the drawing board to work on a deal that will suit all member states .

ireland is the only eu member state to have a public vote on the treaty and both sides have stepped up their campaigning , with many voters still undecided .
here , irish voters reveal how they will cast their ballots and what the main issues are for them .
sandra fitzpatrick , 62 , dublin i am voting no in the referendum .
not one person i have heard , or read , has given me a clearer view of what the central issues of this referendum are and what we are supposed to be voting for .
i feel under those circumstances , it would be extremely foolish to vote yes .
we would be stuck with something we could never change , and to judge by the wording , anything at all could be implemented into the treaty after we have voted for it .
conor newman , 29 , midleton , county cork i will vote yes .
the naysayers have constantly been predicting negative implications from all of the eu treaties , and have been consistently proven to be wrong .
ireland 's economic wealth and success in recent years has been down to our membership of the eu .
if maintaining our country 's economy and global strength is not reason enough to vote yes , then here 's another : jean-marie le pen wants us to vote no - if that does not ring alarm bells , there 's something wrong with you .
the big shout from the no campaign is that we will lose our commissioner .
i do n't know if it is a deliberate oversight , or if they are just ignorant of the role of our commissioner , but losing him is irrelevant , as currently he can not show any preference to ireland anyway .
he is appointed by us , but does not work for us , he works for europe .
terry o 'floinn , 33 , dublin i will be voting yes .
the eu has been good to ireland and we certainly would not have enjoyed the past decade of development without assistance from eu states and access to large trading partners such as britain .
the eu is far from perfect and needs much reform .
the lisbon treaty is another small step in reforming eu institutions and streamlining decision-making processes .

john jefferies , 46 , cobh , county cork the eu calls itself a democratic institution but the fact that only one of the 27 member states is holding a referendum on a major institutional change such as the lisbon treaty proves it is not .
the only reason ireland is having a referendum is because a citizen , raymond crotty , took a constitutional challenge in our courts 22 years ago which said that any change to the constitution required a referendum .
the eu must stop telling the people what to do and start listening , and stop handing down major institutional changes which affect the sovereignty of individual member states , and expecting us to merely rubber stamp them .
i will be voting no to the lisbon treaty and i believe we have a good chance of defeating it and forcing all governments of the eu back to the negotiating table .
let 's hope next time they listen to the people of europe .
brian golden , 33 , dublin i 'll be voting yes because this is a hard-fought compromise treaty and it is the best on offer .
there 's significant support for a no vote here , and it 's spread across different groups .
few yet understand the treaty and there 's a danger now that no will become the default option for irish voters .
with the nice treaty referenda , many stayed at home the first time around but came out the second time .
the difference then was the turnout of the yes voters , who were a lot less motivated than the no voters .
so turnout will be crucial this time .
what i do n't like at all is that many , not all , no posters do n't have any name on them .
it could well be foreign groups or some irish fringe groups trying to scaremonger .
declan brennan , 21 , freelance video editor , dublin i am not anti-europe , but i will vote no to the lisbon treaty .
the eu has been good for ireland , but this does not mean we should vote yes out of obligation or some sort of feeling of gratitude .
a yes vote will lead to the eu having the same legal standing as a state and we in ireland will be under its umbrella .
it will also require ireland to invest in its defence forces and contribute irish taxpayers ' money to a fund to get an eu army or rapid reaction force or whatever they 're calling it these days up and running .
i will be voting no because it is a great deal for europe , but an awful deal for ireland .
a no vote will send the eu back to the drawing board to work on a deal that will suit all member states .

ireland is the only eu member state to have a public vote on the treaty and both sides have stepped up their campaigning , with many voters still undecided .
here , irish voters reveal how they will cast their ballots and what the main issues are for them .
sandra fitzpatrick , 62 , dublin i am voting no in the referendum .
not one person i have heard , or read , has given me a clearer view of what the central issues of this referendum are and what we are supposed to be voting for .
i feel under those circumstances , it would be extremely foolish to vote yes .
we would be stuck with something we could never change , and to judge by the wording , anything at all could be implemented into the treaty after we have voted for it .
conor newman , 29 , midleton , county cork i will vote yes .
the naysayers have constantly been predicting negative implications from all of the eu treaties , and have been consistently proven to be wrong .
ireland 's economic wealth and success in recent years has been down to our membership of the eu .
if maintaining our country 's economy and global strength is not reason enough to vote yes , then here 's another : jean-marie le pen wants us to vote no - if that does not ring alarm bells , there 's something wrong with you .
the big shout from the no campaign is that we will lose our commissioner .
i do n't know if it is a deliberate oversight , or if they are just ignorant of the role of our commissioner , but losing him is irrelevant , as currently he can not show any preference to ireland anyway .
he is appointed by us , but does not work for us , he works for europe .
terry o 'floinn , 33 , dublin i will be voting yes .
the eu has been good to ireland and we certainly would not have enjoyed the past decade of development without assistance from eu states and access to large trading partners such as britain .
the eu is far from perfect and needs much reform .
the lisbon treaty is another small step in reforming eu institutions and streamlining decision-making processes .
i do have concerns as a citizen of a small country that , for example , we will lose some of the benefits , such as a permanent commissioner .
but on the upside , the introduction of the citizen 's initiative gives citizens of eu countries a bit of a voice to introduce topics for debate in the eu parliament - not perfect but a step in the right direction .
tony rodgers , 18 , cork i will be voting no .
i personally do n't support a constitution for the eu at all .
i only supported the eu as an economic union , and despise the idea of it becoming involved in our social policy .
that aside , even if i did support the eu having a constitution , it would n't include ireland not having a commissioner for five out of every 15 years , as proposed .
i do not like this emerging integrated federal state .
peter buchanan , 48 , wicklow i will be voting yes , only because i believe , having lived in poland , that the eu has a chance to unite europe .
i do feel , however , that it is wrong that ireland is the only country in europe that has an opportunity to vote .
the will of all the people is not being heard and that does not bode well for the future .
elaine norton , 26 , kildare the lisbon treaty remains a complete mystery as far as most irish voters are concerned .
i was recently asked by a work colleague what a yes vote would entail .
i was unable to give an answer .
there have been and will be many more publicised heated debates amongst our politicians on whether to vote yes or no , but no one has outlined what exactly the lisbon treaty is or what it would change .
as a result i intend to vote no until the government decides to explain in full detail what it is we are expected to say yes to .
if in doubt vote no .
there is too much uncertainty as to what a yes vote will bring .
fintan hastings , 24 , galway i will be voting yes for the treaty .
having actually read the text of the document myself i have found that many of the points raised by opponents of lisbon are either untrue or a distortion of the facts .
it is for this reason i feel that irish voters must read the treaty and make an informed decision for themselves .
there has been an unfortunate tendency throughout the referendum campaign for the no side to prey on issues which they know will elicit strong feelings among the irish electorate , such as taxation , the loss of sovereignty and in particular the compromising of our traditional military neutrality .
they have thus far , however , failed to provide any substantive evidence of how the lisbon treaty would in any way affect any of these matters .

speaking to the main pro-israel lobby in the us , he said iran must be shown there will be devastating consequences if it did develop such weapons .
the us and others have accused iran of building a nuclear arms capability .
tehran says its programme is peaceful .
mr olmert 's us visit comes as he faces pressure at home over corruption allegations , which he denies .
mr olmert is expected to discuss the iranian nuclear issue in talks with president george w bush on wednesday .
un concern mr olmert told members of the american israel public affairs committee that targeted economic sanctions imposed against iran were not enough .
" the long-term cost of a nuclear iran greatly outweighs the short-term benefits of doing business with iran , " he said .
he continued that iran 's flouting of the international measures so far " leave no doubt as to the urgent need for more drastic and robust measures " .
" the international community has a duty and responsibility to clarify to iran , through drastic measures , that the repercussions of their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons will be devastating , " he said .
ayatollah ali khamenei has denied iran is seeking nuclear weapons he did not specify what these measures might be .
he also said peace with the palestinians was " attainable " , and pledged to pursue a " historic breakthrough " for peace by the end of the year .
correspondents say it was the israeli prime minister 's strongest warning yet to iran .
it followed a speech by iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , in which he insisted his country would not make nuclear weapons but would continue its civilian nuclear programme .
earlier , the un 's nuclear watchdog said iran 's alleged research into warheads was of " serious concern " , urging the country to give " full disclosure " on its atomic work .
at home mr olmert has faced calls that he step down over allegations of corruption .
the prime minister has been accused of taking $ 500,000 -lrb- £ 250,000 -rrb- in bribes or illegal campaign donations , accusations that he denies .
he has not been charged , but says he would resign if indicted .

experts believe between 25 and 30 billion barrels could still be recovered over the next 40 years .
calculating oil reserves is not an exact science and this fact has made it difficult over the years to weigh up the true wealth of oil beneath the north sea .
oil producers have tended to play down their oil reserves .
the markets do not cope well with shocks , so companies take the view that it is better to pleasantly surprise than disappoint them .
in 2004 , shell stunned shareholders when it revised its proven oil and gas reserves , slimming the figure by 20 % .
the revelation had an instant impact on the company 's share price and has served as a lesson to the industry ever since .
the first minister and former oil economist alex salmond told me that there was another motivation for oil companies ' reticence .
he said : " if oil companies said ' look we 've got lots of reserves in the future ' , the immediate response of government would be to stick taxation up .
so there was a kind of incentive for the big companies to underplay the significance of the province . "
that is hardly surprising - since the late 1960s , the oil companies have paid £ 140bn in taxation to the treasury .
we 're bringing on four new fields this year .
we 're talking hundreds of millions of pounds john gallagher shell that is a pretty big disincentive .
no wonder there is such divergence over how much oil is left in the north sea .
sir bernard ingham , who was press secretary in the department of energy when north sea oil came ashore , admitted that government negotiations with the oil companies always boiled down to the same thing - taxation .
as he put it : " the whole political calculation is how much brass can you get out of north sea oil without driving the oil companies away . "
the one thing that i did not expect to find in my investigation was that the proven reserves on some of the region 's oldest fields are in fact rising .
the forties field , one of the biggest and most iconic , is still producing oil 33 years after the first oil was pumped ashore .
higher costs five years ago , bp sold it to the texas-based oil exploration and production company apache .
since then apache has invested $ 2bn in the field 's sub sea network , its platforms and in re-evaluating how much oil is in the field .
according to jim house , ceo of apache , flow rates from the forties field have increased and the amount of recoverable oil has also increased .
he said : " forties was definitely showing her age when apache took it .
at the time when it was sold , pre-developed reserved were in the region of 150 million barrels .
we ended last year with 200 million barrels on our books . "

advertisement preview of the bbc scotland investigation the downside to operating off the coast of scotland has always been the relatively higher cost and , as the region matures , that cost factor is becoming more fundamental for the oil majors .
shell has also been selling off some of its core assets in the north sea to newer and more aggressive companies like fairfield energy .
through shooting new seismic surveys and drilling new wells these new players are extending the life of north sea oil fields .
john gallagher , from shell in aberdeen , said his company was still committed to the area .
he said : " we 're bringing on four new fields this year .
we 're talking hundreds of millions of pounds .
" the plant rejuvenation work that we 're doing is hundreds of millions of pounds and the work we 're doing cross-border - linking up norway and the uk , which is a growing trend in our industry - is again hundreds of millions of pounds . "
huge gamble the same high oil price that makes it harder for you and me to drive to the shops on a whim is making it easier for companies to take a gamble on previously undeveloped parts of the north sea .
with a simple oil well costing $ 22m to drill , exploration companies are taking a huge gamble .
canadian oil exploration company oilexco last year drilled 39 out of 140 exploration and appraisal wells in the north sea , despite rising costs .
its chief executive officer , arthur millholland , said " in 2004 we were paying approximately $ 55,000 a day for a drilling rig .
" today we 're paying $ 350,000 a day .
so even though the price of oil today is higher than it was in 2004 , our costs of doing business here have increased just as dramatically . "
it still seems to be worth their while staying in the north sea , despite the high costs .
what i have seen in my investigation is an industry that is better placed to shoulder these costs .
smaller companies with lower overheads can go after smaller pockets of oil and still make a decent profit .
how long will north sea oil last ?
the answer to that depends on many things , including market conditions , future government initiatives and constant technological improvements .
technology alone is playing its part in extending the activity in the north sea .
john forrest , talisman energy 's general manager for the flotta catchment area , said the company was now drilling wells that they were unable to drill five to 10 years ago .
world-class he said : " we 're bringing on fields that we 've known were there for quite a long time but they just were n't economic or we did n't have the technologies .
we recently brought on a field without drilling any more wells .
we just had better technology . "
the talisman-owned claymore platform is expected to keep pumping oil for another 30 years .
mr forrest said : " we foresee an economic life at that installation until the late 2030s and that 's with the ideas we currently have .
we think other innovations will come along that will almost certainly extend that . "
the north sea has many things in its favour .
it has world-class geology which makes it attractive to those wanting to harvest its rich reservoirs .
compared with many of the world 's oil producing regions , it is governed by a relatively stable political and economic regime .
the market price of oil is a much more volatile factor , but at current prices the oil that still lies beneath the north sea is becoming more and more valuable every day .
bbc scotland 's journalists are focusing on the high price of oil , and what this means for the industry in the north sea , this week .
hayley miller will present a special hour-long documentary - truth , lies , scotland and oil - at 2240 bst on wednesday on bbc one scotland .

we 're talking hundreds of millions of pounds john gallagher shell that is a pretty big disincentive .
no wonder there is such divergence over how much oil is left in the north sea .
sir bernard ingham , who was press secretary in the department of energy when north sea oil came ashore , admitted that government negotiations with the oil companies always boiled down to the same thing - taxation .
as he put it : " the whole political calculation is how much brass can you get out of north sea oil without driving the oil companies away . "
the one thing that i did not expect to find in my investigation was that the proven reserves on some of the region 's oldest fields are in fact rising .
the forties field , one of the biggest and most iconic , is still producing oil 33 years after the first oil was pumped ashore .
higher costs five years ago , bp sold it to the texas-based oil exploration and production company apache .
since then apache has invested $ 2bn in the field 's sub sea network , its platforms and in re-evaluating how much oil is in the field .
according to jim house , ceo of apache , flow rates from the forties field have increased and the amount of recoverable oil has also increased .
he said : " forties was definitely showing her age when apache took it .
at the time when it was sold , pre-developed reserved were in the region of 150 million barrels .
we ended last year with 200 million barrels on our books . "

advertisement preview of the bbc scotland investigation the downside to operating off the coast of scotland has always been the relatively higher cost and , as the region matures , that cost factor is becoming more fundamental for the oil majors .
shell has also been selling off some of its core assets in the north sea to newer and more aggressive companies like fairfield energy .
through shooting new seismic surveys and drilling new wells these new players are extending the life of north sea oil fields .
john gallagher , from shell in aberdeen , said his company was still committed to the area .
he said : " we 're bringing on four new fields this year .
we 're talking hundreds of millions of pounds .
" the plant rejuvenation work that we 're doing is hundreds of millions of pounds and the work we 're doing cross-border - linking up norway and the uk , which is a growing trend in our industry - is again hundreds of millions of pounds . "
huge gamble the same high oil price that makes it harder for you and me to drive to the shops on a whim is making it easier for companies to take a gamble on previously undeveloped parts of the north sea .
with a simple oil well costing $ 22m to drill , exploration companies are taking a huge gamble .
canadian oil exploration company oilexco last year drilled 39 out of 140 exploration and appraisal wells in the north sea , despite rising costs .
its chief executive officer , arthur millholland , said " in 2004 we were paying approximately $ 55,000 a day for a drilling rig .
" today we 're paying $ 350,000 a day .
so even though the price of oil today is higher than it was in 2004 , our costs of doing business here have increased just as dramatically . "
it still seems to be worth their while staying in the north sea , despite the high costs .
what i have seen in my investigation is an industry that is better placed to shoulder these costs .
smaller companies with lower overheads can go after smaller pockets of oil and still make a decent profit .
how long will north sea oil last ?
the answer to that depends on many things , including market conditions , future government initiatives and constant technological improvements .
technology alone is playing its part in extending the activity in the north sea .
john forrest , talisman energy 's general manager for the flotta catchment area , said the company was now drilling wells that they were unable to drill five to 10 years ago .
world-class he said : " we 're bringing on fields that we 've known were there for quite a long time but they just were n't economic or we did n't have the technologies .
we recently brought on a field without drilling any more wells .
we just had better technology . "
the talisman-owned claymore platform is expected to keep pumping oil for another 30 years .
mr forrest said : " we foresee an economic life at that installation until the late 2030s and that 's with the ideas we currently have .
we think other innovations will come along that will almost certainly extend that . "
the north sea has many things in its favour .
it has world-class geology which makes it attractive to those wanting to harvest its rich reservoirs .
compared with many of the world 's oil producing regions , it is governed by a relatively stable political and economic regime .
the market price of oil is a much more volatile factor , but at current prices the oil that still lies beneath the north sea is becoming more and more valuable every day .
bbc scotland 's journalists are focusing on the high price of oil , and what this means for the industry in the north sea , this week .
hayley miller will present a special hour-long documentary - truth , lies , scotland and oil - at 2240 bst on wednesday on bbc one scotland .
