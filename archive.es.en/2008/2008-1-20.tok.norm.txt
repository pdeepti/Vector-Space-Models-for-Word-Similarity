while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .

whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .

as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .
while stuttgart briefly flirted with the relegation places in the worst start by a title-holding team in bundesliga history , the champions will not roll over for the royal blues and the first game back will prove a test of mettle for both teams . at the other end of the table , bottom club duisburg face a tough local derby against borussia dortmund .
bvb are having a wildly erratic season , even by their own chaotic standards , and are quite capable of thrashing duisburg or being undone by them - as they were on the opening day of the season . nuremberg , the third team in the relegation zone , travel to surprise package karlsruhe hoping for a win to take them out of the bottom three .
if rostock fall to bayern , a win over the over-achieving promoted side will give hans meyer 's team a leg up out of the basement . in one of the closest and most exciting bundesliga seasons in years , there is still much to do and much at stake at both ends of the table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia 's decision has sparked outrage among its employees in germany the head of the ig metall trade union , berthold huber , on friday said steps needed to be taken to keep companies from abandoning germany . " in germany it is much too easy for companies to close factories and leave people unemployed , " he said .
" these companies do enormous damage to society , and they need to be held responsible for it . " politicians call for nokia boycott a few german politicians have said they would trade in their nokia cell phones for another brand . kurt beck , head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coaltion , called for an indirect boycott of nokia cell phones . " it 's not my style to call for a goods boycott , " beck told german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" but for me as i 'm sure for many germans , the name nokia does n't have a good ring to it anymore , " he said , adding that we would not use the company 's cell phone any more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings are running high in germany after nokia 's decision to move production to romania " we can all together make it clear that we 're not going to led ourselves be misled .

" european commission president jose manuel barroso hinted the european union might be prepared to help those affected . " i understand the dismay of the people in bochum , " he told german magazine wirtschaftswoche .
" for the very reason we know how hard the process of change can be , we have social and globalization funds in cases where member states ca n't shoulder the burden of such changes . " nokia on " wrong path " verheugen , a german who also serves as commission vice president under jose manuel barroso , said nokia 's surprise announcement of the closure of the german plant pointed to " serious management failures . " " nokia 's behavior is the product of a new religion which idolizes shareholder value , " he said .
" that 's the wrong path . " nokia , which makes almost 40 per cent of the world 's mobile phones , has insisted its decision was soundly based and that it was final . industry insiders in germany said the factory-gate price of a no-frills phone had fallen to less than 10 euros , although others noted that wages made up just five per cent of the cost of a mobile phone made at the bochum plant . nokia is to hold talks with german politicians and worker representatives on a social package to ease the closure . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .
while stuttgart briefly flirted with the relegation places in the worst start by a title-holding team in bundesliga history , the champions will not roll over for the royal blues and the first game back will prove a test of mettle for both teams . at the other end of the table , bottom club duisburg face a tough local derby against borussia dortmund .

" nokia gives us cause to reconsider state policy on subsidies altogether , " verheugen told the paper .
" i think there 's no sense in the state paying subsidies in order to attract companies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen wants to see action after nokia 's decision nokia , the world 's biggest cell phone maker , said this week it would close a plant in the city of bochum in germany 's western industrial ruhr region because it was not competitive and move production to romania instead .
it plans to relocate to the towns of cluj and jucu in romania on grounds of lower wage costs . the company said the move will cost up to 2,300 layoffs at the bochum plant .
a number of part-time workers at the site have already been dismissed , according to a german newspaper report over the weekend . " a subsidy locust " nokia 's decision has provoked outrage in germany , with state politicians threatening to seek the repayment of some the more than 80 million euros -lrb- $ 120 million -rrb- in state and federal subsidies the company had received over the 20 years of the plant 's existence . north rhine-westphalia economics minister christa thoben asked whether the company was receiving a subsidy from the european union to set up in romania .
germany is the largest contributor to eu funds . and state premier jürgen rüttgers suggested the company was behaving like a " subsidy locust . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia 's decision has sparked outrage among its employees in germany the head of the ig metall trade union , berthold huber , on friday said steps needed to be taken to keep companies from abandoning germany . " in germany it is much too easy for companies to close factories and leave people unemployed , " he said .
" these companies do enormous damage to society , and they need to be held responsible for it . " politicians call for nokia boycott a few german politicians have said they would trade in their nokia cell phones for another brand . kurt beck , head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coaltion , called for an indirect boycott of nokia cell phones . " it 's not my style to call for a goods boycott , " beck told german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" but for me as i 'm sure for many germans , the name nokia does n't have a good ring to it anymore , " he said , adding that we would not use the company 's cell phone any more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings are running high in germany after nokia 's decision to move production to romania " we can all together make it clear that we 're not going to led ourselves be misled .
germany has 82 million consumers . " german finance minister peer steinbrück , who is from the spd , attacked what he called nokia 's " caravan capitalism . " european commission president jose manuel barroso hinted the european union might be prepared to help those affected . " i understand the dismay of the people in bochum , " he told german magazine wirtschaftswoche .
" for the very reason we know how hard the process of change can be , we have social and globalization funds in cases where member states ca n't shoulder the burden of such changes . " nokia on " wrong path " verheugen , a german who also serves as commission vice president under jose manuel barroso , said nokia 's surprise announcement of the closure of the german plant pointed to " serious management failures . " " nokia 's behavior is the product of a new religion which idolizes shareholder value , " he said .
" that 's the wrong path . " nokia , which makes almost 40 per cent of the world 's mobile phones , has insisted its decision was soundly based and that it was final . industry insiders in germany said the factory-gate price of a no-frills phone had fallen to less than 10 euros , although others noted that wages made up just five per cent of the cost of a mobile phone made at the bochum plant . nokia is to hold talks with german politicians and worker representatives on a social package to ease the closure . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .

as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .

in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .

rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .

the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .
while stuttgart briefly flirted with the relegation places in the worst start by a title-holding team in bundesliga history , the champions will not roll over for the royal blues and the first game back will prove a test of mettle for both teams . at the other end of the table , bottom club duisburg face a tough local derby against borussia dortmund .
bvb are having a wildly erratic season , even by their own chaotic standards , and are quite capable of thrashing duisburg or being undone by them - as they were on the opening day of the season . nuremberg , the third team in the relegation zone , travel to surprise package karlsruhe hoping for a win to take them out of the bottom three .
if rostock fall to bayern , a win over the over-achieving promoted side will give hans meyer 's team a leg up out of the basement . in one of the closest and most exciting bundesliga seasons in years , there is still much to do and much at stake at both ends of the table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 20.01.2008 bundesliga season 's second half all about the klinsi factor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clean-cut klinsi took germany to the world cup semi-final in 2006 it says much about jürgen klinsmann that the title race has become about him even though he does n't take over in munich until july .
while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .
while stuttgart briefly flirted with the relegation places in the worst start by a title-holding team in bundesliga history , the champions will not roll over for the royal blues and the first game back will prove a test of mettle for both teams . at the other end of the table , bottom club duisburg face a tough local derby against borussia dortmund .
bvb are having a wildly erratic season , even by their own chaotic standards , and are quite capable of thrashing duisburg or being undone by them - as they were on the opening day of the season . nuremberg , the third team in the relegation zone , travel to surprise package karlsruhe hoping for a win to take them out of the bottom three .
if rostock fall to bayern , a win over the over-achieving promoted side will give hans meyer 's team a leg up out of the basement . in one of the closest and most exciting bundesliga seasons in years , there is still much to do and much at stake at both ends of the table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany . the bundesliga teams should be well warmed up by the time the winter break ends and the championship race begins again in earnest on feb .
2 .
as hostilities resume once more , the main question remains whether bayern munich 's expensively assembled squad can keep ambitious werder bremen at bay to capture their 21st title . however , this question has taken on a new dimension during the seasonal pause .
before the break , bayern had lost some of their sparkle and looked in need of a breather .
while a few weeks off appears to have sharpened their senses and eye for goal once more - the 7-2 demolition of the chinese national team serving as exhibit a - another factor can be attributed to their rediscovered form . the appointment of jürgen klinsmann as the successor to departing coach ottmar hitzfeld in the summer has sent a feel-good factor rippling not only through munich but the country as a whole .
even those who want their own team to win the league afforded themselves a warm smile at the return of the former germany coach .
the man brings a glow with him , wherever he goes .
as a dw colleague quite rightly lamented after the appointment was announced , " klinsi is going to make it so hard to hate bayern . " klinsi 's charisma gives bayern a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all smiles on friday , jan .
11 , when klinsmann said he would be bayern 's coach as of july klinsmann 's appointment , while not having any hands-on effect in regard to the team itself before the 2008/09 season , has surely given the worn-out stars of bayern a boost .
in that respect , it has been a masterstroke of motivational management to reveal him now .
after leading germany to third place at the 2006 world cup , klinsmann breeds optimism . the nagging doubts as to whether he can turn that enthusiasm and hope into trophies is something to worry about for another day .
right now , knowing klinsi is coming could be the edge bayern need to recapture their early scintillating form .
whether the " klinsi bounce " will be enough to sustain the bavarian giants through to a championship-winning party in may , however , remains to be seen . in contrast , his appointment must have been cursed by all those other coaches attempting to get their hands on the championship shield , albeit curses muttered from behind a resigned grin . not one to break into rapturous laughter at the best of times , bremen 's thomas schaaf must have been particularly peeved .
werder , like the rest of the league , were well adrift of munich in the early stages of the season , chasing a gap of between four and six points for most of september and october . but then bremen hit their top form , courtesy mainly of their inspired playmaker diego .
towards the end of november , both bremen and hamburg had slashed the lead to a point .
as hamburg faltered in december , bremen stepped on the gas , dropping just three points of a possible 18 , pulling away to end the first half of the season joint top with bayern , second only on goal difference . bayern and bremen battle wills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego after he scored against vfb stuttgart in september while the dispirited and lackluster bayern looked longingly at the winter break , bremen lamented the enforced curtailment of their momentum .
had the season gone on unhindered , it would have undoubtedly seen werder build their own lead at the top while munich searched for ideas and cohesion .
unfortunately for everyone - bremen in particular - bayern have had time to regroup and have been give a moral boost in the form of their new and dynamic coach waiting in the wings . first to get the taste of bayern 's second wind will be 15th-placed hansa rostock .
rostock were the unlucky recipients of munich 's first wind , blown away 3-0 in the opening game of the season .
with things now settled behind the scenes at the allianz arena , a bayern team at ease with itself should record its first win of 2008 away to the northern strugglers . second-placed bremen will hope to keep pace by beating vfl bochum on their return to action .
the ruhr valley team hit the skids before the break and now sit in 13th after a brief spell in the top five .
if bremen are still in possession of their pre-winter scoring boots , nothing much could change at the summit except their " goals for " tally . bringing up the rear hamburg will want to make up some ground on the top two by beating seventh-placed hanover but could find themselves slipping further off the pace if they lose and fourth-placed bayer leverkusen beat second-from-bottom club cottbus .
in that event , leverkusen would leapfrog hsv into third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansa rostock and fc schalke 04 battled it out last october schalke 04 , currently in fifth , face reigning but spluttering champions vfb stuttgart in their first game of the new year .
while stuttgart briefly flirted with the relegation places in the worst start by a title-holding team in bundesliga history , the champions will not roll over for the royal blues and the first game back will prove a test of mettle for both teams . at the other end of the table , bottom club duisburg face a tough local derby against borussia dortmund .
bvb are having a wildly erratic season , even by their own chaotic standards , and are quite capable of thrashing duisburg or being undone by them - as they were on the opening day of the season . nuremberg , the third team in the relegation zone , travel to surprise package karlsruhe hoping for a win to take them out of the bottom three .
if rostock fall to bayern , a win over the over-achieving promoted side will give hans meyer 's team a leg up out of the basement . in one of the closest and most exciting bundesliga seasons in years , there is still much to do and much at stake at both ends of the table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

senior first officer john coward told the sunday mirror he believed there was going to be a " catastrophic crash " .
but he said he was only doing his job when he managed to land the stricken boeing 777 safely just inside the airport 's perimeter fence on thursday .
the plane will be moved to a hangar on the eastern side of the airport later .
the wreckage of flight ba038 will be placed on three electronically controlled wheeled platforms so it can be transported 500 metres to ba 's airline 's engineering base , where investigators will continue with their examination .

he said that after the crash " there was no sound at all .

senior first officer john coward told the sunday mirror he believed there was going to be a " catastrophic crash " .
but he said he was only doing his job when he managed to land the stricken boeing 777 safely just inside the airport 's perimeter fence on thursday .
the plane will be moved to a hangar on the eastern side of the airport later .
the wreckage of flight ba038 will be placed on three electronically controlled wheeled platforms so it can be transported 500 metres to ba 's airline 's engineering base , where investigators will continue with their examination .
' shuddered to a halt ' mr coward , 41 , told the sunday mirror how he became aware of a loss of power on board the plane on the final approach to the airport .
" suddenly there was nothing from any of the engines , and the plane started to glide , " he said .
the crew , the passengers , and everybody else acted heroically .
flying is definitely all about teamwork and that is what we all displayed senior first officer john coward " i did n't think we 'd clear the fence at first .
as we landed i was bracing myself for an enormous thud .
but instead of one thud , there was a series of thuds as it bounced along the grass . "
he added : " eventually it shuddered to a halt .
while i was trying to stop the plane .
i struggled to try and keep it in a straight line . "
he said that after the crash " there was no sound at all .
no sound from the engines , no sound from behind .
" i turned around and composed myself and heard a lot of commotion behind me .
i realised that staff were trying to carry out the drills to evacuate all the passengers .
mr coward , who lives in france with his french wife and three children , said he had been left haunted by the incident and has been unable to sleep since thursday .
' professionalism ' mr coward , who was credited by his captain , peter burkill , for averting a major crash , said he was humbled by people calling him a hero , but said : " i was only doing my job . "
the crashed plane is set to be moved to a hangar " the crew , the passengers , and everybody else acted heroically .
flying is definitely all about teamwork and that is what we all displayed , " he added .
earlier captain burkill said mr coward had done a " most remarkable job " in landing the aircraft .
he also praised all the crew for showing " the highest standards of skill and professionalism " .
all 136 passengers and 16 crew on the british airways flight from beijing survived - one person suffered a broken leg and others received minor injuries during the emergency evacuation .
an initial report into the crash-landing by the air accident investigations branch -lrb- aaib -rrb- found the jet 's engines failed to respond to demands for increased thrust from the crew two miles from touchdown .
the aaib is now investigating " the range of aircraft systems that could influence engine operation " , and a more detailed analysis of the flight recorder is also taking place .
the results of the investigations are expected within 30 days .
ba said its specialist recovery team used hydraulic jacks and air bags to position eight canvas strops under the belly of the hull of the aircraft at heathrow so that the three platforms could be positioned .
bruce hunter , general manager operational maintenance , said : " the next stage of this delicate operation will take several hours to complete as the team works meticulously to make sure the aircraft is moved slowly and safely to its new location . "

ieuan wyn jones told bbc wales ' politics show , if a charging scheme for motorists was brought in , it would not be applied to the current road network .
ministers will soon have the power to introduce schemes in wales , under clauses in the new local transport bill .
no decision on how to use the new power has yet to be taken .
mr jones , who is minister for the economy and transport , said : " there 's no prospect whatsoever of introducing charges on the existing network . "

" that 's the only kind of scheme in which it would be practical , " added mr jones .
there has already been speculation that future charging may involve the planned m4 relief road near newport , which could open between magor to castleton by 2013 , if a business case goes forward .
mr jones said local authorities could also be given provision for applying for congestion charging .
three years ago , a document prepared for the cabinet said road chargng had a key role to play in the assembly government 's future transport plans .
road tolls are seen as a potential way of reducing congestion , although environmental groups have urged ministers to move the emphasis from roads to public transport , cycling and walking .
mr jones told a transport conference last week that one of his first aims for transport spending was a " swift north-south rail service that met business needs and cut down on many car journeys . "
the assembly government 's new transport strategy is expected to be published in the spring .

by lissa cook bbc 5 live report free university tuition , free personal care for the elderly , free prescriptions on the way .
has scotland become the land of the free at the expense of britain 's other nations and regions ?
two of these girls will graduate with at least £ 10,000 debt .
one wo n't .
ruth olifant studies anthropology at aberdeen university .
she and her english friend anna have to pay tuition fees capped at £ 3,000 per year , unlike their scottish friend , annie .
ruth says : " it does feel a bit unfair sometimes .
it 's absolutely essential that i work so i can survive , really , because you have this extra burden , this extra debt . "
anna is more resigned : " scotland is a separate country , it has separate powers .
obviously i 'd like to not pay fees - that would be fantastic but you ca n't brew about it . "
barnett formula since devolution , the scottish parliament has had control over its education policies - and rejected up-front tuition fees for scottish students at scottish universities .
they pay a " graduate endowment " at the end of their courses - which , at £ 2,289 for those who began studying in 2006/7 , is by far the cheaper option .
and it 's not only tuition fees .
the elderly in scotland also get free personal care and by 2011 the governing snp want to abolish prescription charges .
what was a political fix over 30 years ago to keep ministers quiet is now being used to transfer huge quantities of money into scotland when they 're needed in the english regions graham stringer what angers mps representing english regions is the system by which money is allocated to the scottish parliament - not by tax revenue but by something called the barnett formula .
the formula allocates a lump sum for scotland , wales and northern ireland , then for every additional pound spent in england - approximately 10p is allocated to scotland , 5p to wales and 3p to northern ireland , based on their populations .
london 's £ 16bn crossrail project will trigger an automatic payment to edinburgh of almost £ 1bn .
" it 's absurd , " said labour 's manchester blackley mp graham stringer .
" what was a political fix over 30 years ago to keep ministers quiet is now being used to transfer huge quantities of money into scotland when they 're needed in the english regions . "
' clearly unfair ' he says money is not distributed according to need : " edinburgh gets its trams .
manchester does n't get its tram extension .
the money flies over manchester into scotland on no rational basis . "
even lord barnett , who was chief secretary to the treasury in 1978 when the formula was introduced , believes the formula should be scrapped .
" it made life a little easier for me and the constant problems i had in cutting public expenditure , to say ' they get a certain amount , leave me alone and you carry on ' .
i never anticipated that it would last very long " .
what scottish oil has delivered over the last 30 years is a very , very helpful resource to prop up the ailing finances of the uk john swinney he blames its survival on successive prime ministers being too afraid of upsetting the scots and the welsh and says expenditure per head is now " clearly unfair " to parts of england .
but the snp 's scottish finance secretary john swinney says , in fact , scotland suffers from a barnett squeeze .
" the barnett formula far from being generous to scotland is actually forcing the difference between public spending in scotland and england together , simply because the scottish population accounts for a much smaller proportion of the uk population that it used to in the past . "
means-tested care a report last year from consultants , oxford economics , suggests that scotland pays roughly as much in tax as it receives in public spending .
mr swinney says scotland is making an enormous contribution through the uk through oil revenues for which they get nothing in return .
" what scottish oil has delivered over the last 30 years is a very , very helpful resource to prop up the ailing finances of the uk .

brian and viv yates have sold their home and are spending their savings on luxuries like holidays and new cars .
they are not reckless spendthrifts .
they have learnt from the experience of viv 's mum who is 96 years old and was recently diagnosed with dementia .
selling home the family have been forced to sell her bungalow because elderly care is means-tested in england .
had they lived in scotland they would still have had to pay for a care home but she would have been entitled to £ 145 for personal care at home and if she needed nursing there would be another £ 65 available to her .
brian said that might have made it possible for her to go back to her own home .
" she had a lovely bungalow , " he said .
viv added : " we paid for someone to come in at lunchtime and my older sister took care in the evening . "

the russians might have lagged behind in military technology or economic competition , but over the chessboard they reigned supreme " was it something we 'd said ?
in fact the pm had to go to the commons for a vote and returned later .
this was the eve of his visit to china .
so what was the trip going to be about ?
" trade , culture , sport , and , er , human rights " , he told us .
even a discussion about human rights with the chinese premier wen jiabao and a narrow escape from a crashing plane may have seemed preferable to the british political scene .
one minister admitted to me that it was impossible to get any serious political messages out while there was so much media focus on peter hain and the problems over his late declared donations .
it does seem that colleagues are losing patience with him .
on monday 's programme ian gibson told our political correspondent , james hardy , that if he had been in the same position , he would resign .
he was voicing what many mps are saying privately .
some backbenchers have appeared to back peter hain , like paul flynn on our programme , but no ministers have come forward and gordon brown 's admission of " an incompetence " and claim that hain had " taken his eye off the ball " rather erodes his claim to have full confidence in him .
northern rock is the northern rock affair eroding brown 's own reputation for competence ?
that was certainly the line of attack from david cameron at prime minister 's questions on wednesday .
but the conservatives ' own position on northern rock is not clear cut .
shadow cabinet member philip hammond came on tuesday 's programme but was not clear about what his party 's plan b would be for northern rock if no private solution was found .
i asked a labour figure close to brown whether they were concerned about the competence problem after northern rock , discgate and so on .
no , he replied , the real issue is the appearance of tiredness , the sense that the government is running out of steam after a decade in power .
police pay there has been an attempt to give a sense of long term strategy through the issue of public sector pay .
the schools secretary ed balls announced this week that he would be accepting the independent pay body 's recommendation on a three year pay deal for teachers which would begin at 2.4 % - above the 2 % government target for public sector pay .
some teachers ' unions welcomed the offer though not the largest - the nut .
on tuesday 's programme we interviewed ed balls and asked whether he had made life more difficult for the home secretary jacqui smith .
she is not implementing the pay review recommendation in full for the police .
news about the teachers made the police union furious .
russian ban just to add fuel to the flames , on wednesday mps were told their own pay offer of 2.6 % .
no wonder gordon brown wants them to vote for less .
lib dem mp matthew taylor said all pay reviews should be implemented no matter whom they concerned .
throughout the week we covered the story in russia as relations worsened with the british council 's decision to reopen despite a russian ban .
on tuesday 's programme the russian ambassador to london , yuri fedotov , told us that this was an act of provocation and there would be retaliation .
cold war that came the following day with the detention of stephen kinnock and questioning of russian staff by the fsb , the secret service .
an mp from putin 's party defended the actions and here labour mp andrew mackinlay criticised the foreign office for mishandling the crisis .
russia anger , he maintained , stemmed from the failure to extradite boris berezovsky many years ago .
we learned from one british council source that the plan is to maintain a presence in the british embassy in moscow - just as they did in 1945 before having to close two years later due to the cold war .
that was where we ended the week , discussing the long years of enmity between russia and the west .
during the cold war that was frequently played out on the chessboard as brian hanrahan discussed with daniel johnson , a commentator on culture and politics who came in after the death of bobby fischer .
johnson has written white king and red queen , a book about chess and the cold war .
his view is that chess provided a mega-metaphor for this psychological war , one that derived added significance from the game 's important role in soviet communist society .
the russians might have lagged behind in military technology or economic competition , but over the chessboard they reigned supreme .
in the current anglo-russian row the red queen seems to be controlling the board .
here is a selection of your comments : the russians seldom lagged behind in military technology- their technological development pattern was different from that of the west , but no less cutting edge .
remember that russia was the first nation to send an artificial satellite successfully into orbit , the first nation to put an astronaut in space , and the first nation to develop an automated pre-targeted icbm launching system -lrb- ' the dead hand ' -rrb- .
it also had the most success with it 's space station -lrb- mir was in service for 20 years , skylab for about 3 ! -rrb-
even now , the west has little to match the mig-29 fighter jet , or the hardiness & reliability of russian small arms .
nobody should ever deride russian military potential , or sneer at it just because the ussr has collapsed- any nation that possesses as many nuclear missiles as russia has , is still a superpower as far as i 'm concerned .
owen morgan , malvern , worcestershire england regarding the northern rock fiasco , if the government -lrb- gordon brown , since he was claiming all the credit for reorganising boe and fsa while devolving boe interest rate decisions , he must take the blame for the structure giving rise to inadequate supervision -rrb- , having messed up banking supervision the issues a guarantee underrighting any bonds issued to refund tranches of our money that the government has lent -lrb- in fact equity -rrb- to northern rock , surely any sale of northern rock must be conducted by a sealed bids public auction using independent trustworthy persons not currently involved in northern rock and certainly not part of this government nor its top civil servants .
the price should include escalating fees payable to the extent the loan is not repaid and equally as any guarantee is offered as to any bond , and additionally a ten year profit share deal .
the apparently cosy relations of some of the players at present is uncomfortable to see .
if the 3g auction of mobile ban ! dwidth was good enough so should it be to sell a bank administration shell with its cash warranted by the government .

" trade , culture , sport , and , er , human rights " , he told us .
even a discussion about human rights with the chinese premier wen jiabao and a narrow escape from a crashing plane may have seemed preferable to the british political scene .
one minister admitted to me that it was impossible to get any serious political messages out while there was so much media focus on peter hain and the problems over his late declared donations .
it does seem that colleagues are losing patience with him .
on monday 's programme ian gibson told our political correspondent , james hardy , that if he had been in the same position , he would resign .
he was voicing what many mps are saying privately .
some backbenchers have appeared to back peter hain , like paul flynn on our programme , but no ministers have come forward and gordon brown 's admission of " an incompetence " and claim that hain had " taken his eye off the ball " rather erodes his claim to have full confidence in him .
northern rock is the northern rock affair eroding brown 's own reputation for competence ?
that was certainly the line of attack from david cameron at prime minister 's questions on wednesday .
but the conservatives ' own position on northern rock is not clear cut .
shadow cabinet member philip hammond came on tuesday 's programme but was not clear about what his party 's plan b would be for northern rock if no private solution was found .
i asked a labour figure close to brown whether they were concerned about the competence problem after northern rock , discgate and so on .
no , he replied , the real issue is the appearance of tiredness , the sense that the government is running out of steam after a decade in power .
police pay there has been an attempt to give a sense of long term strategy through the issue of public sector pay .
jacqui smith is not giving police recommended pay deal the schools secretary ed balls announced this week that he would be accepting the independent pay body 's recommendation on a three year pay deal for teachers which would begin at 2.4 % - above the 2 % government target for public sector pay .
some teachers ' unions welcomed the offer though not the largest - the nut .
on tuesday 's programme we interviewed ed balls and asked whether he had made life more difficult for the home secretary jacqui smith .

the russians might have lagged behind in military technology or economic competition , but over the chessboard they reigned supreme .

the russians might have lagged behind in military technology or economic competition , but over the chessboard they reigned supreme was it something we 'd said ?
in fact the pm had to go to the commons for a vote and returned later .
this was the eve of his visit to china .
so what was the trip going to be about ?
" trade , culture , sport , and , er , human rights " , he told us .
even a discussion about human rights with the chinese premier wen jiabao and a narrow escape from a crashing plane may have seemed preferable to the british political scene .
one minister admitted to me that it was impossible to get any serious political messages out while there was so much media focus on peter hain and the problems over his late declared donations .
it does seem that colleagues are losing patience with him .
on monday 's programme ian gibson told our political correspondent , james hardy , that if he had been in the same position , he would resign .
he was voicing what many mps are saying privately .
some backbenchers have appeared to back peter hain , like paul flynn on our programme , but no ministers have come forward and gordon brown 's admission of " an incompetence " and claim that hain had " taken his eye off the ball " rather erodes his claim to have full confidence in him .
northern rock is the northern rock affair eroding brown 's own reputation for competence ?
that was certainly the line of attack from david cameron at prime minister 's questions on wednesday .
but the conservatives ' own position on northern rock is not clear cut .
shadow cabinet member philip hammond came on tuesday 's programme but was not clear about what his party 's plan b would be for northern rock if no private solution was found .
i asked a labour figure close to brown whether they were concerned about the competence problem after northern rock , discgate and so on .
no , he replied , the real issue is the appearance of tiredness , the sense that the government is running out of steam after a decade in power .
police pay there has been an attempt to give a sense of long term strategy through the issue of public sector pay .
jacqui smith is not giving police recommended pay deal the schools secretary ed balls announced this week that he would be accepting the independent pay body 's recommendation on a three year pay deal for teachers which would begin at 2.4 % - above the 2 % government target for public sector pay .
some teachers ' unions welcomed the offer though not the largest - the nut .
on tuesday 's programme we interviewed ed balls and asked whether he had made life more difficult for the home secretary jacqui smith .
she is not implementing the pay review recommendation in full for the police .
news about the teachers made the police union furious .

the official , john walters , said venezuela had become " a haven " for shipments of cocaine manufactured in neighbouring colombia .
venezuela rejects the charges , saying it is the victim of traffickers .
but mr walters , speaking on a visit to colombia , said failure to deal with the problem amounted to complicity .
mr walters , director of the us office of national drug control policy -lrb- ondcp -rrb- , was meeting colombian president alvaro uribe .
us officials say about one third of colombia 's output of 600 tonnes of cocaine a year now passes through venezuela , most of it going to america and europe .
' colluding ' mr walters said mr chavez had failed to root out corrupt officials or to deny venezuelan ports and airfields to smugglers .
such failure , he said , came from more than neglect .
" it goes beyond ' i ca n't do it ' to ' i wo n't do it ' .
and ' i wo n't do it ' means that ' i am colluding ' , " mr walters said .
" i think it is about time to face up to the fact that president chavez is becoming a major facilitator of the transit of cocaine to europe and other parts of this hemisphere . "
mr walters ' declaration served two purposes , says the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott in colombia .
the first is to support colombia 's president uribe , a key regional ally .
colombia 's relations with venezuela have all but disintegrated amid fears that mr chavez may start actively supporting marxist guerrillas who are trying to overthrow the colombian state .
the second is to berate mr chavez publicly for not co-operating with washington 's region-wide drug strategy .
relations between venezuela and the us are now so poor that us drug enforcement agents can hardly operate in the country , our correspondent says .
