second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .
vfl wolfsburg jumped above stuttgart into sixth on goal difference and level with hamburg after thumping armin veh 's side 4-0 .

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .

until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .

" it was only a small step from isolating the jews to burning their books , and again a small step from the burning of the books to incinerating people , " koehler said . actors , authors and schoolchildren read from the works of some of the 130-odd authors whose works went up in flames , among them bertolt brecht , sigmund freund and thomas mann . some writers forever lost , organizer says but while the names and works of many of the targeted authors are still popular today , others like german writers maria leitner and georg hermann have virtually been forgotten . this shows that in some ways the book burning had a long-term effect , according to olaf zimmermann , managing director of the german council of culture . " yes , it 's disgraceful , but the sad fact is that many authors whose books landed on the bonfires have faded into obscurity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertholt brecht 's work was burned as " degenerate " ...
passages from some of their works will be read out at the weekend events , he said . berlin 's renowned humboldt library and the spanish cultural institute , cervantes , are jointly hosting readings and recitals from the burned works on saturday . " empty library " commemoration the event takes place on the same square where some 40,000 nazi supporters gathered three-quarters-of-a-century ago to witness the book burning in the german capital . today an underground memorial marks the spot on what is now august bebel platz .
conceived as an " empty library , " visitors can view it through a glass window built into the pavement . " it is the right monument in the right place , " according to klaus staeke , president of the academy of arts . records show that at least 35,000 books were burned in 22 cities between may and the end of august 1933 in an event unseen since the middle ages . in berlin , nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels delivered a midnight speech in which he said : " the era of jewish intellectualism is now at an end .
the soul of the german people can express itself again . " blacklists of " degenerates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... as were writings of the father of psychology , sigmund freud the students , who were at the vanguard of the nazi movement , compiled blacklists of undesirable authors and circulated them to public and private libraries . in addition to german-speaking authors , works of american writers jack london , ernest hemingway and helen keller were also consigned to the flames . the book burning was the last major orchestrated event in the early stages of hitler 's rule , following a purge of communists and trade unions and a nazi-organized boycott of jewish goods . guidelines for nazi writers it also marked the start of censorship and the introduction of propaganda ministry " guidelines " to which all writers were expected to adhere . within the space of days the german book trade published a list of 131 authors and ordered libraries and bookshops to cleanse their shelves of their works .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .

" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

anti-europeans hold narrow lead ahead of election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic , left , faces a tough fight to keep his party in power as a result , the serbian radical party leads president boris tadic 's alliance of pro-european parties by a narrow margin in surveys and is expected to form a nationalist government with kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- .
polls show the gap between anti-european and pro-european parties has narrowed since the saa was signed .
but the nationalist bloc led by kostunica and leader of main opposition radical party , tomislav nikolic , could win the most seats in the parliament .
the cabinet session was held even though a campaign blackout entered force overnight , ahead of sunday elections expected to give the ultra-nationalists their best shot at power since slobodan milosevic 's ouster in 2000 .
as it took place , more than 1,000 supporters of the pro-western liberal democratic party staged a noisy demonstration outside the government offices in belgrade to protest the russian deal .
energy deal unanimously agreed by both sides the russian energy deal , signed in january , includes plans for a strategic gas pipeline through serbia and the sale of 51 percent of state-owned oil monopoly nis to russian energy giant gazprom .
if adopted , it could eventually leave much of serbia 's energy sector in russian hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's party and partners voted for the power deal despite leaving the cabinet session over the saa , kostunica 's nationalists later returned to the meeting to vote on the energy deal with russia , which was unanimously accepted by both camps .
both the saa and energy agreement require approval by parliament , where finding a governing majority after sunday 's voting could take weeks .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , representing the presidency of the european union , sent a message to belgrade on friday reiterating the eu 's desire for serbia to become a member and said that the eu was ready to discuss its accession regardless of which bloc wins sunday elections .
eu assures serbia that accession will remain an option " the eu ca n't influence the result of elections , we only want serbia to become a member of the eu as soon as possible , " rupel told a news conference .
" if serbian voters elect nikolic , the radical party , we will talk with those who have been appointed to represent the serbian people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn wants serbians to stay on the path to the eu in a separate statement , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn urged serbians to vote for pro-european candidates saying their victory " would be better for serbia and for europe . "
" serbia faces a critical decision this weekend , " rehn said in an interview with finnish national broadcaster yle .
" support between these two groups , the pro-european democratic group and the more rear-mirror looking nationalistic group , is rather even .
i hope serbia would turn towards europe because it would be better for serbia and for europe . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was only a small step from isolating the jews to burning their books , and again a small step from the burning of the books to incinerating people , " koehler said . actors , authors and schoolchildren read from the works of some of the 130-odd authors whose works went up in flames , among them bertolt brecht , sigmund freund and thomas mann . some writers forever lost , organizer says but while the names and works of many of the targeted authors are still popular today , others like german writers maria leitner and georg hermann have virtually been forgotten . this shows that in some ways the book burning had a long-term effect , according to olaf zimmermann , managing director of the german council of culture . " yes , it 's disgraceful , but the sad fact is that many authors whose books landed on the bonfires have faded into obscurity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertholt brecht 's work was burned as " degenerate " ...
passages from some of their works will be read out at the weekend events , he said . berlin 's renowned humboldt library and the spanish cultural institute , cervantes , are jointly hosting readings and recitals from the burned works on saturday . " empty library " commemoration the event takes place on the same square where some 40,000 nazi supporters gathered three-quarters-of-a-century ago to witness the book burning in the german capital . today an underground memorial marks the spot on what is now august bebel platz .
conceived as an " empty library , " visitors can view it through a glass window built into the pavement . " it is the right monument in the right place , " according to klaus staeke , president of the academy of arts . records show that at least 35,000 books were burned in 22 cities between may and the end of august 1933 in an event unseen since the middle ages . in berlin , nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels delivered a midnight speech in which he said : " the era of jewish intellectualism is now at an end .
the soul of the german people can express itself again . " blacklists of " degenerates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... as were writings of the father of psychology , sigmund freud the students , who were at the vanguard of the nazi movement , compiled blacklists of undesirable authors and circulated them to public and private libraries . in addition to german-speaking authors , works of american writers jack london , ernest hemingway and helen keller were also consigned to the flames . the book burning was the last major orchestrated event in the early stages of hitler 's rule , following a purge of communists and trade unions and a nazi-organized boycott of jewish goods . guidelines for nazi writers it also marked the start of censorship and the introduction of propaganda ministry " guidelines " to which all writers were expected to adhere . within the space of days the german book trade published a list of 131 authors and ordered libraries and bookshops to cleanse their shelves of their works .

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .
eu presidency refuses to comment on report lithuanian foreign ministry spokeswoman violeta gaizauskaite would not comment on slovenia 's alleged ultimatum , but said vilnius would not change tack .

" the lithuanian position has not changed -lrb- on the eu-russia talks -rrb- .
we will discuss all these issues sunday in vilnius , " she added .
last month , vilnius unilaterally blocked attempts to kick off eu-russia talks , demanding that a number of sensitive issues , including energy security and relations with georgia , be included in the eu negotiating mandate .
lithuania , which joined the eu in 2004 , 13 years after breaking free from the crumbling communist bloc , is a strong supporter of fellow ex-soviet republic georgia .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

price on the rise since the end of 2007 while 2006 saw a steady fall to a low of 1.21 euros , since november of that year the course has been steadily upwards .
in a break-down of the price , the mwv mineral oil association said 65 cents of the price went to fuel tax with a further 24 cents taken in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- .
the product itself cost only 51 cents , while petrol stations were taking just under 10 cents a liter .

pressure works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists staged protests all over the world in support of tibet " i can only encourage every free society to keep up the pressure , " the dalai lama said , stressing that the talks with beijing had to be productive and not just symbolic .
they also had to be transparent - " an end to secret talks behind closed doors . "
the chinese had finally to agree that there was a problem in tibet .
on thursday , the european representative of the dalai lama criticized foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for failing to meet the tibetan leader when he visits germany next week .
tseten chhoekyapa said it was unfortunate that steinmeier had turned down the chance of a meeting on the grounds he had no time .
" we think he was badly advised , " chhoekyapa said in berlin .
the dalai lama is to hold speeches in four cities , with human rights as the main theme .
he is due meet the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert in bochum , and address the foreign affairs and human rights committees of the german parliament in berlin .
speech at the brandenburg gate on the final day of the visit , may 19 , the dalai lama plans to deliver a speech at the german capital 's landmark brandenburg gate , a spokesman for the german tibet initiative said .

the product itself cost only 51 cents , while petrol stations were taking just under 10 cents a liter .

" the two basic pillars of serbia 's foreign policy are eu integration and solid and close relations with russia , and these two agreements confirmed that , " foreign minister vuk jeremic , of the pro-european camp , later told a press conference .
kostunica said in a statement that his alliance chose to walk out for the vote on the eu accord because it was " anti-constitutional and against the state and national interests of serbia . "
the outgoing prime minister and other nationalists have vowed to block the eu deal , saying it gives back-door recognition to kosovo 's february declaration of independence from serbia .
kosovo has been recognized as a new nation by more than 40 countries , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu .

polls show the gap between anti-european and pro-european parties has narrowed since the saa was signed .
but the nationalist bloc led by kostunica and leader of main opposition radical party , tomislav nikolic , could win the most seats in the parliament .
the cabinet session was held even though a campaign blackout entered force overnight , ahead of sunday elections expected to give the ultra-nationalists their best shot at power since slobodan milosevic 's ouster in 2000 .
as it took place , more than 1,000 supporters of the pro-western liberal democratic party staged a noisy demonstration outside the government offices in belgrade to protest the russian deal .
energy deal unanimously agreed by both sides the russian energy deal , signed in january , includes plans for a strategic gas pipeline through serbia and the sale of 51 percent of state-owned oil monopoly nis to russian energy giant gazprom .
if adopted , it could eventually leave much of serbia 's energy sector in russian hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's party and partners voted for the power deal despite leaving the cabinet session over the saa , kostunica 's nationalists later returned to the meeting to vote on the energy deal with russia , which was unanimously accepted by both camps .
both the saa and energy agreement require approval by parliament , where finding a governing majority after sunday 's voting could take weeks .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , representing the presidency of the european union , sent a message to belgrade on friday reiterating the eu 's desire for serbia to become a member and said that the eu was ready to discuss its accession regardless of which bloc wins sunday elections .
eu assures serbia that accession will remain an option " the eu ca n't influence the result of elections , we only want serbia to become a member of the eu as soon as possible , " rupel told a news conference .
" if serbian voters elect nikolic , the radical party , we will talk with those who have been appointed to represent the serbian people . "

" serbia faces a critical decision this weekend , " rehn said in an interview with finnish national broadcaster yle .

" the two basic pillars of serbia 's foreign policy are eu integration and solid and close relations with russia , and these two agreements confirmed that , " foreign minister vuk jeremic , of the pro-european camp , later told a press conference .
kostunica said in a statement that his alliance chose to walk out for the vote on the eu accord because it was " anti-constitutional and against the state and national interests of serbia . "
the outgoing prime minister and other nationalists have vowed to block the eu deal , saying it gives back-door recognition to kosovo 's february declaration of independence from serbia .
kosovo has been recognized as a new nation by more than 40 countries , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu .
serbia and its ally russia refuse to recognize kosovo 's independence , declared unilaterally by its albanian-dominated parliament on feb .
17 .
the traumatic loss of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed nationalists ahead of the elections .
anti-europeans hold narrow lead ahead of election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic , left , faces a tough fight to keep his party in power as a result , the serbian radical party leads president boris tadic 's alliance of pro-european parties by a narrow margin in surveys and is expected to form a nationalist government with kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- .
polls show the gap between anti-european and pro-european parties has narrowed since the saa was signed .
but the nationalist bloc led by kostunica and leader of main opposition radical party , tomislav nikolic , could win the most seats in the parliament .
the cabinet session was held even though a campaign blackout entered force overnight , ahead of sunday elections expected to give the ultra-nationalists their best shot at power since slobodan milosevic 's ouster in 2000 .
as it took place , more than 1,000 supporters of the pro-western liberal democratic party staged a noisy demonstration outside the government offices in belgrade to protest the russian deal .
energy deal unanimously agreed by both sides the russian energy deal , signed in january , includes plans for a strategic gas pipeline through serbia and the sale of 51 percent of state-owned oil monopoly nis to russian energy giant gazprom .
if adopted , it could eventually leave much of serbia 's energy sector in russian hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's party and partners voted for the power deal despite leaving the cabinet session over the saa , kostunica 's nationalists later returned to the meeting to vote on the energy deal with russia , which was unanimously accepted by both camps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 10.05.2008 chancellor merkel pays tribute to germany 's " literary pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer fighting about who 'll get the word : angela merkel and marcel reich-ranicki chancellor angela merkel paid a tribute to germany 's best known and most feared literary critic who in many ways personified the restoration of cultural values in the country after world war ii . " the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .

" it was only a small step from isolating the jews to burning their books , and again a small step from the burning of the books to incinerating people , " koehler said . actors , authors and schoolchildren read from the works of some of the 130-odd authors whose works went up in flames , among them bertolt brecht , sigmund freund and thomas mann . some writers forever lost , organizer says but while the names and works of many of the targeted authors are still popular today , others like german writers maria leitner and georg hermann have virtually been forgotten . this shows that in some ways the book burning had a long-term effect , according to olaf zimmermann , managing director of the german council of culture . " yes , it 's disgraceful , but the sad fact is that many authors whose books landed on the bonfires have faded into obscurity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertholt brecht 's work was burned as " degenerate " ...
passages from some of their works will be read out at the weekend events , he said . berlin 's renowned humboldt library and the spanish cultural institute , cervantes , are jointly hosting readings and recitals from the burned works on saturday . " empty library " commemoration the event takes place on the same square where some 40,000 nazi supporters gathered three-quarters-of-a-century ago to witness the book burning in the german capital . today an underground memorial marks the spot on what is now august bebel platz .
conceived as an " empty library , " visitors can view it through a glass window built into the pavement . " it is the right monument in the right place , " according to klaus staeke , president of the academy of arts . records show that at least 35,000 books were burned in 22 cities between may and the end of august 1933 in an event unseen since the middle ages . in berlin , nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels delivered a midnight speech in which he said : " the era of jewish intellectualism is now at an end .
the soul of the german people can express itself again . " blacklists of " degenerates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... as were writings of the father of psychology , sigmund freud the students , who were at the vanguard of the nazi movement , compiled blacklists of undesirable authors and circulated them to public and private libraries . in addition to german-speaking authors , works of american writers jack london , ernest hemingway and helen keller were also consigned to the flames . the book burning was the last major orchestrated event in the early stages of hitler 's rule , following a purge of communists and trade unions and a nazi-organized boycott of jewish goods . guidelines for nazi writers it also marked the start of censorship and the introduction of propaganda ministry " guidelines " to which all writers were expected to adhere . within the space of days the german book trade published a list of 131 authors and ordered libraries and bookshops to cleanse their shelves of their works .

the dalai lama , who begins a four-day visit to germany on may 16 , told the magazine the negotiations were being held in an atmosphere that was " not aggressive but respectful . "
concrete proposals had been made for the next round of talks , he added .
the tibetan leader said he believed that chinese side had agreed to the talks under pressure from the protests in tibet in march and in fear that the beijing olympics , which begin in august , could be harmed .
pressure works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists staged protests all over the world in support of tibet " i can only encourage every free society to keep up the pressure , " the dalai lama said , stressing that the talks with beijing had to be productive and not just symbolic .

the chinese had finally to agree that there was a problem in tibet .
on thursday , the european representative of the dalai lama criticized foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier for failing to meet the tibetan leader when he visits germany next week .
tseten chhoekyapa said it was unfortunate that steinmeier had turned down the chance of a meeting on the grounds he had no time .
" we think he was badly advised , " chhoekyapa said in berlin .
the dalai lama is to hold speeches in four cities , with human rights as the main theme .
he is due meet the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert in bochum , and address the foreign affairs and human rights committees of the german parliament in berlin .

" the two basic pillars of serbia 's foreign policy are eu integration and solid and close relations with russia , and these two agreements confirmed that , " foreign minister vuk jeremic , of the pro-european camp , later told a press conference .
kostunica said in a statement that his alliance chose to walk out for the vote on the eu accord because it was " anti-constitutional and against the state and national interests of serbia . "
the outgoing prime minister and other nationalists have vowed to block the eu deal , saying it gives back-door recognition to kosovo 's february declaration of independence from serbia .
kosovo has been recognized as a new nation by more than 40 countries , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu .

polls show the gap between anti-european and pro-european parties has narrowed since the saa was signed .

the cabinet session was held even though a campaign blackout entered force overnight , ahead of sunday elections expected to give the ultra-nationalists their best shot at power since slobodan milosevic 's ouster in 2000 .

"
radical shiite group hezbollah and allies took control of broad parts of beirut on friday , laid siege to areas that included government buildings and clashed with security forces .
" the eu condemns the last acts of violence in the strongest terms and reaffirms its full support to the lebanese government , " solana said .
the eu 's top diplomat said any solution would have to come " through dialogue and within the national institutions . "
peaceful solution at least 20 people have been killed and over 50 wounded in the violence that erupted on wednesday .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier phoned lebanese premier fouad seniora on friday to express his concern at what he termed " the escalation of violence . "
" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "
new casualties at least four people were killed and 20 wounded in beirut on saturday when unidentified gunmen fired at a funeral procession of a sunni muslim man killed in the ongoing clashes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 10.05.2008 chancellor merkel pays tribute to germany 's " literary pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer fighting about who 'll get the word : angela merkel and marcel reich-ranicki chancellor angela merkel paid a tribute to germany 's best known and most feared literary critic who in many ways personified the restoration of cultural values in the country after world war ii . " the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "

but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .
vfl wolfsburg jumped above stuttgart into sixth on goal difference and level with hamburg after thumping armin veh 's side 4-0 .

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .
vfl wolfsburg jumped above stuttgart into sixth on goal difference and level with hamburg after thumping armin veh 's side 4-0 .

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .
vfl wolfsburg jumped above stuttgart into sixth on goal difference and level with hamburg after thumping armin veh 's side 4-0 .

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .

last month , vilnius unilaterally blocked attempts to kick off eu-russia talks , demanding that a number of sensitive issues , including energy security and relations with georgia , be included in the eu negotiating mandate .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was only a small step from isolating the jews to burning their books , and again a small step from the burning of the books to incinerating people , " koehler said . actors , authors and schoolchildren read from the works of some of the 130-odd authors whose works went up in flames , among them bertolt brecht , sigmund freund and thomas mann . some writers forever lost , organizer says but while the names and works of many of the targeted authors are still popular today , others like german writers maria leitner and georg hermann have virtually been forgotten . this shows that in some ways the book burning had a long-term effect , according to olaf zimmermann , managing director of the german council of culture . " yes , it 's disgraceful , but the sad fact is that many authors whose books landed on the bonfires have faded into obscurity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertholt brecht 's work was burned as " degenerate " ...

" empty library " commemoration the event takes place on the same square where some 40,000 nazi supporters gathered three-quarters-of-a-century ago to witness the book burning in the german capital . today an underground memorial marks the spot on what is now august bebel platz .
conceived as an " empty library , " visitors can view it through a glass window built into the pavement . " it is the right monument in the right place , " according to klaus staeke , president of the academy of arts . records show that at least 35,000 books were burned in 22 cities between may and the end of august 1933 in an event unseen since the middle ages . in berlin , nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels delivered a midnight speech in which he said : " the era of jewish intellectualism is now at an end .
the soul of the german people can express itself again . " blacklists of " degenerates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... as were writings of the father of psychology , sigmund freud the students , who were at the vanguard of the nazi movement , compiled blacklists of undesirable authors and circulated them to public and private libraries . in addition to german-speaking authors , works of american writers jack london , ernest hemingway and helen keller were also consigned to the flames . the book burning was the last major orchestrated event in the early stages of hitler 's rule , following a purge of communists and trade unions and a nazi-organized boycott of jewish goods . guidelines for nazi writers it also marked the start of censorship and the introduction of propaganda ministry " guidelines " to which all writers were expected to adhere . within the space of days the german book trade published a list of 131 authors and ordered libraries and bookshops to cleanse their shelves of their works .

" the two basic pillars of serbia 's foreign policy are eu integration and solid and close relations with russia , and these two agreements confirmed that , " foreign minister vuk jeremic , of the pro-european camp , later told a press conference .
kostunica said in a statement that his alliance chose to walk out for the vote on the eu accord because it was " anti-constitutional and against the state and national interests of serbia . "
the outgoing prime minister and other nationalists have vowed to block the eu deal , saying it gives back-door recognition to kosovo 's february declaration of independence from serbia .

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .
eu presidency refuses to comment on report lithuanian foreign ministry spokeswoman violeta gaizauskaite would not comment on slovenia 's alleged ultimatum , but said vilnius would not change tack .
" the plans for the mission to georgia have not changed .
lithuania 's foreign minister petras vaitiekunas is due to go to georgia on monday and he hopes the four other ministers will join him , " gaizauskaite told reporters .
" the lithuanian position has not changed -lrb- on the eu-russia talks -rrb- .
we will discuss all these issues sunday in vilnius , " she added .
last month , vilnius unilaterally blocked attempts to kick off eu-russia talks , demanding that a number of sensitive issues , including energy security and relations with georgia , be included in the eu negotiating mandate .
lithuania , which joined the eu in 2004 , 13 years after breaking free from the crumbling communist bloc , is a strong supporter of fellow ex-soviet republic georgia .

foreign ministers from five eu member state - slovenia , sweden , poland , lithuania and latvia - are expected to travel to tbilisi to try to mediate between georgia and russia .
the ministers are scheduled to assemble in vilnius on sunday and leave for georgia on monday .
the eu is hoping talks with russia on the pact - which is meant to keep relations between the eu and moscow on an even keel - can be launched at an eu-russia summit in siberia on june 26-27 .
the mandate for eu talks with russia is to be discussed at the next eu foreign ministers ' meeting on may 26 , where the pressure on lithuania to give way is likely to be high .

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .

munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

price on the rise since the end of 2007 while 2006 saw a steady fall to a low of 1.21 euros , since november of that year the course has been steadily upwards .
in a break-down of the price , the mwv mineral oil association said 65 cents of the price went to fuel tax with a further 24 cents taken in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- .
the product itself cost only 51 cents , while petrol stations were taking just under 10 cents a liter .

"
radical shiite group hezbollah and allies took control of broad parts of beirut on friday , laid siege to areas that included government buildings and clashed with security forces .
" the eu condemns the last acts of violence in the strongest terms and reaffirms its full support to the lebanese government , " solana said .
the eu 's top diplomat said any solution would have to come " through dialogue and within the national institutions . "
peaceful solution at least 20 people have been killed and over 50 wounded in the violence that erupted on wednesday .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier phoned lebanese premier fouad seniora on friday to express his concern at what he termed " the escalation of violence . "
" i urgently call on all parties to withdraw their armed factions , lay down their weapons and recognise the lebanese state 's exclusive right to use force , " steinmeier said in a statement .
" the developments of the last few days have shown that a resolution to the political conflict in lebanon can not wait any longer . "
new casualties at least four people were killed and 20 wounded in beirut on saturday when unidentified gunmen fired at a funeral procession of a sunni muslim man killed in the ongoing clashes .
a witness said that as the procession was heading to a cemetery on the outskirts of the sunni neighborhood of tarek al jadideh , they came under fire .
gunmen were later seen returning to the streets as army soldiers cordoned off the area .

" the two basic pillars of serbia 's foreign policy are eu integration and solid and close relations with russia , and these two agreements confirmed that , " foreign minister vuk jeremic , of the pro-european camp , later told a press conference .
kostunica said in a statement that his alliance chose to walk out for the vote on the eu accord because it was " anti-constitutional and against the state and national interests of serbia . "
the outgoing prime minister and other nationalists have vowed to block the eu deal , saying it gives back-door recognition to kosovo 's february declaration of independence from serbia .
kosovo has been recognized as a new nation by more than 40 countries , including the united states and all but a handful from the eu .
serbia and its ally russia refuse to recognize kosovo 's independence , declared unilaterally by its albanian-dominated parliament on feb .
17 .
the traumatic loss of the southern territory - viewed by most serbs as the cradle of their history , culture and orthodox christian religion - has buoyed nationalists ahead of the elections .
anti-europeans hold narrow lead ahead of election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic , left , faces a tough fight to keep his party in power as a result , the serbian radical party leads president boris tadic 's alliance of pro-european parties by a narrow margin in surveys and is expected to form a nationalist government with kostunica 's democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- .
polls show the gap between anti-european and pro-european parties has narrowed since the saa was signed .
but the nationalist bloc led by kostunica and leader of main opposition radical party , tomislav nikolic , could win the most seats in the parliament .
the cabinet session was held even though a campaign blackout entered force overnight , ahead of sunday elections expected to give the ultra-nationalists their best shot at power since slobodan milosevic 's ouster in 2000 .
as it took place , more than 1,000 supporters of the pro-western liberal democratic party staged a noisy demonstration outside the government offices in belgrade to protest the russian deal .
energy deal unanimously agreed by both sides the russian energy deal , signed in january , includes plans for a strategic gas pipeline through serbia and the sale of 51 percent of state-owned oil monopoly nis to russian energy giant gazprom .
if adopted , it could eventually leave much of serbia 's energy sector in russian hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's party and partners voted for the power deal despite leaving the cabinet session over the saa , kostunica 's nationalists later returned to the meeting to vote on the energy deal with russia , which was unanimously accepted by both camps .
both the saa and energy agreement require approval by parliament , where finding a governing majority after sunday 's voting could take weeks .
slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , representing the presidency of the european union , sent a message to belgrade on friday reiterating the eu 's desire for serbia to become a member and said that the eu was ready to discuss its accession regardless of which bloc wins sunday elections .
eu assures serbia that accession will remain an option " the eu ca n't influence the result of elections , we only want serbia to become a member of the eu as soon as possible , " rupel told a news conference .
" if serbian voters elect nikolic , the radical party , we will talk with those who have been appointed to represent the serbian people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn wants serbians to stay on the path to the eu in a separate statement , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn urged serbians to vote for pro-european candidates saying their victory " would be better for serbia and for europe . "
" serbia faces a critical decision this weekend , " rehn said in an interview with finnish national broadcaster yle .
" support between these two groups , the pro-european democratic group and the more rear-mirror looking nationalistic group , is rather even .

" it 's those people at the top who are spoiling it for the rest of us , " a woman motorist who declined to be named told national commercial broadcaster n-tv .
newspapers carried graphs showing how the price of petrol had risen from 80 cents a liter in 1998 to crash through 1.00 euro in early 2000 , 1.20 in 2004 and 1.35 in 2005 .
price on the rise since the end of 2007 while 2006 saw a steady fall to a low of 1.21 euros , since november of that year the course has been steadily upwards .
in a break-down of the price , the mwv mineral oil association said 65 cents of the price went to fuel tax with a further 24 cents taken in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- .
the product itself cost only 51 cents , while petrol stations were taking just under 10 cents a liter .
rainer bruederle , deputy leader of the opposition free-market fdp , blamed the german state .
" the real oil sheikhs are in berlin , " he told saturday 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
german automobile association -lrb- adac -rrb- deputy president ulrich klaus becker called on the government to consider cutting environmental taxes and to increase the tax allowance for traveling to work .
the surge in the petrol price came after oil broke the $ 125-a-barrel mark on friday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .
eu presidency refuses to comment on report lithuanian foreign ministry spokeswoman violeta gaizauskaite would not comment on slovenia 's alleged ultimatum , but said vilnius would not change tack .
" the plans for the mission to georgia have not changed .
lithuania 's foreign minister petras vaitiekunas is due to go to georgia on monday and he hopes the four other ministers will join him , " gaizauskaite told reporters .
" the lithuanian position has not changed -lrb- on the eu-russia talks -rrb- .
we will discuss all these issues sunday in vilnius , " she added .
last month , vilnius unilaterally blocked attempts to kick off eu-russia talks , demanding that a number of sensitive issues , including energy security and relations with georgia , be included in the eu negotiating mandate .
lithuania , which joined the eu in 2004 , 13 years after breaking free from the crumbling communist bloc , is a strong supporter of fellow ex-soviet republic georgia .

they reached new heights thursday as georgian president mikheil saakashvili warned of a risk of war with russia .
foreign ministers from five eu member state - slovenia , sweden , poland , lithuania and latvia - are expected to travel to tbilisi to try to mediate between georgia and russia .
the ministers are scheduled to assemble in vilnius on sunday and leave for georgia on monday .
the eu is hoping talks with russia on the pact - which is meant to keep relations between the eu and moscow on an even keel - can be launched at an eu-russia summit in siberia on june 26-27 .
the mandate for eu talks with russia is to be discussed at the next eu foreign ministers ' meeting on may 26 , where the pressure on lithuania to give way is likely to be high .
all of the eu 's 27 members must approve the start of negotiations with non-member states . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was only a small step from isolating the jews to burning their books , and again a small step from the burning of the books to incinerating people , " koehler said . actors , authors and schoolchildren read from the works of some of the 130-odd authors whose works went up in flames , among them bertolt brecht , sigmund freund and thomas mann . some writers forever lost , organizer says but while the names and works of many of the targeted authors are still popular today , others like german writers maria leitner and georg hermann have virtually been forgotten . this shows that in some ways the book burning had a long-term effect , according to olaf zimmermann , managing director of the german council of culture . " yes , it 's disgraceful , but the sad fact is that many authors whose books landed on the bonfires have faded into obscurity , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertholt brecht 's work was burned as " degenerate " ...
passages from some of their works will be read out at the weekend events , he said . berlin 's renowned humboldt library and the spanish cultural institute , cervantes , are jointly hosting readings and recitals from the burned works on saturday . " empty library " commemoration the event takes place on the same square where some 40,000 nazi supporters gathered three-quarters-of-a-century ago to witness the book burning in the german capital . today an underground memorial marks the spot on what is now august bebel platz .
conceived as an " empty library , " visitors can view it through a glass window built into the pavement . " it is the right monument in the right place , " according to klaus staeke , president of the academy of arts . records show that at least 35,000 books were burned in 22 cities between may and the end of august 1933 in an event unseen since the middle ages . in berlin , nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels delivered a midnight speech in which he said : " the era of jewish intellectualism is now at an end .
the soul of the german people can express itself again . " blacklists of " degenerates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... as were writings of the father of psychology , sigmund freud the students , who were at the vanguard of the nazi movement , compiled blacklists of undesirable authors and circulated them to public and private libraries . in addition to german-speaking authors , works of american writers jack london , ernest hemingway and helen keller were also consigned to the flames . the book burning was the last major orchestrated event in the early stages of hitler 's rule , following a purge of communists and trade unions and a nazi-organized boycott of jewish goods . guidelines for nazi writers it also marked the start of censorship and the introduction of propaganda ministry " guidelines " to which all writers were expected to adhere . within the space of days the german book trade published a list of 131 authors and ordered libraries and bookshops to cleanse their shelves of their works .

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .
munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .
the home side continued to press in the hope of an equalizer but bayern comfortably held on to end duisburg 's sojourn in the bundesliga .
bielefeld 's fate in own hands with the bottom three all losing , arminia bielefeld could have ensured safety with victory over borussia dortmund but michael frontzeck 's side could only manage 2-2 draw .
thorben marx put bielefeld in front from the penalty spot after 24 minutes but delron buckley leveled matters just four minutes later .
artur wichniarek restored the home side 's lead with a header on 34 minutes and their cause was further helped with the dismissal of dortmund 's robert kovac with 12 minutes remaining .
however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .
nuremberg have a vastly superior goal difference so could still survive by beating schalke 04 and hoping bielefeld lose or draw against stuttgart .
werder hit six to tighten grip on second werder bremen , already assured of champions league football next season thanks to the midweek win over vfl bochum , cemented their hold on second spot with a comprehensive 6-1 victory over hanover 96 .
hugo almeida opened the scoring for bremen with a simple tap-in on 14 minutes while naldo doubled the home side 's lead 13 minutes later , heading home unmarked front close range .
second-half goals from tim borowski , ivan klasnic , markus rosenburg and aaron hunt made it six without reply for bremen before a late effort from szabolcs huszti for hanover .
schalke remain third , two points behind bremen , after a mladen krstajic goal secured a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt while sv hamburg drop one place to fifth behind leverkusen on goal difference after losing 2-0 at energie cottbus , a result that removes the eastern german side from the relegation battle .

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .
eu presidency refuses to comment on report lithuanian foreign ministry spokeswoman violeta gaizauskaite would not comment on slovenia 's alleged ultimatum , but said vilnius would not change tack .
" the plans for the mission to georgia have not changed .
lithuania 's foreign minister petras vaitiekunas is due to go to georgia on monday and he hopes the four other ministers will join him , " gaizauskaite told reporters .
" the lithuanian position has not changed -lrb- on the eu-russia talks -rrb- .
we will discuss all these issues sunday in vilnius , " she added .
last month , vilnius unilaterally blocked attempts to kick off eu-russia talks , demanding that a number of sensitive issues , including energy security and relations with georgia , be included in the eu negotiating mandate .
lithuania , which joined the eu in 2004 , 13 years after breaking free from the crumbling communist bloc , is a strong supporter of fellow ex-soviet republic georgia .

they reached new heights thursday as georgian president mikheil saakashvili warned of a risk of war with russia .
foreign ministers from five eu member state - slovenia , sweden , poland , lithuania and latvia - are expected to travel to tbilisi to try to mediate between georgia and russia .
the ministers are scheduled to assemble in vilnius on sunday and leave for georgia on monday .
the eu is hoping talks with russia on the pact - which is meant to keep relations between the eu and moscow on an even keel - can be launched at an eu-russia summit in siberia on june 26-27 .
the mandate for eu talks with russia is to be discussed at the next eu foreign ministers ' meeting on may 26 , where the pressure on lithuania to give way is likely to be high .
all of the eu 's 27 members must approve the start of negotiations with non-member states . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 10.05.2008 chancellor merkel pays tribute to germany 's " literary pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer fighting about who 'll get the word : angela merkel and marcel reich-ranicki chancellor angela merkel paid a tribute to germany 's best known and most feared literary critic who in many ways personified the restoration of cultural values in the country after world war ii . " the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .
eu presidency refuses to comment on report lithuanian foreign ministry spokeswoman violeta gaizauskaite would not comment on slovenia 's alleged ultimatum , but said vilnius would not change tack .
" the plans for the mission to georgia have not changed .
lithuania 's foreign minister petras vaitiekunas is due to go to georgia on monday and he hopes the four other ministers will join him , " gaizauskaite told reporters .
" the lithuanian position has not changed -lrb- on the eu-russia talks -rrb- .
we will discuss all these issues sunday in vilnius , " she added .
last month , vilnius unilaterally blocked attempts to kick off eu-russia talks , demanding that a number of sensitive issues , including energy security and relations with georgia , be included in the eu negotiating mandate .
lithuania , which joined the eu in 2004 , 13 years after breaking free from the crumbling communist bloc , is a strong supporter of fellow ex-soviet republic georgia .

they reached new heights thursday as georgian president mikheil saakashvili warned of a risk of war with russia .
foreign ministers from five eu member state - slovenia , sweden , poland , lithuania and latvia - are expected to travel to tbilisi to try to mediate between georgia and russia .
the ministers are scheduled to assemble in vilnius on sunday and leave for georgia on monday .
the eu is hoping talks with russia on the pact - which is meant to keep relations between the eu and moscow on an even keel - can be launched at an eu-russia summit in siberia on june 26-27 .
the mandate for eu talks with russia is to be discussed at the next eu foreign ministers ' meeting on may 26 , where the pressure on lithuania to give way is likely to be high .

" how such a trade can be offered ? " asked the ministry source , who bns said had spoken on condition of anonymity .
" it is difficult to understand whether slovenia , which presides over the eu , is expressing the attitude of the eu towards georgia , or whether it is just an inapt proposal by slovenia in an attempt to force lithuania to withdraw its justified demands in the discussions on the mandate for the eu talks with russia on the strategic partnership , " the source said .
eu presidency refuses to comment on report lithuanian foreign ministry spokeswoman violeta gaizauskaite would not comment on slovenia 's alleged ultimatum , but said vilnius would not change tack .
" the plans for the mission to georgia have not changed .
lithuania 's foreign minister petras vaitiekunas is due to go to georgia on monday and he hopes the four other ministers will join him , " gaizauskaite told reporters .
" the lithuanian position has not changed -lrb- on the eu-russia talks -rrb- .
we will discuss all these issues sunday in vilnius , " she added .
last month , vilnius unilaterally blocked attempts to kick off eu-russia talks , demanding that a number of sensitive issues , including energy security and relations with georgia , be included in the eu negotiating mandate .
lithuania , which joined the eu in 2004 , 13 years after breaking free from the crumbling communist bloc , is a strong supporter of fellow ex-soviet republic georgia .

they reached new heights thursday as georgian president mikheil saakashvili warned of a risk of war with russia .
foreign ministers from five eu member state - slovenia , sweden , poland , lithuania and latvia - are expected to travel to tbilisi to try to mediate between georgia and russia .
the ministers are scheduled to assemble in vilnius on sunday and leave for georgia on monday .
the eu is hoping talks with russia on the pact - which is meant to keep relations between the eu and moscow on an even keel - can be launched at an eu-russia summit in siberia on june 26-27 .
the mandate for eu talks with russia is to be discussed at the next eu foreign ministers ' meeting on may 26 , where the pressure on lithuania to give way is likely to be high .

munich took to the field at duisburg 's msv arena in relaxed mood having secured their 21st german league title last weekend and wasted no time in exerting control over proceedings as andreas ottl made it 1-0 after just three minutes with a shot from the edge of the area .
duisburg 's defense then self-imploded , twice allowing german international lucas podolski time and space in the area , and paid the price both times to lie 3-0 down with only 20 minutes gone .
mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .

however , rowen fernandez made it 2-2 five minutes later after an alexander frei free kick came back off a post .
the draw leaves bielefeld on 33 points , two clear of nuremberg , meaning victory in their final game away to vfb stuttgart will guarantee bundesliga soccer next season .

second placed bremen thrashed hanover to consolidate their place as runners-up . bottom side hansa rostock 's fate was also secured as two penalties helped bayer leverkusen to a 2-1 win while nuremberg 's hopes of retaining top-flight status hang by a thread after going down 1-0 to a rafael goal at hertha berlin .

mihai tararache pulled one back for duisburg two minutes after the restart with a well-struck effort from 22 minutes and markus daun reduced the deficit to 3-2 just seven minutes later with a fortunate deflected shot that looped over oliver kahn in the bayern goal .

" it 's those people at the top who are spoiling it for the rest of us , " a woman motorist who declined to be named told national commercial broadcaster n-tv .
newspapers carried graphs showing how the price of petrol had risen from 80 cents a liter in 1998 to crash through 1.00 euro in early 2000 , 1.20 in 2004 and 1.35 in 2005 .
price on the rise since the end of 2007 while 2006 saw a steady fall to a low of 1.21 euros , since november of that year the course has been steadily upwards .
in a break-down of the price , the mwv mineral oil association said 65 cents of the price went to fuel tax with a further 24 cents taken in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- .
the product itself cost only 51 cents , while petrol stations were taking just under 10 cents a liter .
rainer bruederle , deputy leader of the opposition free-market fdp , blamed the german state .
" the real oil sheikhs are in berlin , " he told saturday 's frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
german automobile association -lrb- adac -rrb- deputy president ulrich klaus becker called on the government to consider cutting environmental taxes and to increase the tax allowance for traveling to work .
the surge in the petrol price came after oil broke the $ 125-a-barrel mark on friday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about .

concrete proposals had been made for the next round of talks , he added .
the tibetan leader said he believed that chinese side had agreed to the talks under pressure from the protests in tibet in march and in fear that the beijing olympics , which begin in august , could be harmed .
pressure works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists staged protests all over the world in support of tibet " i can only encourage every free society to keep up the pressure , " the dalai lama said , stressing that the talks with beijing had to be productive and not just symbolic .

" the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it closes a 70-million-year gap in the evolutionary record of a group of creatures known as the echinoderms which live on the sea bottom and have protective spikes .
some evolutionary theorists have suggested that vertebrate creatures including mankind are cousins of the echinoderms .
until its discovery in wuppertal , germany , no carpoid had been known between 390 million and 320 million years ago , geologist hans martin weber of the rhineland local authority said in cologne on friday .
the amateur palaeontologist found several fragments up to 1.2 centimetres in size of the creature 's shell and fore end in some rock exposed after a kindergarten had been ripped down .
he took them to weber to identify .
geologist weber said the rock had once been silt at the bottom of a tropical sea .
other fossils found in the rock were the first of their types in germany .
weber said the site had been well known to fossil hunters for 100 years and it was amazing no one had seen the echinoderm before . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 10.05.2008 chancellor merkel pays tribute to germany 's " literary pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer fighting about who 'll get the word : angela merkel and marcel reich-ranicki chancellor angela merkel paid a tribute to germany 's best known and most feared literary critic who in many ways personified the restoration of cultural values in the country after world war ii . " the time is ripe to honor an icon , " said merkel in her speech praising the extraordinary career of marcel reich-ranicki .
the german news magazine stern awarded a lifetime achievement award to the 87-year-old literary critic at its annual gala event held for some 1,200 prominent guests at the hamburg schauspielhaus theatre on friday .
" reich-ranicki 's oeuvre is not simply the sum of all the powerfully eloquent eulogies and damning reviews in his 50-year career , " merkel said .
" -lsb- he -rsb- inhabits culture and wants everybody else to participate in his passion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a young man , reich-ranicki spent three years in the warsaw ghetto for many germans , reich-ranicki - the son of a polish jew and grandson of a german rabbi , who spent three years in the warsaw ghetto during world war ii and later served as a volunteer in the polish army - symbolizes the way in which germany managed to rebuild itself as a pluralist society after the horrors of the nazi period .
he has also been seen as a beacon of high culture in a globalized society increasingly preoccupied with commercial success and mass-produced entertainment .
" my wife and i survived thanks to literature , poetry and music , " the critic said in response to merkel 's speech .
after a brief stunt in the polish communist party following the end of the war , reich-ranicki returned to germany in 1958 to pursue what would be a stellar career and to become , in the words of a colleague , " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic . "
who would have thought ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the age of 87 , reich-ranicki is still an engaging public speaker visibly moved by the chancellor 's speech , the critic - who is often jokingly referred to as germany 's " literary pope " - told an anecdote about how he once had dinner with young politician angela merkel in bonn .
" she did n't let me get a word in edgewise , " he said .
" and that requires some skill . "
in his long and prolific career , reich-ranicki has also become a media star , in part thanks to the popular , high-brow television show " literary quartet , " in which 4 literary critics discussed and fought about the merits of contemporary literature .
his popularity and success , however , came to him as a bit of surprise .
" i never expected that i would one day become a literary critic in germany , " he said .
" and i believe , mrs. merkel also never expected to become chancellor . "
merkel , who is a physicist by training , grew up in the former east germany .
a bad-tempered star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he did n't like a book , he made sure everybody heard that numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic .
in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel " das weite feld " -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . "
the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel " tod eines kritkers " -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death .
" i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" -lsb- i am also -rsb- the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . "
a man of 20th century bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki does n't seem to have warmed up to the 21st century in many ways , however , reich-ranicki remains a man of the past century .
when asked in a recent interview for his thoughts about the proliferation of lay criticism on the internet and numerous reader reviews which appear on various commercial web portals and online booksellers such as amazon , he responded : " my dear , do n't get mad at me , but i have no idea what you 're talking about . "
germany 's " literary pope " claims that he has never visited the web site dedicated to his work -lrb- reich-ranicki.com -rrb- and that he never uses the internet .
" when i need something from the internet , i ask my secretary to get it for me , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the eastern virginia medical school study of 5,000 families found language development in children whose mothers had similar symptoms seemed unaffected .

men may not be likely to seek help for themselves but when other people who depend on them become affected , that may change the landscape james paulson eastern virginia medical school the researchers , led by paediatric psychologist james paulson , surveyed about 5,000 families .
when the children were nine months old , 14 % of the mothers and 10 % of the fathers were clinically depressed .
the researchers assessed the impact on language development by measuring what proportion of 50 common words the children were using at two years of age .
on average the children in the study were using 29 of the 50 words by the time they reached two .
' significant difference ' however , those children whose fathers were depressed when they were nine months old used an average of 1.5 fewer words than those whose fathers were fine .
dr paulson said the difference might seem small , but when scaled up across a child 's complete vocabulary it might make a significant difference .
in contrast , there was no difference in the size of the vocabulary of children whose mothers were depressed , and of those whose mothers were not .
the researchers found that depressed mothers did not reduce the amount of time they spent reading to their nine-month-old baby , but depressed fathers read on average 9 % less than those who had no problem .
dr paulson , who presented the findings to a meeting of the american psychiatric association , said he hoped the study would encourage depressed fathers to seek help .

the raids took place in hakkari province , which borders iraq and iran .
the military says it bombed positions of the pkk rebel group in response to an attack in the area in which two of its soldiers were killed on friday .
the pkk , which is seeking autonomy for kurds in south-eastern turkey , is designated as a terrorist organisation by turkey , the us and eu .
more than 30,000 people have been killed since the group began its armed campaign in 1984 .
turkey has launched a number of attacks against alleged pkk bases in recent months , several of them across the border in iraq .
turkey has accused iraq of failing to stop the rebels using its territory as a safe haven .

her disclosure is made in an interview with the times newspaper to coincide with its serialisation of her autobiography , speaking for myself .
in one extract from the book , she reveals how her husband suffered a crisis of confidence over the iraq war .
but she writes he decided to stay on as pm to fight for his domestic legacy .
' rattling the keys ' during 10 years in downing street , mrs blair , the former prime minister 's wife , continued her high-flying legal career and became a high profile media figure in her own right .
over the years she was in the headlines almost as much as her husband , and not always for the reasons she would have liked .
the book , to be published later this month , gives her account of the widely reported tensions between herself and the then chancellor , gordon brown , and explains why her husband chose not to stand down before the 2005 general election .
in it , she accuses mr brown of " rattling the keys " of downing street over mr blair 's head to try to force him out .
and she says mr blair would have stood down in 2005 if only mr brown had been prepared to back his public service reforms .
instead , she says he decided that he had to stay on in order to entrench his plans for city academies , foundation hospitals , and pensions reform .
in other extracts from the book and the interview , she says : the leadership deal that mr blair and mr brown struck happened at a neighbour 's home , not at the granita restaurant in islington as was widely reported mr blair used to tell mr brown to get married if he wanted to be leader mr brown , as the new chancellor , was wrong to announce he was not going to take a salary increase , thereby putting pressure on others to follow suit .
" how dare gordon do that ?
what did he know about financial commitments ?
he was a bachelor living on his own in a flat with a small mortgage , " she writes .
she said the blairs had " a mortgage the size of mount snowdon " on their £ 3.6m house in london 's connaught square .
" that was very scary .
whatever happened , we had to meet the monthly payment and it was down to me .
because no one else was going to meet it , were they ? "
" the problem between me and gordon is not anything personal .
it is because i thought my husband was the best person for the job and it is a damn difficult job . "
it was her idea for carole caplin , her lifestyle guru , to give mr blair massages and it was ms caplin who " kept her thin " mrs blair 's book had been scheduled for publication in autumn .
its surprise early release comes at a difficult time for the labour government which suffered substantial losses in the recent local elections .
