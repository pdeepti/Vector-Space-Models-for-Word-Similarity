" this quantity is enough to supply electricity to at least 780,000 households , " rwe said . the company is in negotiations with german wind-turbine company repower , mainly owned by suzlon of india , to build the towers , each with a capacity of 5 to 6 megawatts . rwe has taken over the project from a smaller company and has renamed the farm " innogy nordsee 1 . " building far out at sea the water in the 150-square-kilometre zone , 40 kilometers north of the north sea island of juist , is 26 to 34 meters deep . rwe said german rules force it to build further out to sea than in another nations which use offshore wind . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land . the first wind turbines should start running as early as 2011 , the company said .
the total investment for the project would be around 2.8 billion euros , rwe chief executive juergen grossmann said . germany lagging in offshore plans with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world . last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology - increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . so far , 19 smaller offshore farms have been approved , but work is only just starting on the first of them . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . environmentalists and tourism groups generally oppose projects close to shore , calling them eyesores . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this quantity is enough to supply electricity to at least 780,000 households , " rwe said . the company is in negotiations with german wind-turbine company repower , mainly owned by suzlon of india , to build the towers , each with a capacity of 5 to 6 megawatts . rwe has taken over the project from a smaller company and has renamed the farm " innogy nordsee 1 . " building far out at sea the water in the 150-square-kilometre zone , 40 kilometers north of the north sea island of juist , is 26 to 34 meters deep . rwe said german rules force it to build further out to sea than in another nations which use offshore wind . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land . the first wind turbines should start running as early as 2011 , the company said .
the total investment for the project would be around 2.8 billion euros , rwe chief executive juergen grossmann said . germany lagging in offshore plans with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world . last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology - increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . so far , 19 smaller offshore farms have been approved , but work is only just starting on the first of them . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . environmentalists and tourism groups generally oppose projects close to shore , calling them eyesores . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" she said that her government aimed to " create a favorable situation " for germany in the current difficult economic environment .
going into pep talk mode , merkel added : " we know that we can only do this by working together .
but i 'm convinced that we can do it . " the german government has been discussing a second stimulus package that it says it will release in january .
that follows an existing 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 32.5 billion -rrb- program that many critics at home and abroad have criticized as being too cautious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck and chancellor merkel are softening their critical stances toward more economic stimulus merkel and her finance minister , peer steinbrueck , have been accused of not taking bold enough action in the face of the global financial meltdown by resisting stronger stimulus measures .
merkel and steinbrueck have thus far ruled out tax cuts , although other conservative politicians in germany have called for them . germany is not saddled with the levels of debt as are some other european countries , such as the uk , and the country 's public finances are in fairly good shape .
while germany seemed to avoid much of the fallout from the global credit squeeze at the ouset , more recent signs point to germany being anything but immune . business confidence has wilted to record low levels while manufacturing orders and industrial prices have tumbled .
the world 's biggest exporter has slipped into recession and could face its worst post-war contraction if it shrinks as much four percent in 2009 , as leading economists have forecast . change of heart the latest bad news have appeared to cause a change of heart in berlin , with steinbrueck 's once staunch opposition to further stimulus packages softening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government and industry heads got together this month in berlin to discuss the financial and economic crisis " i 'm aware that we ca n't keep the door to the vault locked - otherwise it 'll be kicked down in panic by other people , " steinbrueck said in an interview in the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" but what we want to avoid is having to roll out new stimulus measures on a monthly basis . " in her video message saturday , merkel said a second stimulus package must be " carefully prepared " to ensure that it saves or creates jobs .
she added : " our goal is to make germany fitter , after the crisis , for 21st century challenges . " she and steinbrueck have said additional money from the government should be invested in infrastructure projects such as roads , communication networks , education , and energy efficiency . the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper reported on saturday , dec .

merkel and steinbrueck have thus far ruled out tax cuts , although other conservative politicians in germany have called for them . germany is not saddled with the levels of debt as are some other european countries , such as the uk , and the country 's public finances are in fairly good shape .
while germany seemed to avoid much of the fallout from the global credit squeeze at the ouset , more recent signs point to germany being anything but immune . business confidence has wilted to record low levels while manufacturing orders and industrial prices have tumbled .
the world 's biggest exporter has slipped into recession and could face its worst post-war contraction if it shrinks as much four percent in 2009 , as leading economists have forecast . change of heart the latest bad news have appeared to cause a change of heart in berlin , with steinbrueck 's once staunch opposition to further stimulus packages softening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government and industry heads got together this month in berlin to discuss the financial and economic crisis " i 'm aware that we ca n't keep the door to the vault locked - otherwise it 'll be kicked down in panic by other people , " steinbrueck said in an interview in the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" but what we want to avoid is having to roll out new stimulus measures on a monthly basis . " in her video message saturday , merkel said a second stimulus package must be " carefully prepared " to ensure that it saves or creates jobs .
she added : " our goal is to make germany fitter , after the crisis , for 21st century challenges . " she and steinbrueck have said additional money from the government should be invested in infrastructure projects such as roads , communication networks , education , and energy efficiency . the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper reported on saturday , dec .

" the number of employees will go from some 1,800 to about 1,000 over the next three years , " the bank said in a statement .
" two-thirds of the jobs which are to go will be outside germany , " the bank said , adding that it intended to sell some of its activities .
the munich-based bank said about 800 jobs would be slashed by 2011 in a first step , adding it would take pains to avoid redundancies .
two thirds of the planned job cuts will take place outside germany , the bank said .
hypo real estate and its irish subsidiary depfa were caught up in a liquidity crunch that worsened after the us investment bank lehman brothers declared bankruptcy in september .
hypo real estate has already benefited from tens of billions of euros in a rescue plan worked out by the government and the german central bank since october .
under investigation for fraud the troubled bank is also being investigated for fraud .
earlier this week , prosecutors searched the apartments and office of hypo real estate 's former board chairman georg funke and supervisory board president klaus viermetz , both of whom resigned in early october .
the searches were made owing to " suspicion of inexact presentation , market manipulation and charges of fraud , " according to the munich prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

historical obligations the german government and leaders of the sinti and roma communities agreed in may 2006 to build the memorial , but a dispute over its inscription and design issues put the project on ice .
differences were finally overcome early this year , enabling the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , to approve the monument commemorating the murder of at least 500,000 members of the two ethnic minorities in nazi extermination camps .
speaking at the inauguration ceremony , the minister in charge of culture said germany lived up to its historical obligations to those persecuted as " gypsies " under the nazis .
bernd neumann said the groundbreaking ceremony took place on the 66th anniversary of the nazi decree under which sinti and roma were deported to the extermination camp of auschwitz .
" the memorial will show the important position these crimes hold in germany 's memory , " culture minister bernd neumann said at a ceremony including groups representing the victims .
" the guilt can not die away , " he said .
among those present at the ceremony were the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma , romani rose , designer karavan and the governing mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

the total investment for the project would be around 2.8 billion euros , rwe chief executive juergen grossmann said . germany lagging in offshore plans with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world . last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology - increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . so far , 19 smaller offshore farms have been approved , but work is only just starting on the first of them . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . environmentalists and tourism groups generally oppose projects close to shore , calling them eyesores . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have never had a policy of targeting the pound , " yvette cooper , a cabinet minister and close adviser of brown told journalists curtly .
she recalled that attempts by previous british governments to meddle with exchange rates had been " unsuccessful , " in what was a clear reference to the sterling 's ejection from the european exchange rate mechanism in 1992 .
now , as then , currency speculators are stoking the fire by seeking to make hefty gains from bets they place against the pound .
the sterling , which this week hit a record-low exchange rate of 1.05 against the euro , has lost a quarter of its value against both the euro and the us dollar since the summer .
analysts predict that parity could be reached against the euro zone currency early in the new year .
while tourists , exporters and hoteliers rejoice at the trend , british holidaymakers are wincing at their currency 's near-balance with the euro , which britain refused to adopt in 1999 .
worst yet to come for pound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over britain adopting the euro is still raging while the government maintains that the sterling 's downward trend will be halted as european economies weaken further , analysts believe that there is worse to come for the stricken currency .
" this is likely to get worse as more investors lose confidence in the pound amid fears about the uk economy , " said mark o 'sullivan , a dealing director at foreign exchange specialists currencies direct .
martin slaney , head of derivatives at gft global markets , a provider of derivatives trading services , agreed : " the euro is becoming the darling of the currency markets and there 's no confidence in the pound .
i would not be surprised if it hit parity with the euro and even falls below that . "
the government has so far reacted calmly to signs that there could be a full-blown run on the pound , maintaining its belief that the downward trend can not be sustained .
officials also point at evidence that the pound had , for a long time , been " overvalued . "
to join , or not to join bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downing street maintains it has no plans to move the uk closer to euro adoption however , the british currency 's decline has , inevitably , reignited the debate about whether or not britain should adopt the euro .
speculation was fuelled by eu chief jose manuel barroso who said recently that britain was now " closer to the euro than ever before . "
" i 'm not going to break the confidentiality of certain conversations , but some british politicians have already told me , ' if we had the euro , we would have been better off ' , " barroso said in an interview with french radio .
his remarks provoked an angry response from downing street .
" our position on the euro is the same .
we have no plans to join the euro , " a statement said .
officials have revealed that brown , who is a long-standing opponent of introducing the euro in britain , had made it clear to ministers that he would " not tolerate " a debate on the euro at present .
" officially , the euro debate is off the agenda , but unofficially , it 's in the anteroom , " said leading british economist will hutton . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" she said that her government aimed to " create a favorable situation " for germany in the current difficult economic environment .
going into pep talk mode , merkel added : " we know that we can only do this by working together .
but i 'm convinced that we can do it . " the german government has been discussing a second stimulus package that it says it will release in january .
that follows an existing 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 32.5 billion -rrb- program that many critics at home and abroad have criticized as being too cautious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck and chancellor merkel are softening their critical stances toward more economic stimulus merkel and her finance minister , peer steinbrueck , have been accused of not taking bold enough action in the face of the global financial meltdown by resisting stronger stimulus measures .
merkel and steinbrueck have thus far ruled out tax cuts , although other conservative politicians in germany have called for them . germany is not saddled with the levels of debt as are some other european countries , such as the uk , and the country 's public finances are in fairly good shape .
while germany seemed to avoid much of the fallout from the global credit squeeze at the ouset , more recent signs point to germany being anything but immune . business confidence has wilted to record low levels while manufacturing orders and industrial prices have tumbled .
the world 's biggest exporter has slipped into recession and could face its worst post-war contraction if it shrinks as much four percent in 2009 , as leading economists have forecast . change of heart the latest bad news have appeared to cause a change of heart in berlin , with steinbrueck 's once staunch opposition to further stimulus packages softening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government and industry heads got together this month in berlin to discuss the financial and economic crisis " i 'm aware that we ca n't keep the door to the vault locked - otherwise it 'll be kicked down in panic by other people , " steinbrueck said in an interview in the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" but what we want to avoid is having to roll out new stimulus measures on a monthly basis . " in her video message saturday , merkel said a second stimulus package must be " carefully prepared " to ensure that it saves or creates jobs .
she added : " our goal is to make germany fitter , after the crisis , for 21st century challenges . " she and steinbrueck have said additional money from the government should be invested in infrastructure projects such as roads , communication networks , education , and energy efficiency . the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper reported on saturday , dec .

" the number of employees will go from some 1,800 to about 1,000 over the next three years , " the bank said in a statement .
" two-thirds of the jobs which are to go will be outside germany , " the bank said , adding that it intended to sell some of its activities .
the munich-based bank said about 800 jobs would be slashed by 2011 in a first step , adding it would take pains to avoid redundancies .
two thirds of the planned job cuts will take place outside germany , the bank said .
hypo real estate and its irish subsidiary depfa were caught up in a liquidity crunch that worsened after the us investment bank lehman brothers declared bankruptcy in september .
hypo real estate has already benefited from tens of billions of euros in a rescue plan worked out by the government and the german central bank since october .
under investigation for fraud the troubled bank is also being investigated for fraud .
earlier this week , prosecutors searched the apartments and office of hypo real estate 's former board chairman georg funke and supervisory board president klaus viermetz , both of whom resigned in early october .
the searches were made owing to " suspicion of inexact presentation , market manipulation and charges of fraud , " according to the munich prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this quantity is enough to supply electricity to at least 780,000 households , " rwe said . the company is in negotiations with german wind-turbine company repower , mainly owned by suzlon of india , to build the towers , each with a capacity of 5 to 6 megawatts . rwe has taken over the project from a smaller company and has renamed the farm " innogy nordsee 1 . " building far out at sea the water in the 150-square-kilometre zone , 40 kilometers north of the north sea island of juist , is 26 to 34 meters deep . rwe said german rules force it to build further out to sea than in another nations which use offshore wind . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land . the first wind turbines should start running as early as 2011 , the company said .
the total investment for the project would be around 2.8 billion euros , rwe chief executive juergen grossmann said . germany lagging in offshore plans with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world . last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology - increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . so far , 19 smaller offshore farms have been approved , but work is only just starting on the first of them . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . environmentalists and tourism groups generally oppose projects close to shore , calling them eyesores . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the total investment for the project would be around 2.8 billion euros , rwe chief executive juergen grossmann said . germany lagging in offshore plans with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world . last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology - increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . so far , 19 smaller offshore farms have been approved , but work is only just starting on the first of them . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . environmentalists and tourism groups generally oppose projects close to shore , calling them eyesores . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the memorial will show the important position these crimes hold in germany 's memory , " culture minister bernd neumann said at a ceremony including groups representing the victims .
" the guilt can not die away , " he said .
among those present at the ceremony were the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma , romani rose , designer karavan and the governing mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

gm europe says it will still seek government help in europe . zurich-based gm europe said the aid package announced on friday , dec .
19 , would help stabilize the global auto industry , but added that european carmakers , itself included , would still seek emergency support from governments .
" while we are grateful that the us government has decided to back its auto industry , aggressive work continues here in europe to align the business with the significant downturn in the market , " gm europe said in a statement .
" we are continuing our discussions with key european governments , such as germany , about accessing credit lines on an expedited basis and expect to successfully conclude these discussions early in the new year , " the group said .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
germany backs loan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is waiting on aid to ensure its survival the german government greeted the us auto loan positively , confirming through its economy ministry that talks with gm 's german unit opel would resume early next year .
opel became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout when in november it asked berlin to back up loans valued at around 1 billion euros .
" this is a welcome breathing space for gm , " an economy ministry spokeswoman said friday .
" for opel , it is still the case that talks will continue at the start of the coming year and we will take into consideration the developments in the us . "
german chancellor angela merkel has expressed concerns over the possibility that funding by her government for opel could seep over to the carmaker 's us parent company gm .
in the uk , gm europe said friday it would be seeking government assistance for its vauxhall unit " within days . "
but british business secretary peter mandelson said wednesday , dec .
17 , that downing street would not support or run failed companies .
" i do n't have an open check book , " he said .
bildunterschrift : the chiefs of the ' big three ' can exhale now they 've got their government loans collapse of automakers unacceptable : bush in the us , tough conditions have been attached to the federal funds announced friday .
gm and chrysler will have to prove they can return to viability or the money could be withdrawn again by march 31 , likely leaving no option other than bankruptcy for the two auto firms .
the loan provides gm with $ 9.4 billion and chrysler with $ 4 billion over december and january .
gm could get another 4 billion dollars in february .
" in the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the us auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action , " us president george w bush said in a statement at the white house on friday .
gm and chrysler , who had warned they faced collapse without access to federal aid , welcomed the government 's decision and promised to use the funds to enact the painful restructuring moves demanded as a condition for the loan .
auto funds drawn from bank bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new car registrations are down from last year the funds will come from the $ 700-billion financial rescue package approved by congress in october , after attempts to provide the car industry with a separate aid package were blocked by republican legislators last week .
bush had previously refused to use funds from the financial rescue package , but said congress ' failure to act had left him with no other choice .
meanwhile , the outlook for a near-term recovery in global auto demand dimmed as europe saw a record fall in truck sales in november , with deliveries down 28 percent from october , the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- said in a statement thursday , dec .
18 .
the acea also reported that new car registrations had slumped in november by more than a quarter compared to the same month last year .

" we have never had a policy of targeting the pound , " yvette cooper , a cabinet minister and close adviser of brown told journalists curtly .
she recalled that attempts by previous british governments to meddle with exchange rates had been " unsuccessful , " in what was a clear reference to the sterling 's ejection from the european exchange rate mechanism in 1992 .
now , as then , currency speculators are stoking the fire by seeking to make hefty gains from bets they place against the pound .
the sterling , which this week hit a record-low exchange rate of 1.05 against the euro , has lost a quarter of its value against both the euro and the us dollar since the summer .
analysts predict that parity could be reached against the euro zone currency early in the new year .
while tourists , exporters and hoteliers rejoice at the trend , british holidaymakers are wincing at their currency 's near-balance with the euro , which britain refused to adopt in 1999 .
worst yet to come for pound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate over britain adopting the euro is still raging while the government maintains that the sterling 's downward trend will be halted as european economies weaken further , analysts believe that there is worse to come for the stricken currency .
" this is likely to get worse as more investors lose confidence in the pound amid fears about the uk economy , " said mark o 'sullivan , a dealing director at foreign exchange specialists currencies direct .
martin slaney , head of derivatives at gft global markets , a provider of derivatives trading services , agreed : " the euro is becoming the darling of the currency markets and there 's no confidence in the pound .
i would not be surprised if it hit parity with the euro and even falls below that . "
the government has so far reacted calmly to signs that there could be a full-blown run on the pound , maintaining its belief that the downward trend can not be sustained .
officials also point at evidence that the pound had , for a long time , been " overvalued . "
to join , or not to join bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downing street maintains it has no plans to move the uk closer to euro adoption however , the british currency 's decline has , inevitably , reignited the debate about whether or not britain should adopt the euro .
speculation was fuelled by eu chief jose manuel barroso who said recently that britain was now " closer to the euro than ever before . "
" i 'm not going to break the confidentiality of certain conversations , but some british politicians have already told me , ' if we had the euro , we would have been better off ' , " barroso said in an interview with french radio .
his remarks provoked an angry response from downing street .
" our position on the euro is the same .
we have no plans to join the euro , " a statement said .
officials have revealed that brown , who is a long-standing opponent of introducing the euro in britain , had made it clear to ministers that he would " not tolerate " a debate on the euro at present .
" officially , the euro debate is off the agenda , but unofficially , it 's in the anteroom , " said leading british economist will hutton . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the circular memorial in the shape of a fountain was designed by israeli sculptor dani karavan , and will have a poem by italian writer santino spinelli on its base .
historical obligations the german government and leaders of the sinti and roma communities agreed in may 2006 to build the memorial , but a dispute over its inscription and design issues put the project on ice .
differences were finally overcome early this year , enabling the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , to approve the monument commemorating the murder of at least 500,000 members of the two ethnic minorities in nazi extermination camps .
speaking at the inauguration ceremony , the minister in charge of culture said germany lived up to its historical obligations to those persecuted as " gypsies " under the nazis .
bernd neumann said the groundbreaking ceremony took place on the 66th anniversary of the nazi decree under which sinti and roma were deported to the extermination camp of auschwitz .
" the memorial will show the important position these crimes hold in germany 's memory , " culture minister bernd neumann said at a ceremony including groups representing the victims .
" the guilt can not die away , " he said .
among those present at the ceremony were the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma , romani rose , designer karavan and the governing mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

speaking at the inauguration ceremony , the minister in charge of culture said germany lived up to its historical obligations to those persecuted as " gypsies " under the nazis .
bernd neumann said the groundbreaking ceremony took place on the 66th anniversary of the nazi decree under which sinti and roma were deported to the extermination camp of auschwitz .
" the memorial will show the important position these crimes hold in germany 's memory , " culture minister bernd neumann said at a ceremony including groups representing the victims .
" the guilt can not die away , " he said .
among those present at the ceremony were the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma , romani rose , designer karavan and the governing mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

" the number of employees will go from some 1,800 to about 1,000 over the next three years , " the bank said in a statement .
" two-thirds of the jobs which are to go will be outside germany , " the bank said , adding that it intended to sell some of its activities .
the munich-based bank said about 800 jobs would be slashed by 2011 in a first step , adding it would take pains to avoid redundancies .
two thirds of the planned job cuts will take place outside germany , the bank said .
hypo real estate and its irish subsidiary depfa were caught up in a liquidity crunch that worsened after the us investment bank lehman brothers declared bankruptcy in september .
hypo real estate has already benefited from tens of billions of euros in a rescue plan worked out by the government and the german central bank since october .
under investigation for fraud the troubled bank is also being investigated for fraud .
earlier this week , prosecutors searched the apartments and office of hypo real estate 's former board chairman georg funke and supervisory board president klaus viermetz , both of whom resigned in early october .
the searches were made owing to " suspicion of inexact presentation , market manipulation and charges of fraud , " according to the munich prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this quantity is enough to supply electricity to at least 780,000 households , " rwe said . the company is in negotiations with german wind-turbine company repower , mainly owned by suzlon of india , to build the towers , each with a capacity of 5 to 6 megawatts . rwe has taken over the project from a smaller company and has renamed the farm " innogy nordsee 1 . " building far out at sea the water in the 150-square-kilometre zone , 40 kilometers north of the north sea island of juist , is 26 to 34 meters deep . rwe said german rules force it to build further out to sea than in another nations which use offshore wind . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land . the first wind turbines should start running as early as 2011 , the company said .
the total investment for the project would be around 2.8 billion euros , rwe chief executive juergen grossmann said . germany lagging in offshore plans with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world . last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology - increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . so far , 19 smaller offshore farms have been approved , but work is only just starting on the first of them . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . environmentalists and tourism groups generally oppose projects close to shore , calling them eyesores . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gm europe says it will still seek government help in europe . zurich-based gm europe said the aid package announced on friday , dec .
19 , would help stabilize the global auto industry , but added that european carmakers , itself included , would still seek emergency support from governments .
" while we are grateful that the us government has decided to back its auto industry , aggressive work continues here in europe to align the business with the significant downturn in the market , " gm europe said in a statement .
" we are continuing our discussions with key european governments , such as germany , about accessing credit lines on an expedited basis and expect to successfully conclude these discussions early in the new year , " the group said .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
germany backs loan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is waiting on aid to ensure its survival the german government greeted the us auto loan positively , confirming through its economy ministry that talks with gm 's german unit opel would resume early next year .
opel became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout when in november it asked berlin to back up loans valued at around 1 billion euros .
" this is a welcome breathing space for gm , " an economy ministry spokeswoman said friday .
" for opel , it is still the case that talks will continue at the start of the coming year and we will take into consideration the developments in the us . "
german chancellor angela merkel has expressed concerns over the possibility that funding by her government for opel could seep over to the carmaker 's us parent company gm .
in the uk , gm europe said friday it would be seeking government assistance for its vauxhall unit " within days . "
but british business secretary peter mandelson said wednesday , dec .
17 , that downing street would not support or run failed companies .
" i do n't have an open check book , " he said .
bildunterschrift : the chiefs of the ' big three ' can exhale now they 've got their government loans collapse of automakers unacceptable : bush in the us , tough conditions have been attached to the federal funds announced friday .
gm and chrysler will have to prove they can return to viability or the money could be withdrawn again by march 31 , likely leaving no option other than bankruptcy for the two auto firms .
the loan provides gm with $ 9.4 billion and chrysler with $ 4 billion over december and january .
gm could get another 4 billion dollars in february .
" in the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the us auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action , " us president george w bush said in a statement at the white house on friday .
gm and chrysler , who had warned they faced collapse without access to federal aid , welcomed the government 's decision and promised to use the funds to enact the painful restructuring moves demanded as a condition for the loan .
auto funds drawn from bank bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new car registrations are down from last year the funds will come from the $ 700-billion financial rescue package approved by congress in october , after attempts to provide the car industry with a separate aid package were blocked by republican legislators last week .
bush had previously refused to use funds from the financial rescue package , but said congress ' failure to act had left him with no other choice .
meanwhile , the outlook for a near-term recovery in global auto demand dimmed as europe saw a record fall in truck sales in november , with deliveries down 28 percent from october , the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- said in a statement thursday , dec .

gm europe says it will still seek government help in europe . zurich-based gm europe said the aid package announced on friday , dec .

" while we are grateful that the us government has decided to back its auto industry , aggressive work continues here in europe to align the business with the significant downturn in the market , " gm europe said in a statement .
" we are continuing our discussions with key european governments , such as germany , about accessing credit lines on an expedited basis and expect to successfully conclude these discussions early in the new year , " the group said .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
germany backs loan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is waiting on aid to ensure its survival the german government greeted the us auto loan positively , confirming through its economy ministry that talks with gm 's german unit opel would resume early next year .
opel became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout when in november it asked berlin to back up loans valued at around 1 billion euros .
" this is a welcome breathing space for gm , " an economy ministry spokeswoman said friday .
" for opel , it is still the case that talks will continue at the start of the coming year and we will take into consideration the developments in the us . "
german chancellor angela merkel has expressed concerns over the possibility that funding by her government for opel could seep over to the carmaker 's us parent company gm .
in the uk , gm europe said friday it would be seeking government assistance for its vauxhall unit " within days . "
but british business secretary peter mandelson said wednesday , dec .
17 , that downing street would not support or run failed companies .
" i do n't have an open check book , " he said .
bildunterschrift : the chiefs of the ' big three ' can exhale now they 've got their government loans collapse of automakers unacceptable : bush in the us , tough conditions have been attached to the federal funds announced friday .
gm and chrysler will have to prove they can return to viability or the money could be withdrawn again by march 31 , likely leaving no option other than bankruptcy for the two auto firms .
the loan provides gm with $ 9.4 billion and chrysler with $ 4 billion over december and january .
gm could get another 4 billion dollars in february .
" in the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the us auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action , " us president george w bush said in a statement at the white house on friday .
gm and chrysler , who had warned they faced collapse without access to federal aid , welcomed the government 's decision and promised to use the funds to enact the painful restructuring moves demanded as a condition for the loan .
auto funds drawn from bank bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new car registrations are down from last year the funds will come from the $ 700-billion financial rescue package approved by congress in october , after attempts to provide the car industry with a separate aid package were blocked by republican legislators last week .
bush had previously refused to use funds from the financial rescue package , but said congress ' failure to act had left him with no other choice .
meanwhile , the outlook for a near-term recovery in global auto demand dimmed as europe saw a record fall in truck sales in november , with deliveries down 28 percent from october , the european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- said in a statement thursday , dec .

the acea also reported that new car registrations had slumped in november by more than a quarter compared to the same month last year .

" she said that her government aimed to " create a favorable situation " for germany in the current difficult economic environment .
going into pep talk mode , merkel added : " we know that we can only do this by working together .
but i 'm convinced that we can do it . " the german government has been discussing a second stimulus package that it says it will release in january .
that follows an existing 23 billion euro -lrb- $ 32.5 billion -rrb- program that many critics at home and abroad have criticized as being too cautious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck and chancellor merkel are softening their critical stances toward more economic stimulus merkel and her finance minister , peer steinbrueck , have been accused of not taking bold enough action in the face of the global financial meltdown by resisting stronger stimulus measures .
merkel and steinbrueck have thus far ruled out tax cuts , although other conservative politicians in germany have called for them . germany is not saddled with the levels of debt as are some other european countries , such as the uk , and the country 's public finances are in fairly good shape .
while germany seemed to avoid much of the fallout from the global credit squeeze at the ouset , more recent signs point to germany being anything but immune . business confidence has wilted to record low levels while manufacturing orders and industrial prices have tumbled .
the world 's biggest exporter has slipped into recession and could face its worst post-war contraction if it shrinks as much four percent in 2009 , as leading economists have forecast . change of heart the latest bad news have appeared to cause a change of heart in berlin , with steinbrueck 's once staunch opposition to further stimulus packages softening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german government and industry heads got together this month in berlin to discuss the financial and economic crisis " i 'm aware that we ca n't keep the door to the vault locked - otherwise it 'll be kicked down in panic by other people , " steinbrueck said in an interview in the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" but what we want to avoid is having to roll out new stimulus measures on a monthly basis . " in her video message saturday , merkel said a second stimulus package must be " carefully prepared " to ensure that it saves or creates jobs .
she added : " our goal is to make germany fitter , after the crisis , for 21st century challenges . " she and steinbrueck have said additional money from the government should be invested in infrastructure projects such as roads , communication networks , education , and energy efficiency . the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper reported on saturday , dec .

the circular memorial in the shape of a fountain was designed by israeli sculptor dani karavan , and will have a poem by italian writer santino spinelli on its base .
historical obligations the german government and leaders of the sinti and roma communities agreed in may 2006 to build the memorial , but a dispute over its inscription and design issues put the project on ice .
differences were finally overcome early this year , enabling the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , to approve the monument commemorating the murder of at least 500,000 members of the two ethnic minorities in nazi extermination camps .
speaking at the inauguration ceremony , the minister in charge of culture said germany lived up to its historical obligations to those persecuted as " gypsies " under the nazis .

mr blagojevich was arrested last week and charged with attempting to " sell " barack obama 's vacant senate seat .
as governor of illinois , mr blagojevich has sole responsibility for picking mr obama 's successor in the senate .
mr blagojevich , who had not previously spoken in public about the charges against him , vowed to clear his name .
" i am not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing , " he told reporters .
" i intend to stay on the job - i will fight , i will fight , i will fight until i take my last breath . "
' pay to play ' schemes in a brief statement , he said he would fight the " false accusations " made by what he termed a " political lynch mob " .
charges against blagojevich federal agents say mr blagojevich tried to obtain campaign contributions in exchange for official actions tried to use state funds for the private purpose of inducing the tribune company to fire chicago tribune editorial board members critical of him tried to obtain personal financial benefits for himself in return for his appointment of a us senator profile : rod blagojevich and he expressed a desire to explain his actions in court .
" i 'm dying to answer these charges - i am dying to show you how innocent i am , " he said .
after quoting from the rudyard kipling poem " if " , mr blagojevich said : " there are some powerful forces arrayed against me .
it 's kind of lonely right now . "
" but i have on my side the most powerful ally there is , and it 's the truth . "
the bbc 's rajini vaidyanathan said the governor appeared to be using the news conference as an opportunity to speak directly to the people of illinois .
mr blagojevich and his lawyers seem to have come to the conclusion that the governor needs to win over illinois voters if he is to keep his job , our correspondent says .
' pay to play ' after the speech the lieutenant governor , pat quinn , pleaded with mr blagojevich to step aside under a constitutional provision that allows him to keep his title but give his duties to an acting governor - which , under the rules of succession , would be mr quinn . "
the governor is clearly impeded in his ability to carry-out his executive functions " lieutenant governor pat quinn " we heard his statement earlier : he feels that he will be vindicated , he said , in a court of law .
" our state can not wait while the chief executive battles in a court of law while we have so many major decisions that affect the welfare and safety of the people of illinois .
" the governor is clearly impeded in his ability to carry-out his executive functions . "
mr blagojevich was charged last week with a number of offences including soliciting a bribe .
the charges relate to a variety of corruption schemes in which the governor was allegedly involved , including so-called " pay to play " deals - the doling out of jobs , contracts and appointments in return for campaign contributions .
on the day of his arrest , investigators released transcripts of conversations between mr blagojevich and others intercepted by court-authorised wiretaps .
in the conversations , the democratic governor allegedly discussed offering mr obama 's senate seat in return for a well-paid position at a non-profit organisation or a group affiliated with trades unions , according to the affidavit .

it means walkers , cyclists and anglers can use the full 35 mile stretch of the monmouthshire and brecon canal .
eight people were rescued and the a4077 between crickhowell and gilwern was closed for a week after the 200-year-old canal breached on 16 october 2007 .
british waterways said the canal would be open to boat traffic by the spring .
a 16-mile stretch of the canal has been out of use since the canal burst its banks .
british waterways emptied the section between llanover and talybont to carry out the repair work , which officials said would cost £ 7.5m.
however two large sections either side of the affected area , in powys and monmouthshire , have remained open for visitors to enjoy .
mark durham from british waterways said the repair work was on schedule .
" much of the canal has now been re-watered , with just the breach site at gilwern to refill in the new year , " he said .
" in the meantime , with the coldest start to winter in 30 years and the festive season approaching , we would ask everyone to take extra care when they are out and about along our waterways . "

it called on the government to scrap april 's fuel duty rises , make christmas parking in towns and villages free and tackle longer-term transport problems .
the fsb says nearly 60 % of rural firms expect christmas trade to be down and 80 % say the government has not helped .
fsb chairman john wright said without support now , high streets could die .
" these figures show that small businesses in rural britain are the silent victims of the credit crunch , " he added .
" if rural firms are not supported now , we could watch our markets , high streets , towns and villages become extinct . "
a survey of almost 500 members of the trade body whose firms are based in rural areas also found confidence was low .
more than eight out of 10 small companies said they did not feel better placed to weather the economic troubles following november 's pre-budget report .
the fsb called for a package of measures for local firms , saying they provide a much-needed stimulus for towns and villages across britain .
they include tackling long-term rural problems such as the lack of transport infrastructure and poor access to services .
it also wants a commitment that a substantial amount of the £ 7bn made available by the government for small firms is used to help rural businesses .
