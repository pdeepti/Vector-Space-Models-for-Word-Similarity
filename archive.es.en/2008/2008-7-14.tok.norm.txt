the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .

that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important africa -pipe- 14.07.2008 european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for sudan 's president al-bashir europe 's leaders have called on sudan to respect the international criminal court 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir on genocide and war crimes charges . eu development commissioner louis michel called monday , july 14 , for an " end to the impunity " in darfur , after an international prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners . " as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .
everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .
" we would like the icc to suspend its decision to seek al-bashir 's arrest for a moment until we sort out the primary problems in darfur and southern sudan , " foreign affairs minister bernard membe told reuters , speaking on behalf of tanzanian president jakaya kikwete who chairs the au .
" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .
" if you arrest al-bashir , you will create a leadership vacuum in sudan .
the outcome could be equal to that of iraq .
there would be an increase in anarchy ; there would be an increase in civil war .
fighting between chad and sudan would increase , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany looks east to boost shrinking trainee numbers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough school leavers have the qualifications needed for a traineeship with too few qualified school-leavers applying to train as skilled workers in germany , companies and industry associations are wondering if it might be time to start hiring across the border . how the times have changed .
it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .
economy remains robust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is in good shape meanwhile , volker treier from the chambers of industry and commerce association -lrb- dihk -rrb- said monday , july 14 , that a drop in germany 's gross domestic product of some 0.5 percent was " as good as certain " in the second quarter of 2008 . he cited a reduced number of orders in the construction sector and industry as the main reason . however , he said he remained optimistic for the fiscal year .
" the economy is robust , " he told the mass-circulation newspaper bild .
" there are no grounds for concerns . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany charts new waters with offshore wind energy plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has yet to follow denmark 's zeal in erecting offshore wind farms germany has grand plans to build its first ever offshore wind farms in the north and baltic sea , a project that energy experts warn still has a long way to go in meeting formidable financial and technical challenges . buffeted by the soaring price of oil , a heated debate over a planned nuclear phase-out and pressure to meet its co2 emission targets , germany said last week it planned to give a massive boost to wind power in the coming years . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said berlin aims to build up to 30 offshore wind farms in the north sea and baltic sea , at a cost of 1 billion euros each , to reduce dependency on energy suppliers from overseas .
the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 14.07.2008 mega beer merger wo n't affect german market , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer has been brewed for centuries in germany belgium brewer inbev says it will buy us rival anheuser-busch for $ 52 billion to create the world 's largest brewer .
dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .

" france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court .

everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .

" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .

" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .
" we would like the icc to suspend its decision to seek al-bashir 's arrest for a moment until we sort out the primary problems in darfur and southern sudan , " foreign affairs minister bernard membe told reuters , speaking on behalf of tanzanian president jakaya kikwete who chairs the au .
" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .
" if you arrest al-bashir , you will create a leadership vacuum in sudan .
the outcome could be equal to that of iraq .
there would be an increase in anarchy ; there would be an increase in civil war .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .

there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .
israel accuses syria outright of supplying weapons to the militant shiite group hezbollah .
diplomatic relations re-established syria and lebanon announced saturday their decision to establish diplomatic relations , a first since their independence from colonial rule .
steg said syria 's declarations were grounds for hope that it was ready to end its " in part self-imposed isolation " .
" now the syrians must prove that they truly intend to play a responsible role to bring about peace and security in the middle east and that they want to work together constructively , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .
israel accuses syria outright of supplying weapons to the militant shiite group hezbollah .
diplomatic relations re-established syria and lebanon announced saturday their decision to establish diplomatic relations , a first since their independence from colonial rule .
steg said syria 's declarations were grounds for hope that it was ready to end its " in part self-imposed isolation " .
" now the syrians must prove that they truly intend to play a responsible role to bring about peace and security in the middle east and that they want to work together constructively , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany charts new waters with offshore wind energy plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has yet to follow denmark 's zeal in erecting offshore wind farms germany has grand plans to build its first ever offshore wind farms in the north and baltic sea , a project that energy experts warn still has a long way to go in meeting formidable financial and technical challenges . buffeted by the soaring price of oil , a heated debate over a planned nuclear phase-out and pressure to meet its co2 emission targets , germany said last week it planned to give a massive boost to wind power in the coming years . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said berlin aims to build up to 30 offshore wind farms in the north sea and baltic sea , at a cost of 1 billion euros each , to reduce dependency on energy suppliers from overseas .
the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .
israel accuses syria outright of supplying weapons to the militant shiite group hezbollah .
diplomatic relations re-established syria and lebanon announced saturday their decision to establish diplomatic relations , a first since their independence from colonial rule .
steg said syria 's declarations were grounds for hope that it was ready to end its " in part self-imposed isolation " .
" now the syrians must prove that they truly intend to play a responsible role to bring about peace and security in the middle east and that they want to work together constructively , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .

barth retaliated .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .

and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .

an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.07.2008 pkk : german hostages to be freed if turkey ends operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pkk has often used abductions to bring itself international attention turkey 's militant kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in germany , says three german hostages it is holding would only be released if berlin pressured ankara to end military operations against pkk fighters . rebels from the militant kurdish workers ' party , pkk , which is banned in germany , said three germans abducted in turkey last week were in good health but demanded that ankara halt military assaults in the area where they were seized . " the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important africa -pipe- 14.07.2008 european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for sudan 's president al-bashir europe 's leaders have called on sudan to respect the international criminal court 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir on genocide and war crimes charges . eu development commissioner louis michel called monday , july 14 , for an " end to the impunity " in darfur , after an international prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners . " as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .
everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .
" we would like the icc to suspend its decision to seek al-bashir 's arrest for a moment until we sort out the primary problems in darfur and southern sudan , " foreign affairs minister bernard membe told reuters , speaking on behalf of tanzanian president jakaya kikwete who chairs the au .
" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .
" if you arrest al-bashir , you will create a leadership vacuum in sudan .

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners . " as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .
everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 14.07.2008 mega beer merger wo n't affect german market , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer has been brewed for centuries in germany belgium brewer inbev says it will buy us rival anheuser-busch for $ 52 billion to create the world 's largest brewer .
dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany looks east to boost shrinking trainee numbers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough school leavers have the qualifications needed for a traineeship with too few qualified school-leavers applying to train as skilled workers in germany , companies and industry associations are wondering if it might be time to start hiring across the border . how the times have changed .
it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .

laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 14.07.2008 mega beer merger wo n't affect german market , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer has been brewed for centuries in germany belgium brewer inbev says it will buy us rival anheuser-busch for $ 52 billion to create the world 's largest brewer .
dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german brewers hoping for another summer fairy tale german breweries are hoping the euro 2008 will help boost falling beer sales and reverse shrinking profits .

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .
rescue services based in mountain huts were immediately alerted and tried in vain to reanimate two of the athletes .
the weather conditions hampered further rescue efforts , with only two of four helicopters deployed able to land on the mountain .
a total of 80 rescue services from the bavarian red cross and alpine rescue outposts came to the athletes ' aid , with a number of them suggesting it had been foolhardy not to cancel the race given the weather conditions .
according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .
although the organizers issued weather warnings , the event 's web site did not , apparently , intend the forecast to be seen as a deterrent .
" the conditions … .. mean that any contestant who reaches the finishing line is a winner , " it reportedly said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .

they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany looks east to boost shrinking trainee numbers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough school leavers have the qualifications needed for a traineeship with too few qualified school-leavers applying to train as skilled workers in germany , companies and industry associations are wondering if it might be time to start hiring across the border . how the times have changed .
it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .
economy remains robust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is in good shape meanwhile , volker treier from the chambers of industry and commerce association -lrb- dihk -rrb- said monday , july 14 , that a drop in germany 's gross domestic product of some 0.5 percent was " as good as certain " in the second quarter of 2008 . he cited a reduced number of orders in the construction sector and industry as the main reason . however , he said he remained optimistic for the fiscal year .
" the economy is robust , " he told the mass-circulation newspaper bild .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany charts new waters with offshore wind energy plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has yet to follow denmark 's zeal in erecting offshore wind farms germany has grand plans to build its first ever offshore wind farms in the north and baltic sea , a project that energy experts warn still has a long way to go in meeting formidable financial and technical challenges . buffeted by the soaring price of oil , a heated debate over a planned nuclear phase-out and pressure to meet its co2 emission targets , germany said last week it planned to give a massive boost to wind power in the coming years . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said berlin aims to build up to 30 offshore wind farms in the north sea and baltic sea , at a cost of 1 billion euros each , to reduce dependency on energy suppliers from overseas .
the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .

that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .
rescue services based in mountain huts were immediately alerted and tried in vain to reanimate two of the athletes .
the weather conditions hampered further rescue efforts , with only two of four helicopters deployed able to land on the mountain .
a total of 80 rescue services from the bavarian red cross and alpine rescue outposts came to the athletes ' aid , with a number of them suggesting it had been foolhardy not to cancel the race given the weather conditions .
according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .
although the organizers issued weather warnings , the event 's web site did not , apparently , intend the forecast to be seen as a deterrent .
" the conditions … .. mean that any contestant who reaches the finishing line is a winner , " it reportedly said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 14.07.2008 mega beer merger wo n't affect german market , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer has been brewed for centuries in germany belgium brewer inbev says it will buy us rival anheuser-busch for $ 52 billion to create the world 's largest brewer .
dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .
israel accuses syria outright of supplying weapons to the militant shiite group hezbollah .
diplomatic relations re-established syria and lebanon announced saturday their decision to establish diplomatic relations , a first since their independence from colonial rule .
steg said syria 's declarations were grounds for hope that it was ready to end its " in part self-imposed isolation " .

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .

an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important africa -pipe- 14.07.2008 european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for sudan 's president al-bashir europe 's leaders have called on sudan to respect the international criminal court 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir on genocide and war crimes charges . eu development commissioner louis michel called monday , july 14 , for an " end to the impunity " in darfur , after an international prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners . " as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .

according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 14.07.2008 mega beer merger wo n't affect german market , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer has been brewed for centuries in germany belgium brewer inbev says it will buy us rival anheuser-busch for $ 52 billion to create the world 's largest brewer .
dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important africa -pipe- 14.07.2008 european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for sudan 's president al-bashir europe 's leaders have called on sudan to respect the international criminal court 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir on genocide and war crimes charges . eu development commissioner louis michel called monday , july 14 , for an " end to the impunity " in darfur , after an international prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners . " as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .
everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .
" we would like the icc to suspend its decision to seek al-bashir 's arrest for a moment until we sort out the primary problems in darfur and southern sudan , " foreign affairs minister bernard membe told reuters , speaking on behalf of tanzanian president jakaya kikwete who chairs the au .
" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .
" if you arrest al-bashir , you will create a leadership vacuum in sudan .
the outcome could be equal to that of iraq .
there would be an increase in anarchy ; there would be an increase in civil war .
fighting between chad and sudan would increase , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.07.2008 pkk : german hostages to be freed if turkey ends operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pkk has often used abductions to bring itself international attention turkey 's militant kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in germany , says three german hostages it is holding would only be released if berlin pressured ankara to end military operations against pkk fighters . rebels from the militant kurdish workers ' party , pkk , which is banned in germany , said three germans abducted in turkey last week were in good health but demanded that ankara halt military assaults in the area where they were seized . " the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .
rescue services based in mountain huts were immediately alerted and tried in vain to reanimate two of the athletes .
the weather conditions hampered further rescue efforts , with only two of four helicopters deployed able to land on the mountain .
a total of 80 rescue services from the bavarian red cross and alpine rescue outposts came to the athletes ' aid , with a number of them suggesting it had been foolhardy not to cancel the race given the weather conditions .
according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .
although the organizers issued weather warnings , the event 's web site did not , apparently , intend the forecast to be seen as a deterrent .
" the conditions … .. mean that any contestant who reaches the finishing line is a winner , " it reportedly said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners . " as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .
everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .

" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .
" if you arrest al-bashir , you will create a leadership vacuum in sudan .
the outcome could be equal to that of iraq .

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .
rescue services based in mountain huts were immediately alerted and tried in vain to reanimate two of the athletes .
the weather conditions hampered further rescue efforts , with only two of four helicopters deployed able to land on the mountain .
a total of 80 rescue services from the bavarian red cross and alpine rescue outposts came to the athletes ' aid , with a number of them suggesting it had been foolhardy not to cancel the race given the weather conditions .
according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .
although the organizers issued weather warnings , the event 's web site did not , apparently , intend the forecast to be seen as a deterrent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany looks east to boost shrinking trainee numbers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough school leavers have the qualifications needed for a traineeship with too few qualified school-leavers applying to train as skilled workers in germany , companies and industry associations are wondering if it might be time to start hiring across the border . how the times have changed .
it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .

an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .
rescue services based in mountain huts were immediately alerted and tried in vain to reanimate two of the athletes .
the weather conditions hampered further rescue efforts , with only two of four helicopters deployed able to land on the mountain .
a total of 80 rescue services from the bavarian red cross and alpine rescue outposts came to the athletes ' aid , with a number of them suggesting it had been foolhardy not to cancel the race given the weather conditions .
according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .
although the organizers issued weather warnings , the event 's web site did not , apparently , intend the forecast to be seen as a deterrent .

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .

assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .
israel accuses syria outright of supplying weapons to the militant shiite group hezbollah .
diplomatic relations re-established syria and lebanon announced saturday their decision to establish diplomatic relations , a first since their independence from colonial rule .
steg said syria 's declarations were grounds for hope that it was ready to end its " in part self-imposed isolation " .
" now the syrians must prove that they truly intend to play a responsible role to bring about peace and security in the middle east and that they want to work together constructively , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .
israel accuses syria outright of supplying weapons to the militant shiite group hezbollah .
diplomatic relations re-established syria and lebanon announced saturday their decision to establish diplomatic relations , a first since their independence from colonial rule .
steg said syria 's declarations were grounds for hope that it was ready to end its " in part self-imposed isolation " .

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '

" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .

an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .

there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .

one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .
rescue services based in mountain huts were immediately alerted and tried in vain to reanimate two of the athletes .
the weather conditions hampered further rescue efforts , with only two of four helicopters deployed able to land on the mountain .
a total of 80 rescue services from the bavarian red cross and alpine rescue outposts came to the athletes ' aid , with a number of them suggesting it had been foolhardy not to cancel the race given the weather conditions .
according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .
although the organizers issued weather warnings , the event 's web site did not , apparently , intend the forecast to be seen as a deterrent .

it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .

and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.07.2008 pkk : german hostages to be freed if turkey ends operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pkk has often used abductions to bring itself international attention turkey 's militant kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in germany , says three german hostages it is holding would only be released if berlin pressured ankara to end military operations against pkk fighters . rebels from the militant kurdish workers ' party , pkk , which is banned in germany , said three germans abducted in turkey last week were in good health but demanded that ankara halt military assaults in the area where they were seized . " the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany looks east to boost shrinking trainee numbers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough school leavers have the qualifications needed for a traineeship with too few qualified school-leavers applying to train as skilled workers in germany , companies and industry associations are wondering if it might be time to start hiring across the border . how the times have changed .
it was n't long ago that a single trainee position would have been fought over by dozens of young applicants .
these days , however , the tables have turned .
companies are falling over one another in their efforts to recruit trainees - and they just ca n't find them .
the situation has become so difficult that various industry associations are calling on the government to free up the labor market for applicants from beyond germany 's borders .
this is already the case with academics , with the country set to open up next year to university graduates from the eastern european countries which joined the eu in its enlargement four years ago - including poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , estonia , lithuania and latvia .
but for unqualified workers , labor restrictions wo n't be falling until 2011 .
and for many companies , that 's a long time to wait .
an eastern problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is especially hard hit the trainee shortage is especially acute in germany 's eastern states .
hanns-eberhard schleyer , secretary general of the central association of german skilled workers , predicts that in these states , the number of applicants for trainee positions will have fallen 50 percent by 2011 - reflecting a marked drop in the number of qualified school-leavers in recent years .
this explains why so many companies are having problems meeting their skilled labor needs with young workers .
" our companies need new blood , they need skilled labor , " schleyer said .
" in germany it is becoming increasingly hard to find qualified young people to train . "
consequently , many companies are forced to fill vacant trainee positions with previous applicants who had been rejected due to inadequate qualifications .
the long-term result , he says , will be company closures .
before it comes to this , he proposes that the companies look abroad to countries such as poland the czech republic .
economy remains robust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is in good shape meanwhile , volker treier from the chambers of industry and commerce association -lrb- dihk -rrb- said monday , july 14 , that a drop in germany 's gross domestic product of some 0.5 percent was " as good as certain " in the second quarter of 2008 . he cited a reduced number of orders in the construction sector and industry as the main reason . however , he said he remained optimistic for the fiscal year .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .

laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 14.07.2008 germany charts new waters with offshore wind energy plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has yet to follow denmark 's zeal in erecting offshore wind farms germany has grand plans to build its first ever offshore wind farms in the north and baltic sea , a project that energy experts warn still has a long way to go in meeting formidable financial and technical challenges . buffeted by the soaring price of oil , a heated debate over a planned nuclear phase-out and pressure to meet its co2 emission targets , germany said last week it planned to give a massive boost to wind power in the coming years . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said berlin aims to build up to 30 offshore wind farms in the north sea and baltic sea , at a cost of 1 billion euros each , to reduce dependency on energy suppliers from overseas .
the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .
in another unexpected development marking a thaw in relations between the two countries that have long been strained , german chancellor angela merkel met syrian president bashar al-assad in paris at the launch of the union for the mediterranean on sunday .
assad comes out of the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's attendance at the club med talks was historic at the meeting of 43 heads of state and government from the european union and countries of the mediterranean littoral , assad agreed to establish formal diplomatic links with lebanon for the first time .
assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .
" that would also contribute to the security of lebanon . "
arms smuggling between lebanon and syria 's 170-kilometer -lrb- 105-mile -rrb- long border is believed to be rampant .
israel accuses syria outright of supplying weapons to the militant shiite group hezbollah .
diplomatic relations re-established syria and lebanon announced saturday their decision to establish diplomatic relations , a first since their independence from colonial rule .
steg said syria 's declarations were grounds for hope that it was ready to end its " in part self-imposed isolation " .
" now the syrians must prove that they truly intend to play a responsible role to bring about peace and security in the middle east and that they want to work together constructively , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important africa -pipe- 14.07.2008 european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for sudan 's president al-bashir europe 's leaders have called on sudan to respect the international criminal court 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir on genocide and war crimes charges . eu development commissioner louis michel called monday , july 14 , for an " end to the impunity " in darfur , after an international prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners . " as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .
everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .
" we would like the icc to suspend its decision to seek al-bashir 's arrest for a moment until we sort out the primary problems in darfur and southern sudan , " foreign affairs minister bernard membe told reuters , speaking on behalf of tanzanian president jakaya kikwete who chairs the au .
" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .
" if you arrest al-bashir , you will create a leadership vacuum in sudan .
the outcome could be equal to that of iraq .
there would be an increase in anarchy ; there would be an increase in civil war .
fighting between chad and sudan would increase , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .

the bavarian red cross reported that a number of them subsequently collapsed .
rescue services based in mountain huts were immediately alerted and tried in vain to reanimate two of the athletes .
the weather conditions hampered further rescue efforts , with only two of four helicopters deployed able to land on the mountain .
a total of 80 rescue services from the bavarian red cross and alpine rescue outposts came to the athletes ' aid , with a number of them suggesting it had been foolhardy not to cancel the race given the weather conditions .
according to police in the nearby town of weilheim , six participants were checked in to hospital in garmisch-partenkirchen , suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion .
the race takes place every year , with participants completing in just over 120 minutes a 16-kilometer course which would take normal mountain hikers up to nine hours .
although the organizers issued weather warnings , the event 's web site did not , apparently , intend the forecast to be seen as a deterrent .
" the conditions … .. mean that any contestant who reaches the finishing line is a winner , " it reportedly said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government hopes to obtain 25,000 megawatts of energy from offshore wind farms by 2030 , tiefensee said . charting unknown waters it ’ s a tall order considering not a single wind turbine is in place along germany ’ s coastline as yet , some experts say .
they point out that the minister ’ s ambitious plans are beset with questions about the technology . “ germany is the world leader in onshore wind technology but it ’ s still charting unknown waters with its offshore plans , ” said ulf gerard , spokesman for the german wind energy association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy currently makes up 7 percent of germany 's energy consumption with its estimated 19,500 onshore windmills producing 23,000 megawatts of energy , germany ’ s wind energy sector has seen exports boom in recent years as the demand for wind turbines rockets around the world .
last year , the industry created 8,000 new jobs in the country , increasing its total workforce to more than 80,000 . yet the country , famed for its green credentials , has held back from taking the plunge into offshore wind technology – increasingly accepted around the world as a renewable source of plentiful amounts of clean energy . experts have largely blamed a combination of spiraling costs for steel and copper , risk-averse investors and a still infant offshore technology for germany 's reluctance . incentives for investors but last month , the german parliament removed one of the biggest hurdles hampering the growth of offshore wind farms by amending the renewable energy act -lrb- eeg -rrb- to raise the so-called “ feed-in tariff ” for wind energy .
that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that ’ s the remuneration paid to owners of renewable energies systems when energy from their systems is delivered to the public electricity grid at sea - from a current 9 cents per kilowatt to 15 cents for wind energy . experts say the increased tariffs provide further incentives for investors to enter the world 's largest market in wind energy . “ investors in offshore wind farms can now be sure what level of income to expect until at least 2015 which is when the increased tariffs last until , ” said albrecht tiedemann , energy expert at the berlin-based german energy agency -lrb- dena -rrb- . as if on cue , business daily financial times deutschland reported last week that us private equity giant , blackstone plans to invest more than a billion euros in an offshore wind farm off the north sea . balancing act far out at sea while blackstone ’ s investment sent a cheer through germany ’ s wind industry , many say the biggest challenges lie in mastering a technology that is subject to a host of strict standards in germany . unlike existing offshore wind farms in denmark , the netherlands and britain which are sited a few kilometers from the shore , germany ’ s are to be located in deep water as far as 40 to 80 kilometers from the shoreline - a first in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's protected watt region is home to a unique and fragile ecosystem investors can acquire permits to build wind farms off the german coast only after rigorous environmental monitoring for more than a year to ensure their windmills do not disrupt fragile marine ecosystems , animal life and in particular the protected watt region on germany ’ s north sea coast .
the large distance to the coast is also meant to protect tourism by sparing sun-bathers on the islands of ruegen and helgoland the unsightly view of an army of wind turbines mushrooming out of the sea . “ it ’ s always a balancing act when you ’ re trying to reconcile fragile ecosystems with meeting energy needs , ” said andree buehling , energy expert at greenpeace .
he added that wind energy - which enjoys a clean image - would quickly fall out of favor with the population if it damaged the ecology . huge logistical and financial risks yet there ’ s no denying the stringent environmental standards make it more difficult to transport and install the bulky equipment needed for the wind farms . that includes massive five megawatt turbines , tested on land by some companies , that weigh more than a 100 tons each and are almost 200 meters tall . experts say the long distances , deep waters and a lack of sufficient electricity networks make the endeavor at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than on land .
laying underwater cables - one kilometer of cable is estimated to cost 1.5 million euros - anchoring the windmills in water that ’ s more than 25 meters deep , keeping the enormous turbines from corroding and carrying out maintenance work so far out at sea are considered huge logistical and financial challenges fraught with risks . since there are no existing models to draw lessons from , all eyes will be on germany 's first ever offshore wind farm being built off the island of borkum in the north sea .
three german energy giants , eon , ewe and vattenfall plan to install six turbines 45 kilometers away from the island ’ s shores this year , followed by another six next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : servicing such massive turbines far out in the sea wo n't be easy “ we have to remember that the new technology has only been tested on land so far , ” said tiedemann .
there may be a few surprises in store at sea , ” he said . one thing germany 's fledgling offshore wind energy industry will be keen to avoid is a repeat of " horns rev , " a wind farm installed by danish company vestas off the danish coast . in 2004 , all 80 wind turbines and their expensive components had to be completely swapped out with new ones because they began rusting - despite the fact that they were installed just three kilometers off the shore . for wind farms far out at sea , the consequences would be catastrophic . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .

" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important africa -pipe- 14.07.2008 european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for sudan 's president al-bashir europe 's leaders have called on sudan to respect the international criminal court 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir on genocide and war crimes charges . eu development commissioner louis michel called monday , july 14 , for an " end to the impunity " in darfur , after an international prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .
" the problem for international policymakers is that the prosecutor 's legal strategy also poses major risks for the fragile peace and security environment in sudan , with a real chance of greatly increasing the suffering of very large numbers of its people , " it said in a statement . un calls for cooperation and protection for troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops have been targeted by militia following the icc announcement , the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon said that the un respected the decision and called on the sudanese government to cooperate with the joint un-african union peacekeeping operation in sudan 's darfur region , which has been the target of attacks by armed militiamen allegedly with khartoum 's backing . " the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said . " the united nations peacekeeping operations in sudan will continue to conduct their important work in an impartial manner , cooperating in good faith with all partners so as to further the goal of peace and stability in the country , " the spokesperson said .
" the united nations will also continue its vital humanitarian and development work there . " sudan promises un , au soldiers are safe there are fears the arrest warrant could lead to attacks on un peacekeepers in darfur or the expulsion of western diplomats , but information minister al-zahawi malek said sudan would guarantee the safety of foreigners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.07.2008 berlin stand-up comic defies critics to set new world record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario barth has the audience eating out his hand madonna 's concert in the berlin olympic stadium in august is far from sold-out , but comedian mario barth had no such trouble filling the venue .
never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.07.2008 pkk : german hostages to be freed if turkey ends operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pkk has often used abductions to bring itself international attention turkey 's militant kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in germany , says three german hostages it is holding would only be released if berlin pressured ankara to end military operations against pkk fighters . rebels from the militant kurdish workers ' party , pkk , which is banned in germany , said three germans abducted in turkey last week were in good health but demanded that ankara halt military assaults in the area where they were seized . " the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 14.07.2008 mega beer merger wo n't affect german market , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer has been brewed for centuries in germany belgium brewer inbev says it will buy us rival anheuser-busch for $ 52 billion to create the world 's largest brewer .
dw-world.de spoke with a beer expert about the mega merger 's significance for the german market . inbev , the maker of stella artois and beck 's , has agreed to pay $ 70 -lrb- 44 euros -rrb- per share for anheuser-busch , the maker of budweiser and bud light beers , up from its original unsolicited bid of $ 65 per share , both companies said on monday , july 14 . the deal would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a us company . expected to be completed by the end of 2008 , it still has to be approved by shareholders and competition authorities . analysts say they aren ’ t expecting any problems . the combined company anheuser-bush inbev would have about $ 36.4 billion -lrb- 23 billion euros -rrb- in annual net sales , and would brew about a quarter of the world 's beer .
but the powerful fusion may not create much of a ripple in one of the world 's most important beer markets - germany . germans love their brew to be made close to home , and have little patience for foreign ales . in an interview with dw-world.de , marc-oliver huhnholz of the german brewers ’ union said despite the fact that inbev produces beck ’ s , one of germany ’ s most famous beers , the new merger is not expected to have a major impact on the german market . how do you think this will affect the brewing industry in germany ? you have to understand that the german brewery sector , or the german market , is very singular , and not comparable to other markets in the world .
it ’ s because of the german people who love their german beer .
so it ’ s very hard for a foreign company to get into the market , and we have seen that .
anheuser-busch tried some years ago to jump into the market , but wasn ’ t happy with this because the germans , as i mentioned before , love their german beer .
so there is no immediate impact on the german market because of the anheuser-busch or inbev corporation .
their might be indirect effects for inbev when it comes to buying hops or other stuff to brew beer , but we see no direct impact on the german market . inbev also owns beck ’ s , one of the most internationally recognized german beers . what do you think the odds are that other german breweries are going to be consumed by a large corporation like inbev ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's is the most famous german beer produced by inbev there are two sides to a takeover .
there is one company that wants to buy a german brewery and the other side that wants to sell their german company .
at the moment we see no other german brewery that wants to sell to another company from a foreign country .
so we see no tendency for developments like anheuser-busch and inbev have done now to become the world ’ s largest brewery .
i think german companies do not fear this large company any more than they fear the competition in the german market . beer has been brewed commercially in germany for over a thousand years .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria is the world ’ s oldest . does this long brewing tradition make it difficult for foreign brewers to break into the market ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brewers will have little to fear from the new multi-national conglomerate it ’ s tradition .
it ’ s part of the german culture .
the people adore their beer brewed in their neighborhood .
beer is regional .
it ’ s a regional product .
and the germans love their regionally brewed beer , and are not very open to beer brewed in foreign countries .
they want to know what is in their beer , and with beer brewed under the german purity law , which is now over 500 years old , they know exactly what is in their beer and they like the taste .
they do not like , for example , cherries in their beer , they do not like other components .
they only like the malt , the water and the hops in it , and that ’ s it .
i do not see that anheuser-busch and inbev will have a larger chance now by coming together to get into the german market . inbev , being a belgian-brazilian company , is subject to european union laws .
so does the german purity law help to keep them from becoming a huge player in the german beer market ? if you want to sell beer in germany , you ’ re allowed to , because the market has to be open for all products from europe .
but if you want to brew beer in german then you have to accept and use the purity law as a basis for the brewing of the beer . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .

" the secretary general emphasizes that the icc is an independent institution and that the united nations must respect the independence of the judicial process , " a un spokesperson said .

" as for those who are here in the different diplomatic organizations , we do n't think they are going to be under any pressure from the sudanese citizens .
everything will be secure , " the sudan tribune quoted him as saying sunday . but the joint african union-united nations peacekeeping mission in darfur , unamid , has raised its security alert level to four , meaning that all non-essential personnel are being relocated . unamid - which has less than 10,000 of the planned 26,000 military personnel in place - is already struggling to fulfill its peacekeeping role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are on alert for increased attacks by militia seven peacekeepers died last week following an attack believed to have been carried out by government-backed janjaweed militia and there are concerns within un circles that the militia could step up raids and that rebel groups could also be emboldened by the charges . " people are a little tense and there has been a lot of catastrophic thinking , " a source within the un in darfur told dpa news agency .
" over the coming days , it is possible the rebel forces , which have been gathering faster than expected , might do something . " however , a few hours after the charges were announced , there appeared to have been little reaction in darfur . " things have been calm .
the locals do not seem concerned , " the source said , adding that a lot of background diplomacy had been taking place to allow relief and peacekeeping missions to carry on as normal . much of the reaction is expected to come in khartoum , where on several thousand people rallied sunday in support of al-bashir . african union calls for suspension of warrant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au wants the icc to suspend its warrant for al-bashir however , the chair of the african union called for the decision to be suspended .
" we would like the icc to suspend its decision to seek al-bashir 's arrest for a moment until we sort out the primary problems in darfur and southern sudan , " foreign affairs minister bernard membe told reuters , speaking on behalf of tanzanian president jakaya kikwete who chairs the au .
" we are asking icc to re-examine its decision . " membe added that it was " not the right time " to seek bashir 's arrest .
" if you arrest al-bashir , you will create a leadership vacuum in sudan .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .

" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important africa -pipe- 14.07.2008 european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for sudan 's president al-bashir europe 's leaders have called on sudan to respect the international criminal court 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir on genocide and war crimes charges . eu development commissioner louis michel called monday , july 14 , for an " end to the impunity " in darfur , after an international prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for sudan 's president omar al-bashir .
sudan 's foreign ministry says it does not recognise the icc or its decisions . " it is important to bring an end to the impunity surrounding the crimes " committed in sudan 's darfur region , he told reporters , noting khartoum 's " flagrant " lack of cooperation with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- . his remarks came after icc prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo formally requested an arrest warrant for al-bashir for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in sudan 's conflict-torn darfur region . the icc will take at least several weeks to study the new evidence before deciding whether any warrants should be issued . if the judges agree to the request , it will mark the first time the icc has brought charges against a sitting head of state , although such leaders as slobodan milosevic of serbia and charles taylor of liberia were charged by other un-established war crimes tribunals while still in office . " the prosecutor has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe that omar hassan ahmad al-bashir bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , " moreno-ocampo 's statement said . " ... al-bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur , masalit and zaghawa groups , on account of their ethnicity .
his motives were largely political .
his alibi was a ' counterinsurgency . '
his intent was genocide , " the prosecutor said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreno-ocampo submitted evidence of the alleged crimes moreno-ocampo also said al-bashir " obstructs international assistance " and accused him of responsibility for killing and torturing the civilian population of darfur . he further stated that he had evidence that al-bashir " mobilized the entire state apparatus to subject the 2,450,000 people living in camps to conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction . " the eu ’ s michel said the move to issue an arrest warrant was " obviously a major development , which will clearly have a political impact . " france calls for sudan to respect international law separately , the european union 's french presidency said that the bloc " has taken note of the statements made by the prosecutor of the icc concerning the crimes committed in darfur . " " it is now up to the judges of the pre-trial chamber of the icc to determine what action they intend to take in response to the request issued by the prosecutor , " a statement said .
" the european union recalls that the icc plays a fundamental role in the promotion of international justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner says the icc decision must be respected french foreign minister bernard kouchner added that the sudanese president must respect the decision .
" it is a decision of the international criminal court and president bashir must respect it , " kouchner told reporters .
" he must take the court recommendations into account , period . " last month , eu foreign ministers warned that the bloc " stands ready to consider measures against individuals for not cooperating with the icc " if they flouted the un security council resolution that obliges them to do so . it came after moreno-ocampo called on the un security council to demand that sudan arrest two darfur war crimes suspects - ahmed haroun and ali kosheib . british prime minister gordon brown urged sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . speaking at his monthly press conference at his downing street office moments before the formal announcement , brown stressed that the icc had british support . brown said it was too early to comment specifically but added : " we call on the government of sudan to cooperate with the international criminal court . " the international criminal court has our support for its activities , ” brown said .
" we have raised with the sudanese government the need to cooperate with the international criminal court .
the foreign secretary raised this with the sudanese president on july 9 . " human rights groups welcome decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands are thought to have been killed human rights watch 's international justice program director richard dicker welcomed the icc move .
" charging president al-bashir for the hideous crimes in darfur shows that no one is above the law .
it is the prosecutor 's job to follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of official position , " he said in a statement . " the prosecutor 's filing confirms that the highest authority of the government has been personally involved in planning the mass campaign of violence against the population of darfur , " said souhayr belhassen , president of the international human rights federation -lrb- fidh -rrb- .
" we believe that disclosing this evidence and indicting beshir could contribute to stability in the region . " ilana soskin of the darfur emergency collective said she was confident the judges would decide to act against beshir , saying he was responsible for " ethnic cleansing " in darfur . the international crisis group , however , was more cautious .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .

there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .

one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .

" the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .
the syrian minister did not speak to the press and had no public engagements .

assad ended his international isolation by attending the summit , which included indirect talks through turkey between him and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
germany has long demanded that syria should recognize lebanon 's sovereignty and integrity and should cease interfering in domestic lebanese politics .
merkel 's spokesman , thomas steg , said monday the chancellor hoped that " deeds would soon follow words " and that formal ties between the two middle eastern neighbors would soon be established .
" we want to see actions now because enough words have been exchanged , " merkel reportedly told the press after her talks with assad in paris .
merkel calls for more action on arms smuggling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke to assad about the hizbollah situation steg said merkel had also called for an end to weapons smuggling across the border to the syrian-backed hezbollah movement .
steg said berlin and the international community were now waiting for syria to follow through on its pledge and to address other problems that had led to its pariah status .
" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .

" if syria aims to show its good will with this announcement then it could also follow up with good deeds and that would include , for example , a readiness to ensure that the alleged - at least never ruled-out - weapons smuggling over the land route to the hezbollah militias is stopped , " steg said .

the deal followed talks between chancellor merkel and president assad . the agreement provided a basis for sending back not only syrian nationals required to leave germany , but also nationals of other countries and stateless persons who had the right to be in syria , schaeuble said .
the new agreement was in line with modern european practice and would make a significant contribution to combating illegal migration from the middle east , he said .
a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry said that some 7,000 of the 28,350 syrian nationals currently in germany were obliged to leave the country .
abdelmajid 's visit to berlin was unexpectedly announced last week .

never before have so many people turned out for a stand-up comedy show . performing to an audience of 70,000 , barth 's show on saturday , july 12 , was more than four times larger than the previous world record-holder , a 15,900-person gig by us comedian chris rock in london , a guinness world records spokesman said .
to many , all it proves is that millions of people can be wrong .
he might be one of the most successful comedians in the country , but barth 's act is panned by the critics , who broadly agree that his jokes are about as subtle as whoopee cushion .
as his fan base has grown , so too has bemusement as too why such a basic brand of humor should be proving so popular .
primitive but happy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like you and me ?
like many a successful comedian , barth has found a routine and he 's sticking with it .
he first took his record-breaking show " men are primitive but happy " on the road in 2006 , peddling uninspired but time-honored gags about men who like beer and fast cars , and girlfriends who shop and chat constantly .
it 's since been seen by 1.6 million people .
his audiences tend to be composed mainly of 20-40-something couples , who , as the media has often reported , attend his performances instead of going to couples ' therapy .
" he really captures what relationships are like , " one fan told local radio station radio eins after saturday 's gig .
realizing he 's on to a good thing , barth has kept the jokes about women who ca n't park and always go to the bathroom in pairs coming thick and fast , delivering his stand-up with a studied berlin accent and punctuated by tireless references to flatulence .
to call it schoolboy humor would be to imbue it with more charm than many believe it has .
but while his detractors are passionate in their dislike of his unimaginative and clichéd quips , it seems that his fans are even more passionate in their devotion to a man they feel is just like they are .
the boy next door bildunterschrift : barth can do what madonna ca n't - fill the olympic stadium his man-of-the-people shtick is clearly key to his success .
born in berlin in 1972 , he grew up with five brothers in the working class neighborhoods of kreuzberg and neukoelln and trained at siemens as an electrician before heading to the canary islands as a package holiday host .
asked before saturday 's show if he was performing for anyone in particular , barth proved his solidarity with the common man .
" the people sitting at the back , " he said .
" they paid for their tickets , too . "
moreover , he 's a true local patriot .
but while most berliners like to carefully cultivate an image of sophisticated cool , barth goes for a salt-o ' -the-earth sales pitch , joking about how his girlfriend is always trying to take him to fancy restaurants .
perhaps achingly hip berlin is tired of having to be edgy all the time .
" he 's about as anarchic as a building loan contract , " complained one critic recently .
" what 's wrong with a building loan contract ? "
barth retaliated .
his audience would probably ask the same question . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 14.07.2008 pkk : german hostages to be freed if turkey ends operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pkk has often used abductions to bring itself international attention turkey 's militant kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in germany , says three german hostages it is holding would only be released if berlin pressured ankara to end military operations against pkk fighters . rebels from the militant kurdish workers ' party , pkk , which is banned in germany , said three germans abducted in turkey last week were in good health but demanded that ankara halt military assaults in the area where they were seized . " the pkk is ready to release the three german tourists on condition that turkey halts its military attacks in the area where they were captured , " pkk spokesman sozdar avesta told reporters in northern iraq 's qandil mountain range . the three germans were seized on tuesday in mount ararat area of turkey , believed to be the final resting place of the biblical noah 's ark .
the pkk claimed that the germans were working against the kurds in germany . " their arrest was a reaction to what germany is doing .
we urge the german government to undertake a new policy towards the kurds . " pkk strong as ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds in germany have protested against a possible major turkish cross-border operation into northern iraq the latest incident appears to show that the pkk is as strong as ever despite a week-long turkish offensive into northern iraq earlier this year aimed at destroying the pkk 's ability to use its mountainous hideouts to launch attacks inside turkey proper .
there are near daily reports of turkish soldiers being wounded or killed in firefights . the number of clashes , the hostage-taking and the rising incidence of soldiers being injured or killed by mines left by pkk rebels is nowhere near as high as in the early 1990s , when the conflict was its height . but it is a significant increase compared to the start of the century when turkey claimed its biggest success in its fight against the pkk : the capture in 1999 of separatist leader abdullah ocalan .
in a feat that captured the imagination of turkey , commandos arrested ocalan in the kenyan capital nairobi .
filmed with his capturers on a flight back to turkey , ocalan seemed a broken man .
he said he was ready to do anything for the turkish state and that he was a man of peace . at his trial for high treason ocalan said the pkk no longer wanted independence for south-east turkey but instead greater cultural rights and he called for a bilateral ceasefire . the pkk has since declared a number of unilateral ceasefires and fighting fell to extremely low levels in the early 2000s , low enough for emergency rule in the south-east to be lifted in 2002 .
at the time it appeared the turkish military had won its battle with the pkk and the separatists appeared to have lost its appetite for battle . terrorist acts on the rise again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish people have demonstrated all over germany against kurdish terrorism by 2003 , however , hardline elements within the pkk annoyed at turkey 's failure to make significant moves on the kurdish issue , restarted attacks . using bases in northern iraq , hundreds of pkk guerrillas crossed the iraq border into turkey .
one splinter group , the kurdish freedom falcons also carried out a number of bombings in western turkey resort towns . the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 gave hope to turkey that the pkk would be forced to close down its northern iraqi camps .
the difficulty in holding iraq together forced washington to abandon its promises to deal with the pkk forcing turkey to act on its own . in february , turkish troops backed by helicopter gunships and warplanes poured across the border .
in a short operation , the turkish military said it had killed more than 200 pkk separatists and destroyed a number of camps .
since then the air force has conducted a number of bombing raids on suspected pkk positions in northern iraq . that has n't stopped the attacks . on monday , july 14 , the anadolu news agency reported that two soldiers were killed in a armed clash with pkk guerrillas in the south-eastern province of sirnak , two more to add to the more than 32,000 killed since fighting began in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eads chief executive louis gallois talks to nigel cassidy about tankers , soaring oil prices and building planes in china .
eads , the company that owns airbus , expects to benefit from the high price of oil .
eads chief executive louis gallois told the bbc that the rising oil price is pushing airlines towards buying new , more efficient aeroplanes .
" we have the most energy-efficient aeroplane in the world , the a380 , the aeroplane of the future , " he said .
but he conceded that there is a danger that airlines in financial difficulties might delay or even cancel orders .
" we are not seeing that at high levels at the moment but we are very vigilant , " he said in an interview ahead of the farnborough international air show .
us tanker deal mr gallois was also asked about last thursday 's news that the us government has reopened a $ 35bn -lrb- £ 17bn -rrb- contract to supply the us air force with refuelling tankers .
the deal had been given to eads and its partner northrop grumman , beating a bid from boeing , but the us said mistakes had been made when the bids were evaluated .
" it 's not a potential loss - we want to win , " he said .
he said he was confident that his tanker would still win the contract and added that the experience would not prevent eads bidding for other contracts in the us .
" we have to be in the us - the us is the biggest market by far , " he said .

as the debate begins on whether the welsh assembly should gain full law-making powers , merthyr tydfil and rhymney am huw lewis outlines his hopes and concerns for the all wales convention . "
as a politically active student in scotland , i fondly remember the time i spent helping with the organisation of the convention there in the 1980s .
under the auspices of great political figures like john smith and donald dewar , the convention energised not just a debate on the future of scotland and devolution : it got people from all walks of life talking enthusiastically about politics and their vision of what they wanted their society to look like .
it was an exciting time , and it left an indelible mark on all those involved .
anyone involved or interested in politics in wales must hope that the same levels of interest and enthusiasm are developed by the 16 members of our convention .
a quick look at the falling turnouts in successive elections is all that is required to show how people in wales , once the most political of nations , are falling out of love with organised politics .
there are a number of reasons for this - touched on recently by peter hain , for example , when he described the demise of traditional clubs , societies and large workplaces .
so whilst people may argue about how far the convention should go in terms of actually drumming up support for further devolution , there should be one crucial aspect we should all be able agree on .
through explaining the current system - and by discussing the assembly 's function and how it can shape society in wales - this is an unprecedented opportunity to reconnect people with politics .
the idea of a " convention " is something i have long advocated inside the labour movement in wales - the practice is commonly used on the continent , aside from set-piece annual conferences , to take a longer-term look about a party 's vision and general direction of travel over 10 years , or even a generation .
clearly the all wales convention will not be political with a capital p , but it does have that same opportunity to encourage a debate about the long-term future of welsh governance .
' popular support ' there are those inside and outside the labour party in wales who question the need for such a convention at this moment in time .
as someone who is currently engaged in a backbench bid to devolve more powers to the assembly -lrb- on buses and coaches -rrb- using the new government of wales act , i have some sympathy with that opinion .
we are after all talking about changing the welsh devolution settlement before we 've really tested the new powers won through the 2006 act .
to some , that seems an unseemly way of doing things , and without a case in point where we can say ' we need extra powers because currently we ca n't make welsh society better by doing x , y or z ' it is reasonable to ask if we are putting the cart before the horse .
i 've always been pro-devolution because of the opportunities it affords people to make society-changing decisions closer to the grassroots .
the best outcome of the convention will therefore have to involve some real examples of why further powers are needed to make wales a better place to live and do business - only then will popular support be assured in any future referendum . "

the idea of a " convention " is something i have long advocated inside the labour movement in wales - the practice is commonly used on the continent , aside from set-piece annual conferences , to take a longer-term look about a party 's vision and general direction of travel over 10 years , or even a generation .

huw lewis says it is fair to ask if the cart is being put before the horse as the debate begins on whether the welsh assembly should gain full law-making powers , merthyr tydfil and rhymney am huw lewis outlines his hopes and concerns for the all wales convention .
as a politically active student in scotland , i fondly remember the time i spent helping with the organisation of the convention there in the 1980s .
under the auspices of great political figures like john smith and donald dewar , the convention energised not just a debate on the future of scotland and devolution : it got people from all walks of life talking enthusiastically about politics and their vision of what they wanted their society to look like .
it was an exciting time , and it left an indelible mark on all those involved .
anyone involved or interested in politics in wales must hope that the same levels of interest and enthusiasm are developed by the 16 members of our convention .
a quick look at the falling turnouts in successive elections is all that is required to show how people in wales , once the most political of nations , are falling out of love with organised politics .
there are a number of reasons for this - touched on recently by peter hain , for example , when he described the demise of traditional clubs , societies and large workplaces .

the $ 52bn -lrb- £ 26bn -rrb- takeover bid by inbev , which makes stella artois beer , was accepted by anheuser 's board .
the combined company will now be called anheuser-busch inbev .
anheuser makes budweiser - the most popular beer in the us - and some us politicians had expressed anger at the prospect of a foreign takeover .
' unrivalled brands ' in a concession to political concerns about the deal , budweiser 's headquarters will remain in st louis , missouri while none of anheuser 's us breweries will be closed .
combined brand menu stella , budweiser , beck 's , hoegaarden , leffe , brahma , staropramen , michelob , rolling rock brazilian background to mega-deal inbev is offering to pay $ 70 a share for anheuser in a deal which must be approved by shareholders of both businesses .
the combined business will have annual sales of $ 36.4bn , equivalent to 46 billion litres of beer a year .
it will bring a host of popular brands including beck 's , hoegaarden and staropramen - in addition to budweiser and stella - under one roof .
inbev , itself formed by a giant merger of brazil 's ambev and belgium 's interbrew several years ago , described the deal as " historic " .
" together , anheuser-busch and inbev will be able to accomplish much more than each can on its own , " said inbev 's brazilian boss carlos brito , who will become chief executive of the new firm .
" this combination will create a stronger , more competitive global company with an unrivalled worldwide brand portfolio and distribution network , with great potential for growth all over the world . "
anheuser boss august busch said the transaction would " enhance global market access for budweiser , one of america 's truly iconic brands " .
job concerns there are widespread fears that the deal will lead to substantial job losses in the us midwest at a time while the threat of recession is hanging over the economy .
the two firms have said the deal will generate annual savings of $ 1.5bn but have suggested that job losses will be kept to a minimum because there is little current overlap between the two businesses .
anheuser - which employs 6,000 staff - currently controls nearly half of the us market , while inbev is strong in western european and latin american markets .
anheuser also owns stakes in mexican brewer grupo modelo and chinese brewer tsingtao .
the deal should give budweiser a platform to boost its growth in europe where , apart from a number of markets like the uk , it has been relatively weak .
analysts broadly welcomed the deal .
" the synergies are better than expected , $ 70 is a reasonable price and inbev has avoided a long , drawn-out battle in the courts , " said wim hoste , from kbc securities .
the beer market has been rapidly consolidating in the face of cost pressures and declining sales in many mature markets .
scottish & newcastle , the uk 's largest brewer , was recently bought out by heineken and carlsberg .

the $ 52bn -lrb- £ 26bn -rrb- takeover bid by inbev , which makes stella artois beer , was accepted by anheuser 's board .

the combined business will have annual sales of $ 36.4bn , equivalent to 46 billion litres of beer a year .
it will bring a host of popular brands including beck 's , hoegaarden and staropramen - in addition to budweiser and stella - under one roof .
inbev , itself formed by a giant merger of brazil 's ambev and belgium 's interbrew several years ago , described the deal as " historic " .
" together , anheuser-busch and inbev will be able to accomplish much more than each can on its own , " said inbev 's brazilian boss carlos brito , who will become chief executive of the new firm .
" this combination will create a stronger , more competitive global company with an unrivalled worldwide brand portfolio and distribution network , with great potential for growth all over the world . "
anheuser boss august busch said the transaction would " enhance global market access for budweiser , one of america 's truly iconic brands " .
job concerns there are widespread fears that the deal will lead to substantial job losses in the us midwest at a time while the threat of recession is hanging over the economy .
the two firms have said the deal will generate annual savings of $ 1.5bn but have suggested that job losses will be kept to a minimum because there is little current overlap between the two businesses .

with 35 countries represented , farnborough international , with its associated cocktail parties and vip dinners , has also emerged as one of the industry 's most important networking events .
two years ago , when the show was last held here at farnborough - it alternates with paris - orders totalling some $ 42bn were announced , and billions of dollars worth of deals will be announced this year too - even though the industry is suffering its worst downturn since the 9/11 attacks in new york in 2001 .
but more importantly the ground is being laid for the deals of the future .
sales people and hardware engineers mingle with purchasing managers and procurement officers , amid the 1,500 exhibits that fill up the large halls .
analysts and journalist quiz executives over drinks in air-conditioned chalets and lavish pavilions .
while outside , on the airfield , menacing fighter jets and heavily armed helicopters are lined up alongside large airbus and boeing passenger planes and a scattering of smaller executive jets in a united display of might , fire-power and market forces .
fuel , fuel , fuel but this united front - this confident , imposing display of hardware - belies a growing threat that is striking fear into an industry well versed in the art of batting back challenging strikes , be they tight defence budgets , corruption scandals or global trade wars .
the way it goes is there will be higher fares and then lower traffic .
the immediate effect of this is lower orders nick cunningham , evolution securities the aerospace and defence sector has been caught on the back foot by the surge in global oil prices - from less than $ 100 at the start of this year to more than $ 140 a barrel at its peak , and still climbing according to most forecasters .
hence , this year the airshow will be dominated by three issues , according to accenture 's aerospace and defence partner michael hackerson : " it 's going to be fuel , fuel and fuel . "
with aviation fuel prices rocketing , everyone - from airlines and air forces to manufacturers and their suppliers - is forced to respond fast .
" we 've only seen the start of that so far with the fuel surcharges that have gone on , " says evolution securities ' commercial aviation analyst nick cunningham .
" the way it goes is there will be higher fares and then lower traffic .
the immediate effect of this is lower orders . "
on show at farnborough 2008 in pictures airlines are ditching unprofitable routes as their executives begin to ask what they must keep on doing and what they can afford to shed .
aircraft are parked while old planes are retired more quickly than in the past .
at least two dozen airlines have collapsed so far this year as the industry has clocked up $ 2.3bn in losses .
so the stream of new orders has slowed dramatically .
last year in paris , some 600 aircraft were sold .
this year some analysts say they expect less than half the number of sales to be announced , in spite of large orders expected from the middle eastern airlines qatar and etihad .
" in terms of orders , farnborough is likely to be much more low-key , " says morgan stanley analyst rupinder vig .
agrees mr cunningham : " everybody 's too nervous to order airplanes , and also rather concerned that they ordered too many last year and the year before . "
others are eager to stress that it could be worse .
" there is a vague feeling that we are going straight off the edge of a waterfall , but i do n't think it is that bad , " observes teal group aerospace consultant richard aboulafia .
fuel accelerator air chief marshals and their procurement officers , meanwhile , feel the soaring and unpredictable fuel costs could hint at potential fuel scarcity .
they see this as a strategic threat , as well as a financial risk that adds volatility and uncertainty at a time when defence purse strings are being tightened .
the process has brought added momentum to the search for composite material that helps reduce the weight of aircraft , for more efficient and thus less polluting engines , and for alternative energy sources .
" the only way out is to ensure aircraft are more fuel efficient , " insists bgc partners strategist howard wheeldon .
certain future what matters to end users - the airlines and the air forces - is the total cost of ownership , and this has been rising year by year in an unpredictable manner .
firms are also grappling with tighter defence budgets so they are finding themselves in a tricky situation , not least when seen in the context of rising fuel costs and tighter defence and airline budgets .
in short ; the military chiefs and airline executives no longer want to buy aircraft , which they then have to service and repair themselves .
they want to pay for package deals , similar to leasing agreements , only much more complex .
" it 's a fundamental change for the industry , " says mr hackerson .
" this goes through the entire supply chain . "
essentially , it changes the economics of the industry ; in the past , manufacturers and parts suppliers would benefit when an engine needed servicing , repairing or replacing - as the customer would pay the garage bill , so to speak .
in the future , the customer pays a fixed fee per month or year , expecting their aircraft to work efficiently in return .
the risk of ownership is being transferred away from them , back to the people who made the aircraft in the first place .
for the plane makers , breakages that used to make them money will now instead cost them , so they will be looking for ways to make aircraft work in more efficient ways .
parts will be monitored more closely .
they will be serviced to extend their working lives .
they will be replaced before they break .
new deals on the ground at farnborough , the deal makers are responding .
major manufacturers are sniffing around for partners prepared to share the risk of building new aircraft , whether parts suppliers or firms pitching for outsourcing contracts .
aerospace firms expect fewer aircraft orders this year and the nature of the deals is rapidly changing , with sales people increasingly selling services rather than hardware .
" the whole trend is accelerated by fuel prices , " says mr hackerson .
yet at the show , expect the machines to remain in the limelight .
the lockheed martin f-22 fighter jet will wow the audience for the first time , and giants such as the airbus a380 and the eurofighter typhoon will return to remind the industry that however tough the situation might seem for them right now , the remaining desire for personal travel and national defence will undoubtedly keep the orders ticking in for years to come .
" we see a bigger demand for replacing older , less efficient aircraft , " says boeing marketing executive randy tinseth , while rival airbus is being asked to speed up production to replace old aircraft that consume too much kerosene , according to director-general fabrice bregier .
so over time , the soaring energy prices may even play to the manufacturers ' advantage .

fuel accelerator air chief marshals and their procurement officers , meanwhile , feel the soaring and unpredictable fuel costs could hint at potential fuel scarcity .
they see this as a strategic threat , as well as a financial risk that adds volatility and uncertainty at a time when defence purse strings are being tightened .
the process has brought added momentum to the search for composite material that helps reduce the weight of aircraft , for more efficient and thus less polluting engines , and for alternative energy sources .
" the only way out is to ensure aircraft are more fuel efficient , " insists bgc partners strategist howard wheeldon .
certain future what matters to end users - the airlines and the air forces - is the total cost of ownership , and this has been rising year by year in an unpredictable manner .
firms are also grappling with tighter defence budgets so they are finding themselves in a tricky situation , not least when seen in the context of rising fuel costs and tighter defence and airline budgets .
in short ; the military chiefs and airline executives no longer want to buy aircraft , which they then have to service and repair themselves .
they want to pay for package deals , similar to leasing agreements , only much more complex .
" it 's a fundamental change for the industry , " says mr hackerson .
" this goes through the entire supply chain . "
essentially , it changes the economics of the industry ; in the past , manufacturers and parts suppliers would benefit when an engine needed servicing , repairing or replacing - as the customer would pay the garage bill , so to speak .
in the future , the customer pays a fixed fee per month or year , expecting their aircraft to work efficiently in return .
the risk of ownership is being transferred away from them , back to the people who made the aircraft in the first place .
for the plane makers , breakages that used to make them money will now instead cost them , so they will be looking for ways to make aircraft work in more efficient ways .
parts will be monitored more closely .
they will be serviced to extend their working lives .
they will be replaced before they break .
new deals on the ground at farnborough , the deal makers are responding .
major manufacturers are sniffing around for partners prepared to share the risk of building new aircraft , whether parts suppliers or firms pitching for outsourcing contracts .
aerospace firms expect fewer aircraft orders this year and the nature of the deals is rapidly changing , with sales people increasingly selling services rather than hardware .
" the whole trend is accelerated by fuel prices , " says mr hackerson .
yet at the show , expect the machines to remain in the limelight .
the lockheed martin f-22 fighter jet will wow the audience for the first time , and giants such as the airbus a380 and the eurofighter typhoon will return to remind the industry that however tough the situation might seem for them right now , the remaining desire for personal travel and national defence will undoubtedly keep the orders ticking in for years to come .
" we see a bigger demand for replacing older , less efficient aircraft , " says boeing marketing executive randy tinseth , while rival airbus is being asked to speed up production to replace old aircraft that consume too much kerosene , according to director-general fabrice bregier .
so over time , the soaring energy prices may even play to the manufacturers ' advantage .

with 35 countries represented , farnborough international , with its associated cocktail parties and vip dinners , has also emerged as one of the industry 's most important networking events .
two years ago , when the show was last held here at farnborough - it alternates with paris - orders totalling some $ 42bn were announced , and billions of dollars worth of deals will be announced this year too - even though the industry is suffering its worst downturn since the 9/11 attacks in new york in 2001 .
but more importantly the ground is being laid for the deals of the future .
sales people and hardware engineers mingle with purchasing managers and procurement officers , amid the 1,500 exhibits that fill up the large halls .
analysts and journalist quiz executives over drinks in air-conditioned chalets and lavish pavilions .
while outside , on the airfield , menacing fighter jets and heavily armed helicopters are lined up alongside large airbus and boeing passenger planes and a scattering of smaller executive jets in a united display of might , fire-power and market forces .
fuel , fuel , fuel but this united front - this confident , imposing display of hardware - belies a growing threat that is striking fear into an industry well versed in the art of batting back challenging strikes , be they tight defence budgets , corruption scandals or global trade wars .
the way it goes is there will be higher fares and then lower traffic .
the immediate effect of this is lower orders nick cunningham , evolution securities the aerospace and defence sector has been caught on the back foot by the surge in global oil prices - from less than $ 100 at the start of this year to more than $ 140 a barrel at its peak , and still climbing according to most forecasters .
hence , this year the airshow will be dominated by three issues , according to accenture 's aerospace and defence partner michael hackerson : " it 's going to be fuel , fuel and fuel . "
with aviation fuel prices rocketing , everyone - from airlines and air forces to manufacturers and their suppliers - is forced to respond fast .
" we 've only seen the start of that so far with the fuel surcharges that have gone on , " says evolution securities ' commercial aviation analyst nick cunningham .
" the way it goes is there will be higher fares and then lower traffic .
the immediate effect of this is lower orders . "
on show at farnborough 2008 in pictures airlines are ditching unprofitable routes as their executives begin to ask what they must keep on doing and what they can afford to shed .
aircraft are parked while old planes are retired more quickly than in the past .
at least two dozen airlines have collapsed so far this year as the industry has clocked up $ 2.3bn in losses .
so the stream of new orders has slowed dramatically .
last year in paris , some 600 aircraft were sold .
this year some analysts say they expect less than half the number of sales to be announced , in spite of large orders expected from the middle eastern airlines qatar and etihad .
" in terms of orders , farnborough is likely to be much more low-key , " says morgan stanley analyst rupinder vig .
agrees mr cunningham : " everybody 's too nervous to order airplanes , and also rather concerned that they ordered too many last year and the year before . "

microsoft and sony are both expected to follow the nintendo wii 's lead and push into social gaming .
observers say the recent cut for the xbox 360 is microsoft 's bid to make the console more appealing .
" there is a strong move to pull in women , young girls and older people , " said analyst piers harding-rolls .

publishers and developers are beginning to exploit new forms of content , new types of gaming , as well as delivery through online sales , said mr harding-rolls .
marketing campaign microsoft is expected to unveil a massive marketing campaign aimed at repositioning the xbox 360 .
one of the first elements of that is to cut the price of the 20gb xbox 360 in north american to $ 299 -lrb- £ 150 -rrb- - closer to the price of the wii .
additionally , in august a 60gb xbox will debut that will cost $ 349 -lrb- £ 175 -rrb- .

lifestyle peripherals " i think that you 'll have some exciting lifestyle peripherals on the playstation portable alongside the playstation 3 , " predicted games consultant nick parker .
littlebigplanet is one of sony 's big games nintendo is expected to announce a number of deals with third-party developers , who are hoping to capitalise on the success of the wii , as well as lift the lid of what its own internal studios are currently working on .
" wii is dominated by nintendo 's own software .
can third parties make substantial returns on the wii ? " asked mr harding-rolls .
he added : " behind closed doors nintendo will be looking to reassure publishers about the potential of the platform and its longevity . "
one of the other key themes of e3 will be the continued growth in online content , he predicted .
he said : " we 'll see more downloadable titles .
it will be interesting to see if there any more premium titles delivered via digital distribution .
" online gaming is becoming increasingly popular across the whole of europe .
europe is not a small online gaming market anymore . "
the success of games based around peripherals , such as rock band , guitar hero and singstar , is also likely to spur more developers to create add-on friendly titles , especially as their increased sales prices boost revenues .

difficult and expensive launch periods have been completed , developers have got to grips with the demands of new hardware and a growing market of gamers is hungry for new content .
but what lies ahead for sony , microsoft and nintendo ?
microsoft xbox 360 eight years after bill gates first announced plans for a microsoft games console , called the xbox , the company has yet to lead the market significantly in any territory .
factfile : xbox 360 and for all the billions of dollars invested in xbox the company has yet to see any financial return .
so has the xbox project being a failure ?
analyst nick parker , who has worked for all the console firms , said : " one could look at the maths and say yes , from a business point of view you would not have made the same moves seven years ago .
" but in terms of what they have achieved they have certainly built up the best online gaming console for the masses . "
he added : " it has n't been an easy ride for them ; they made some early mistakes with the brand and the product itself . "
the ugly black box of the original xbox , its oversized controllers and noisy fan turned many gamers off .
" there is a lot of negative heritage from the previous model , " said mr parker .
determined to get to market early , the xbox 360 was the first of the current generation devices to reach eager gamers .
piers harding-rolls , an analyst with screen digest , said : " they had a head of steam built but did n't deliver on it .
" despite their early launch and success of xbox they did n't build up a successful brand on continental europe . "
the xbox 360 has become synonymous with hard-core gaming , fuelled by the success of action titles such as gears of war and the halo franchise , and across continental europe it is an image which turns many gamers off .
mr parker said : " their issues are still with the brand in europe .
they are fighting a very robust legacy brand in playstation . "
but microsoft is preparing a major re-branding exercise to overturn many consumers ' preconceptions about the console .
" europe is the true competitive front ; they see it as the tipping point , " said mr harding-rolls .
he added : " they realise now that the european market is not the us market . "
an industry insider told bbc news that microsoft had a " considerable war chest " to invest in re-positioning the image of the xbox 360 to mainland europe .
and software titles that appeal to a wider demographic will be a large part of that strategy .
at e3 microsoft is expect to place a large amount of emphasis on family and social games , through software and peripherals .
in many ways microsoft is attempting to wrestle away some of the success nintendo has had with its wii console .
but the job of re-inventing the xbox 360 for a whole new market of gamers was " a big gamble " , said mr parker .
" but , " he added , " they have got to do it . "
nintendo wii " no-one predicted how successful the wii was going to be , " said mr harding-rolls .
factfile : wii after failing to deliver the success it had hoped for with the gamecube , nintendo surprised many by taking a completely different route with its follow-up , the wii .
" nintendo was really astute to recognise the potential of social gaming and to see its popularity on platforms like the pc , translate it to the console space and have it on primary screens in the living room , " explained mr harding-rolls .
sony may have helped to pioneer social gaming on playstation 2 with singstar and eyetoy , but nintendo took the genre on and turned it into a global phenomenon .
" it 's almost a parallel games market , " said mr parker .
" there 's been a lot of talk recently about whether what they do is games or lifestyle assistants , " he added .
but that success has brought its own challenges .
" there are still question marks over its longevity , " said mr harding-rolls .
" of those people who go out and buy hardware and wii fit , how many will buy follow-up software ? "
but he added : " but it 's not a fad .
it 's a legitimate product with legitimate customer base . "
there are also question marks about some developers ' commitment to the platform long term .
" they are not investing huge amounts of cash into the market and letting nintendo alone drive hardware sales , " said mr parker .
developer david braben , whose firm frontier produced lost winds for the wii , said the console was a key part of its plans .
he said : " there has been quite a lot of differentiation between the consoles , which has n't happened before with console generations .
" the type of people who buy wii contrast with those who buy the other consoles .
that lets us develop something new and fresh for the console , instead of just another sequel . "
sony playstation 3 delays , resentment over its high price , confusion over differing models and features around the world ; the birth of playstation 3 was anything but smooth .
factfile : playstation 3 but all the signs point to sony steering the playstation 3 into smoother waters .
mr parker said : " they are pretty much on track .
analysts and journalists were expecting too much too quickly on playstation 3 .
" it was always going to take a long time .
but they are very loyal to playstation in europe and now that the big games are hitting the shops people are buying the machine . "
mr harding-rolls added : " to analysts , sony 's launch figures were very good . "
for sony , the next 12 months is about maintaining its momentum and trying to differentiate the ps3 from its direct rival , the xbox 360 .
at e3 the company is tipped to push connectivity between the playstation portable and the ps3 , as well as growing the use of user-generated content in gaming through the use of peripherals like eyetoy .
the company 's plans for the device as a multimedia hub are also expected to take shape at e3 , with reports of a movie download store and confirmation dates for the launch of peripherals like play tv and its virtual world , home , expected .
long-awaited games such as killzone 2 and littlebigplanet are now on the near horizon and sony will be keen to flex its first-party development muscles .
mr harding-rolls said : " their key differentiator from rivals is their internal development capability .
the potential is there but they have n't fully delivered .
" nintendo may be more prolific but they do n't have as many staff as sony . "

and software titles that appeal to a wider demographic will be a large part of that strategy .
at e3 microsoft is expect to place a large amount of emphasis on family and social games , through software and peripherals .
in many ways microsoft is attempting to wrestle away some of the success nintendo has had with its wii console .
but the job of re-inventing the xbox 360 for a whole new market of gamers was " a big gamble " , said mr parker .

nintendo wii " no-one predicted how successful the wii was going to be , " said mr harding-rolls .
factfile : wii after failing to deliver the success it had hoped for with the gamecube , nintendo surprised many by taking a completely different route with its follow-up , the wii .
" nintendo was really astute to recognise the potential of social gaming and to see its popularity on platforms like the pc , translate it to the console space and have it on primary screens in the living room , " explained mr harding-rolls .
sony may have helped to pioneer social gaming on playstation 2 with singstar and eyetoy , but nintendo took the genre on and turned it into a global phenomenon .
" it 's almost a parallel games market , " said mr parker .
" there 's been a lot of talk recently about whether what they do is games or lifestyle assistants , " he added .

" there are still question marks over its longevity , " said mr harding-rolls .
" of those people who go out and buy hardware and wii fit , how many will buy follow-up software ? "
but he added : " but it 's not a fad .
it 's a legitimate product with legitimate customer base . "
there are also question marks about some developers ' commitment to the platform long term .
" they are not investing huge amounts of cash into the market and letting nintendo alone drive hardware sales , " said mr parker .
developer david braben , whose firm frontier produced lost winds for the wii , said the console was a key part of its plans .
he said : " there has been quite a lot of differentiation between the consoles , which has n't happened before with console generations .
" the type of people who buy wii contrast with those who buy the other consoles .
that lets us develop something new and fresh for the console , instead of just another sequel . "
sony playstation 3 delays , resentment over its high price , confusion over differing models and features around the world ; the birth of playstation 3 was anything but smooth .
factfile : playstation 3 but all the signs point to sony steering the playstation 3 into smoother waters .
mr parker said : " they are pretty much on track .
analysts and journalists were expecting too much too quickly on playstation 3 .
" it was always going to take a long time .
but they are very loyal to playstation in europe and now that the big games are hitting the shops people are buying the machine . "
mr harding-rolls added : " to analysts , sony 's launch figures were very good . "
for sony , the next 12 months is about maintaining its momentum and trying to differentiate the ps3 from its direct rival , the xbox 360 .
at e3 the company is tipped to push connectivity between the playstation portable and the ps3 , as well as growing the use of user-generated content in gaming through the use of peripherals like eyetoy .
the company 's plans for the device as a multimedia hub are also expected to take shape at e3 , with reports of a movie download store and confirmation dates for the launch of peripherals like play tv and its virtual world , home , expected .
long-awaited games such as killzone 2 and littlebigplanet are now on the near horizon and sony will be keen to flex its first-party development muscles .
mr harding-rolls said : " their key differentiator from rivals is their internal development capability .

difficult and expensive launch periods have been completed , developers have got to grips with the demands of new hardware and a growing market of gamers is hungry for new content .
but what lies ahead for sony , microsoft and nintendo ?
microsoft xbox 360 eight years after bill gates first announced plans for a microsoft games console , called the xbox , the company has yet to lead the market significantly in any territory .
factfile : xbox 360 and for all the billions of dollars invested in xbox the company has yet to see any financial return .
so has the xbox project being a failure ?
analyst nick parker , who has worked for all the console firms , said : " one could look at the maths and say yes , from a business point of view you would not have made the same moves seven years ago .
" but in terms of what they have achieved they have certainly built up the best online gaming console for the masses . "
he added : " it has n't been an easy ride for them ; they made some early mistakes with the brand and the product itself . "
the ugly black box of the original xbox , its oversized controllers and noisy fan turned many gamers off .
" there is a lot of negative heritage from the previous model , " said mr parker .
determined to get to market early , the xbox 360 was the first of the current generation devices to reach eager gamers .
piers harding-rolls , an analyst with screen digest , said : " they had a head of steam built but did n't deliver on it .
" despite their early launch and success of xbox they did n't build up a successful brand on continental europe . "
the xbox 360 has become synonymous with hard-core gaming , fuelled by the success of action titles such as gears of war and the halo franchise , and across continental europe it is an image which turns many gamers off .
mr parker said : " their issues are still with the brand in europe .
they are fighting a very robust legacy brand in playstation . "
but microsoft is preparing a major re-branding exercise to overturn many consumers ' preconceptions about the console .
" europe is the true competitive front ; they see it as the tipping point , " said mr harding-rolls .
he added : " they realise now that the european market is not the us market . "
an industry insider told bbc news that microsoft had a " considerable war chest " to invest in re-positioning the image of the xbox 360 to mainland europe .
and software titles that appeal to a wider demographic will be a large part of that strategy .
at e3 microsoft is expect to place a large amount of emphasis on family and social games , through software and peripherals .
in many ways microsoft is attempting to wrestle away some of the success nintendo has had with its wii console .
but the job of re-inventing the xbox 360 for a whole new market of gamers was " a big gamble " , said mr parker .
" but , " he added , " they have got to do it . "
nintendo wii " no-one predicted how successful the wii was going to be , " said mr harding-rolls .
factfile : wii after failing to deliver the success it had hoped for with the gamecube , nintendo surprised many by taking a completely different route with its follow-up , the wii .
" nintendo was really astute to recognise the potential of social gaming and to see its popularity on platforms like the pc , translate it to the console space and have it on primary screens in the living room , " explained mr harding-rolls .
sony may have helped to pioneer social gaming on playstation 2 with singstar and eyetoy , but nintendo took the genre on and turned it into a global phenomenon .
" it 's almost a parallel games market , " said mr parker .
" there 's been a lot of talk recently about whether what they do is games or lifestyle assistants , " he added .
but that success has brought its own challenges .
" there are still question marks over its longevity , " said mr harding-rolls .
" of those people who go out and buy hardware and wii fit , how many will buy follow-up software ? "
but he added : " but it 's not a fad .
it 's a legitimate product with legitimate customer base . "
there are also question marks about some developers ' commitment to the platform long term .
" they are not investing huge amounts of cash into the market and letting nintendo alone drive hardware sales , " said mr parker .
developer david braben , whose firm frontier produced lost winds for the wii , said the console was a key part of its plans .
he said : " there has been quite a lot of differentiation between the consoles , which has n't happened before with console generations .
" the type of people who buy wii contrast with those who buy the other consoles .
that lets us develop something new and fresh for the console , instead of just another sequel . "
sony playstation 3 delays , resentment over its high price , confusion over differing models and features around the world ; the birth of playstation 3 was anything but smooth .
factfile : playstation 3 but all the signs point to sony steering the playstation 3 into smoother waters .
mr parker said : " they are pretty much on track .
analysts and journalists were expecting too much too quickly on playstation 3 .
" it was always going to take a long time .
but they are very loyal to playstation in europe and now that the big games are hitting the shops people are buying the machine . "
mr harding-rolls added : " to analysts , sony 's launch figures were very good . "
for sony , the next 12 months is about maintaining its momentum and trying to differentiate the ps3 from its direct rival , the xbox 360 .
at e3 the company is tipped to push connectivity between the playstation portable and the ps3 , as well as growing the use of user-generated content in gaming through the use of peripherals like eyetoy .
the company 's plans for the device as a multimedia hub are also expected to take shape at e3 , with reports of a movie download store and confirmation dates for the launch of peripherals like play tv and its virtual world , home , expected .
long-awaited games such as killzone 2 and littlebigplanet are now on the near horizon and sony will be keen to flex its first-party development muscles .
mr harding-rolls said : " their key differentiator from rivals is their internal development capability .
the potential is there but they have n't fully delivered .
" nintendo may be more prolific but they do n't have as many staff as sony . "

difficult and expensive launch periods have been completed , developers have got to grips with the demands of new hardware and a growing market of gamers is hungry for new content .
but what lies ahead for sony , microsoft and nintendo ?
microsoft xbox 360 eight years after bill gates first announced plans for a microsoft games console , called the xbox , the company has yet to lead the market significantly in any territory .
factfile : xbox 360 and for all the billions of dollars invested in xbox the company has yet to see any financial return .
so has the xbox project being a failure ?
analyst nick parker , who has worked for all the console firms , said : " one could look at the maths and say yes , from a business point of view you would not have made the same moves seven years ago .
" but in terms of what they have achieved they have certainly built up the best online gaming console for the masses . "
he added : " it has n't been an easy ride for them ; they made some early mistakes with the brand and the product itself . "
the ugly black box of the original xbox , its oversized controllers and noisy fan turned many gamers off .
" there is a lot of negative heritage from the previous model , " said mr parker .
determined to get to market early , the xbox 360 was the first of the current generation devices to reach eager gamers .
piers harding-rolls , an analyst with screen digest , said : " they had a head of steam built but did n't deliver on it .
" despite their early launch and success of xbox they did n't build up a successful brand on continental europe . "
the xbox 360 has become synonymous with hard-core gaming , fuelled by the success of action titles such as gears of war and the halo franchise , and across continental europe it is an image which turns many gamers off .
mr parker said : " their issues are still with the brand in europe .
they are fighting a very robust legacy brand in playstation . "
but microsoft is preparing a major re-branding exercise to overturn many consumers ' preconceptions about the console .
" europe is the true competitive front ; they see it as the tipping point , " said mr harding-rolls .
he added : " they realise now that the european market is not the us market . "
an industry insider told bbc news that microsoft had a " considerable war chest " to invest in re-positioning the image of the xbox 360 to mainland europe .
and software titles that appeal to a wider demographic will be a large part of that strategy .
at e3 microsoft is expect to place a large amount of emphasis on family and social games , through software and peripherals .
in many ways microsoft is attempting to wrestle away some of the success nintendo has had with its wii console .
but the job of re-inventing the xbox 360 for a whole new market of gamers was " a big gamble " , said mr parker .
" but , " he added , " they have got to do it . "
nintendo wii " no-one predicted how successful the wii was going to be , " said mr harding-rolls .
factfile : wii after failing to deliver the success it had hoped for with the gamecube , nintendo surprised many by taking a completely different route with its follow-up , the wii .
" nintendo was really astute to recognise the potential of social gaming and to see its popularity on platforms like the pc , translate it to the console space and have it on primary screens in the living room , " explained mr harding-rolls .
sony may have helped to pioneer social gaming on playstation 2 with singstar and eyetoy , but nintendo took the genre on and turned it into a global phenomenon .
" it 's almost a parallel games market , " said mr parker .
" there 's been a lot of talk recently about whether what they do is games or lifestyle assistants , " he added .
but that success has brought its own challenges .
" there are still question marks over its longevity , " said mr harding-rolls .
" of those people who go out and buy hardware and wii fit , how many will buy follow-up software ? "
but he added : " but it 's not a fad .
it 's a legitimate product with legitimate customer base . "
there are also question marks about some developers ' commitment to the platform long term .
" they are not investing huge amounts of cash into the market and letting nintendo alone drive hardware sales , " said mr parker .
developer david braben , whose firm frontier produced lost winds for the wii , said the console was a key part of its plans .
he said : " there has been quite a lot of differentiation between the consoles , which has n't happened before with console generations .
" the type of people who buy wii contrast with those who buy the other consoles .
that lets us develop something new and fresh for the console , instead of just another sequel . "
sony playstation 3 delays , resentment over its high price , confusion over differing models and features around the world ; the birth of playstation 3 was anything but smooth .
factfile : playstation 3 but all the signs point to sony steering the playstation 3 into smoother waters .
mr parker said : " they are pretty much on track .
analysts and journalists were expecting too much too quickly on playstation 3 .
" it was always going to take a long time .
but they are very loyal to playstation in europe and now that the big games are hitting the shops people are buying the machine . "
mr harding-rolls added : " to analysts , sony 's launch figures were very good . "
for sony , the next 12 months is about maintaining its momentum and trying to differentiate the ps3 from its direct rival , the xbox 360 .
at e3 the company is tipped to push connectivity between the playstation portable and the ps3 , as well as growing the use of user-generated content in gaming through the use of peripherals like eyetoy .
the company 's plans for the device as a multimedia hub are also expected to take shape at e3 , with reports of a movie download store and confirmation dates for the launch of peripherals like play tv and its virtual world , home , expected .
long-awaited games such as killzone 2 and littlebigplanet are now on the near horizon and sony will be keen to flex its first-party development muscles .
mr harding-rolls said : " their key differentiator from rivals is their internal development capability .
the potential is there but they have n't fully delivered .
" nintendo may be more prolific but they do n't have as many staff as sony . "

it 's a legitimate product with legitimate customer base . "
there are also question marks about some developers ' commitment to the platform long term .
" they are not investing huge amounts of cash into the market and letting nintendo alone drive hardware sales , " said mr parker .
developer david braben , whose firm frontier produced lost winds for the wii , said the console was a key part of its plans .
he said : " there has been quite a lot of differentiation between the consoles , which has n't happened before with console generations .
" the type of people who buy wii contrast with those who buy the other consoles .
that lets us develop something new and fresh for the console , instead of just another sequel . "
sony playstation 3 delays , resentment over its high price , confusion over differing models and features around the world ; the birth of playstation 3 was anything but smooth .
factfile : playstation 3 but all the signs point to sony steering the playstation 3 into smoother waters .
mr parker said : " they are pretty much on track .
analysts and journalists were expecting too much too quickly on playstation 3 .
" it was always going to take a long time .
but they are very loyal to playstation in europe and now that the big games are hitting the shops people are buying the machine . "
mr harding-rolls added : " to analysts , sony 's launch figures were very good . "
for sony , the next 12 months is about maintaining its momentum and trying to differentiate the ps3 from its direct rival , the xbox 360 .
at e3 the company is tipped to push connectivity between the playstation portable and the ps3 , as well as growing the use of user-generated content in gaming through the use of peripherals like eyetoy .
the company 's plans for the device as a multimedia hub are also expected to take shape at e3 , with reports of a movie download store and confirmation dates for the launch of peripherals like play tv and its virtual world , home , expected .
long-awaited games such as killzone 2 and littlebigplanet are now on the near horizon and sony will be keen to flex its first-party development muscles .
mr harding-rolls said : " their key differentiator from rivals is their internal development capability .
the potential is there but they have n't fully delivered .
" nintendo may be more prolific but they do n't have as many staff as sony . "

israeli pm ehud olmert said his country had never been so close to reaching an agreement with the palestinians as now .
palestinian leader mahmoud abbas said both were serious and wanted peace .
leaders from 43 nations have launched the union for the mediterranean , which has ending conflict in the middle east as one of its main priorities .
it will also tackle issues like immigration and pollution .
the summit 's host , french president nicolas sarkozy , said the aim was to see that the region was a place where people could love each other instead of making war .
mr sarkozy urged middle eastern countries involved in long-running conflicts to end the deadly spiral of war and violence , as european nations had done by making peace which each other during the 20th century .
he said the presidency of the european union - which france currently holds - was committed to progress on middle east peace .
syria talks speaking after the summit , the syrian president bashar al-assad said it could take between six months and two years to reach a peace agreement with israel - even if both sides agreed to hold face to face talks .
turkey is currently acting as a mediator between the two countries . "
we have never been as close to the possibility of coming to an agreement as we are today " ehud olmert in a french tv interview , president assad also said he did not believe any accord could be reached this year , while president bush remains in office in the us .
earlier , israeli prime minister ehud olmert said he hoped the indirect talks would soon become direct ones .
ahead of the summit , mr sarkozy addressed the media alongside the palestinian and israeli leaders .
mr sarkozy said the role of europe and france was to help achieve peace through economic development , political initiatives and providing guarantees for all stakeholders .
he said the main problem was one of confidence .
mr olmert said there would be " obstacles , problems , disagreements but we have never been as close to the possibility of coming to an agreement as we are today " .
for his part , mr abbas sounded a positive note about future peace talks .
" we have no alternative but to achieve this peace , " he said .
" for the sake of our peoples , the palestinian and israeli peoples , the peoples of the middle east and for the people of the world .
because we know that peace in the middle east is the basis of peace in the world . "
israeli government spokesman mark regev was quoted by ap news agency as saying that the prime minister had " agreed in principle " to release an unspecified number of palestinian prisoners .
israel 's haaretz newspaper said this would be unrelated to the prisoner exchange deals the government is conducting with hezbollah and hamas .
there are thousands of palestinian prisoners in israeli jails .
mr olmert is under pressure at home , where he is facing serious corruption allegations .
there have been calls for the prime minister , who denies any wrongdoing , to resign .
optimistic bbc europe editor mark mardell , in paris , said the meeting had been very optimistic .
progress has already been made in other areas .
mr sarkozy announced on saturday that syria and lebanon had agreed to set up embassies in each other 's capitals for the first time .
relations between the two have been strained since lebanon 's former pm rafik hariri was assassinated in 2005 - an attack which lebanon claims syria was involved in . "
mr sarkozy is one of those politicians who is full of surprises because he is always campaigning " mardell blog : sea of tranquillity ?
mediterranean union is launched the french president also asked syria 's leader bashar al-assad to use his ties with iran to help resolve the international stand-off over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
mr sarkozy has long spearheaded the idea of a union for the mediterranean .
comprising 27 eu members with states from north africa , the balkans , israel and the arab world , the new body membership will include 756m people from western europe to the jordanian desert .
he recently claimed the grouping could transform the mediterranean region into an area of peace and prosperity .
critics have dismissed the new union as lacking substance , and diplomats say there are continuing disagreements over key issues such as how to address the middle east peace process and a possible role for the arab league .
the only european or mediterranean rim leader boycotting the paris meeting is libyan president muammar gaddafi , who has described the union as a new form of colonialism .
