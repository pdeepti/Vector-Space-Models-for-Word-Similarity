however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.06.2008 financial incentive gets german dads staying home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fathers take two months off work , but few take more according to the government , a parental leave benefit for new fathers introduced 18 months ago is helping usher in a " revolution " on the home front and even boost the birthrate .
but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .
in contrast , 85 percent of women remain at home with their new baby for a whole year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .

spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

croatia took the lead on 24 minutes with a move of delightful fluency . quick , zipped passes and intelligent running off the ball created space for left-back danijel pranjic and his pin-point cross picked out darijo srna at the back post .
he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a poll in february showed strong opposition to deploying german troops to the volatile south of the country , with 85 percent of the 1,001 surveyed opposed . germany has come under pressure from its nato allies to increase its efforts in afghanistan , and in particular to provide combat troops to assist the us , british , canadian and dutch forces in the embattled south . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .

family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .

investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .

kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .

investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .
fans talked of a team that was " tired . "
disappointing finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey played tough captain ludovic magnin readily admitted afterwards mistakes were made .
he said the team had still played well and fought hard but " we created some good chances but did n't score . "
it was a disappointing end too to the career of swiss coach koebi kuhn , who is set to retire .
" i ca n't criticize anyone , and i do n't think i have anything to reproach myself for either , " kuhn said .
turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .
" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .
" the players need it for their confidence and i congratulate them on their incredible efforts . "
" the three points give us a lot of hope for the last match -lrb- against czech republic on sunday -rrb- .

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .
fans talked of a team that was " tired . "
disappointing finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey played tough captain ludovic magnin readily admitted afterwards mistakes were made .
he said the team had still played well and fought hard but " we created some good chances but did n't score . "
it was a disappointing end too to the career of swiss coach koebi kuhn , who is set to retire .
" i ca n't criticize anyone , and i do n't think i have anything to reproach myself for either , " kuhn said .
turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .
" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .
" the players need it for their confidence and i congratulate them on their incredible efforts . "

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .
fans talked of a team that was " tired . "
disappointing finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey played tough captain ludovic magnin readily admitted afterwards mistakes were made .

" i ca n't criticize anyone , and i do n't think i have anything to reproach myself for either , " kuhn said .
turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .
" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .
" the players need it for their confidence and i congratulate them on their incredible efforts . "

however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.06.2008 financial incentive gets german dads staying home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fathers take two months off work , but few take more according to the government , a parental leave benefit for new fathers introduced 18 months ago is helping usher in a " revolution " on the home front and even boost the birthrate .
but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .
in contrast , 85 percent of women remain at home with their new baby for a whole year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .
" i assume that the court will forego his testimony , " pierer 's lawyer winfried seibert was quoted by the financial times deutschland as saying in its thursday , june 12 edition .
kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .
in all , siemens has acknowledged that 1.3 billion euros disappeared into various funds following an internal probe that began in late 2006 .
investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .
a retired employee testified earlier this week that paying bribes at siemens ag was a part of normal business for years .
the witness , whose identity was withheld by the court , testified that he managed secret austrian bank accounts and made bribery payments ordered by superiors , including siekaczek .
von pierer could face fine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into corruption were launched in 2006 some 300 suspects are being investigated by munich prosecutors in an affair that led to the resignation of both von pierer and former ceo klaus kleinfeld .
von pierer , a high profile german industrial figure who was an advisor to chancellor angela merkel , headed siemens for 13 years .
prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , although he could be fined up to 1 million euros for dereliction of duty for failing to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , according to prosecutors . there have been allegations that pierer was warned about irregularities long before they became public .
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .
" i assume that the court will forego his testimony , " pierer 's lawyer winfried seibert was quoted by the financial times deutschland as saying in its thursday , june 12 edition .
kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .
in all , siemens has acknowledged that 1.3 billion euros disappeared into various funds following an internal probe that began in late 2006 .
investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .
a retired employee testified earlier this week that paying bribes at siemens ag was a part of normal business for years .
the witness , whose identity was withheld by the court , testified that he managed secret austrian bank accounts and made bribery payments ordered by superiors , including siekaczek .
von pierer could face fine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into corruption were launched in 2006 some 300 suspects are being investigated by munich prosecutors in an affair that led to the resignation of both von pierer and former ceo klaus kleinfeld .
von pierer , a high profile german industrial figure who was an advisor to chancellor angela merkel , headed siemens for 13 years .
prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , although he could be fined up to 1 million euros for dereliction of duty for failing to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , according to prosecutors . there have been allegations that pierer was warned about irregularities long before they became public .
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .
fans talked of a team that was " tired . "
disappointing finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey played tough captain ludovic magnin readily admitted afterwards mistakes were made .
he said the team had still played well and fought hard but " we created some good chances but did n't score . "
it was a disappointing end too to the career of swiss coach koebi kuhn , who is set to retire .
" i ca n't criticize anyone , and i do n't think i have anything to reproach myself for either , " kuhn said .
turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .
" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .
" the players need it for their confidence and i congratulate them on their incredible efforts . "
" the three points give us a lot of hope for the last match -lrb- against czech republic on sunday -rrb- .

" our report finds that ethiopia has been executing , torturing and raping civilians , " georgette gagnon , hrw 's africa director , told journalists at the launch of the report on thursday , june 12 , in nairobi .
" it has burned villages as part of a scorched earth campaign . " london , brussels and washington provide billions of dollars in aid and military assistance to ethiopia every year but are overlooking the issue , gagnon said . " the silence of donors amounts to complicity , " she added . hrw interviewed more than 100 victims and eyewitnesses in kenya , northern somalia and ethiopia to put together its case . few villages left to burn the report says that following an april 2007 attack on a chinese oil installation by the ogaden national liberation front -lrb- onlf -rrb- that killed more than 70 chinese and ethiopian civilians , the army responded with " brutal force " against ethnic somali civilians in the ogaden area of the somali region . according to hrw , the army has executed at least 150 people - many of them in demonstration killings - forcibly displaced tens of thousands of people , burned dozens of villages and conscripted civilians into militias to the fight the onlf . the peak of the abuses came last year , gagnon said .
however , it has only tailed off because most of the villages have already been burned , she added . the ethiopian government , which hrw says is orchestrating the campaign , has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and burning villages .
however , it heavily restricts access to the somali region , even preventing humanitarian aid from going in . hrw called on the us government , which sees ethiopia as a key ally in fighting terror in the horn of africa , to investigate reports of abuse and withdraw funding to the specific units involved . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i even believe that we will remain the world 's number one exporter in 2009 , " he said . boerner 's optimism that germany 's export machine will continue to hold its own against the growing might of china 's trading power comes despite the recent surge in the euro and signs that the global economy is losing momentum . exports to emerging countries rise however , strong demand from the world 's emerging economies resulted in german exports rising by 1.2 percent in april to produce a solid year-on-year increase of 13.9 percent , figures released monday showed . drawn up by germany 's statistics office , the figures also showed germany 's trade surplus widening to 18.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- in april , from 16.6 billion euros in march in the meantime , underscoring the major role played by demand from emerging economies in shoring up german exports , the statistics office said exports to nations outside the eu rose by 18.4 percent in april compared with the same month in 2007 . during the same period , german exports to its partners in the 27-member eu rose 11.6 percent .
exports to the 15-member euro zone jumped 10.8 percent over the year . boerner expressed surprise in response to the latest export data , but added that fresh data was needed before it was possible to conclude that the figures were an aberration . a change at the top of the world exporters league could be expected once the us manages to pull itself out of the economic trough it has slipped into . " we should be happy if america emerges this year from a mild recession , " said boerner . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.06.2008 british parliament approves tough terror law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british parliament approved draconian new terror measures british prime minister gordon brown narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when parliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial . british prime minister gordon brown wednesday , june 11 , narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when paliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial to six weeks . the government , faced with a major rebellion from within brown 's ruling labour party , won the vote in the lower house of parliament with a majority of just nine votes . these came from the nine members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- representing the democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- , the main protestant party in northern ireland . there had been unconfirmed reports that the dup support was secured by a deal promising a new financial package for the province . a breakdown showed that 37 labour mps voted against the government . draconian the measure , which still has to be passed by the upper house of parliament , would mean that britain could hold terror suspects in pre-trial detention for much longer than most other western democratic countries . earlier wednesday , brown defended the planned extension from currently 28 days to 42 days as a " necessity " in view of the growing complexity and sophistication of terror plots . speaking in parliament just hours before a crucial vote on the issue , brown said he would " fail in his duty " if he did not back proposals . brown ’ s reputation the vote was seen as crucial for brown who has recently been weakened by poor results for labour in local elections and negative opinion poll ratings . brown had been given an " important breathing space " to restore his reputation , one analyst said wednesday .
however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia took the lead on 24 minutes with a move of delightful fluency . quick , zipped passes and intelligent running off the ball created space for left-back danijel pranjic and his pin-point cross picked out darijo srna at the back post .
he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia took the lead on 24 minutes with a move of delightful fluency . quick , zipped passes and intelligent running off the ball created space for left-back danijel pranjic and his pin-point cross picked out darijo srna at the back post .
he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.06.2008 financial incentive gets german dads staying home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fathers take two months off work , but few take more according to the government , a parental leave benefit for new fathers introduced 18 months ago is helping usher in a " revolution " on the home front and even boost the birthrate .
but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .
in contrast , 85 percent of women remain at home with their new baby for a whole year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kabul , however , was hoping for up to $ 50 billion in extra aid to implement an ambitious reconstruction strategy . french president nicolas sarkozy opened the conference by promising to more than double french aid to 107 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- over three years , saying the aim of the donation was to " rid afghanistan of terrorists and drugs . " the united states , represented by first lady laura bush , promised nearly half of the total donations , with a $ 10.2 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euro -rrb- pledge over the next two years that still has to be approved by congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation remains precarious " afghanistan has reached a decisive moment for its future .
we must not turn our back on this opportunity , " bush told the representatives of 67 nations and 17 international organizations gathered at the conference . germany had announced ahead of thursday 's conference that it would contribute 420 million euros -lrb- $ 651 million -rrb- in aid to the war-torn country .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also urged kabul to fight corruption more vigorously . ambitious five-year plan afghan president hamid karzai on thursday tabled a sweeping $ 50-billion , five-year plan for the reconstruction of his country .
energy and agriculture are important needs , he said , but infrastructure and security are the main focus of the strategy , requiring some $ 17 billion and $ 14 billion in aid respectively . karzai asked the international community to improve the coordination of aid with his government in kabul .
" the current development process that is marred by confusion and parallel structures undermines institution building , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank has called for more transparency about the use of the funds the five-year plan acknowledges some successes since the removal of the taliban , such as the staging of democratic elections and moves toward building an army and getting more children back to school . oxfam policy and advocacy adviser matt waldman said the country 's reconstruction plan was the most candid so far in its description of the immense challenges facing the country .
he said the one omission was " peace building " at local levels to address instability , while the emphasis on private sector-led development did not sufficiently consider the difficult business environment there . " it is not going to change things overnight but it is a reasonably good foundation for future work , " he told afp news agency . corruption concerns human rights and international aid groups are skeptical about the ability of the afghan authorities to properly manage incoming donations . the world bank , which pledged $ 1.1 billion over five years , released a report earlier this week urging kabul to assume more accountability and requesting assurances that aid money would be properly spent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future can not just rely on force a recent finance ministry report said the afghan government spent only 55 percent of available development funds in the last fiscal year , one reason being a lack of capacity . aid organizations have said that much donated money and other aid never reaches the afghan population . getting the taliban involved french president nicolas sarkozy has called for increasing the use of civil organizations in afghan reconstruction , in order to integrate the radical islamic taliban in the effort . he has said the military approach , which costs $ 100 million a day , must not be the sole method used in afghanistan . currently , some 47,000 foreign soldiers , mostly from nato member states , are stationed in afghanistan , to support the 63,000-strong afghan army . dw staff -lrb- jg , kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from wesley sneijder 's favorite film to philipp lahm 's pet rabbits - soccer stars ' homepages promise normal fans personal access to their heroes .
but how much of such sites is genuine and how much fake ? it 's hard to imagine what an old-school , a-couple-of-pints-before-the-match-wo n't-hurt coach like brian clough would have thought , but the fact is that if you 're a young soccer star today , you must have a homepage .
footballers ' websites - to judge from some from the stars of euro 2008 - come in two basic varieties .
there are staidly professional virtual resumés , such as lahm 's or dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart 's , that communicate the latest news about the player 's health , performance and charitable activities .
a few childhood snapshots or wedding photos are as personal as they get .
then there are pages that play with the medium , offering flash animation , computer screen wallpapers , games and chat forums that ostensibly give admirers the chance to communicate with their idols .
and that 's where things turn a bit bizarre .
soccer 's pop-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack prefers the all-action style on and off the pitch on the guestbook of michael ballack 's homepage , a number of presumably female fans proclaim their undying love for germany 's photogenic number 13 .
one user wrote , " dearest michael , i am waiting for you to inspire me to compose a real poem , " while another asked the playmaker to score a goal for her in germany 's euro group stage match against croatia .
that 's not unusual , says the company that designed and maintains the site , dortmund 's 7 dead cats .
" seventy percent of visitors to michael ballack 's homepage are women , " 7dc chairman bernd huck told dw-world.de.
" he 's the one true pop star among german footballers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini goes for the " quiet reflection " approach male fans tend to offer advice , rather than protestations of undying amor .
" hey , schweini , remember to put the pedal to metal tomorrow , " posted one motivational specialist in german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger 's chatroom .
others offer words of consolation and strategic counsel in tough times .
" it 's not your fault - you did your best , " one user wrote to turkey 's hamit altintop .
" but you were out of position .
you should be playing in midfield , and tugay should take over for you at the back . "
personal input ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz poldi has his own princesses lighting up his page as heartfelt as most users ' missives are , one might be skeptical as to whether the intended recipients bother to read them .
at 7dc , designers meet up with the players , who decide on the details of the site and agree to write a more-or-less regular column .
" how intensively they get involved depends on the individual player himself , but we know that some do look at their pages regularly , " said huck .
" especially if they happen to get injured , they like hearing from fans .
it cheers them up . "
and some homepages do seem to bear a personal stamp .
altintop 's features hip-hop visual aesthetics that fit his public persona and background , while lukas podolski 's is available in polish as well as germany .
that made it a target after the polish-born striker scored two goals in germany 's opening match against the country of his birth .
" we received lots of threatening messages from poland , " huck said .
" of course , we did n't post them on the site . "
making friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamit altintop goes urban in the sweater he got from his nan 7dc said one of their primary goals was creating internet communities , and even if fans do n't necessarily get closer to the players , the homepages do allow them to communicate with one another .
on ballack 's site , for instance , one of the aforementioned posters offered some words of encouragement for another 's efforts to improve her english .
" you are doing great , " wrote the fan .
" you use new words and you have less -lsb- sic -rsb- grammatical errors . "
so at very least , player homepages can be a way to practice new skills and learn some thoroughly useless trivia - such as the fact that wesley sneijder 's favorite film is " prison break , " and philipp lahm 's pet rabbits are called brownie and milky way . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .
fans talked of a team that was " tired . "
disappointing finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey played tough captain ludovic magnin readily admitted afterwards mistakes were made .
he said the team had still played well and fought hard but " we created some good chances but did n't score . "
it was a disappointing end too to the career of swiss coach koebi kuhn , who is set to retire .
" i ca n't criticize anyone , and i do n't think i have anything to reproach myself for either , " kuhn said .
turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .
" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .
" the players need it for their confidence and i congratulate them on their incredible efforts . "
" the three points give us a lot of hope for the last match -lrb- against czech republic on sunday -rrb- .

croatia took the lead on 24 minutes with a move of delightful fluency . quick , zipped passes and intelligent running off the ball created space for left-back danijel pranjic and his pin-point cross picked out darijo srna at the back post .
he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

croatia took the lead on 24 minutes with a move of delightful fluency . quick , zipped passes and intelligent running off the ball created space for left-back danijel pranjic and his pin-point cross picked out darijo srna at the back post .
he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .
in contrast , 85 percent of women remain at home with their new baby for a whole year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.06.2008 british parliament approves tough terror law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british parliament approved draconian new terror measures british prime minister gordon brown narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when parliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial . british prime minister gordon brown wednesday , june 11 , narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when paliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial to six weeks . the government , faced with a major rebellion from within brown 's ruling labour party , won the vote in the lower house of parliament with a majority of just nine votes . these came from the nine members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- representing the democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- , the main protestant party in northern ireland . there had been unconfirmed reports that the dup support was secured by a deal promising a new financial package for the province . a breakdown showed that 37 labour mps voted against the government . draconian the measure , which still has to be passed by the upper house of parliament , would mean that britain could hold terror suspects in pre-trial detention for much longer than most other western democratic countries . earlier wednesday , brown defended the planned extension from currently 28 days to 42 days as a " necessity " in view of the growing complexity and sophistication of terror plots . speaking in parliament just hours before a crucial vote on the issue , brown said he would " fail in his duty " if he did not back proposals . brown ’ s reputation the vote was seen as crucial for brown who has recently been weakened by poor results for labour in local elections and negative opinion poll ratings . brown had been given an " important breathing space " to restore his reputation , one analyst said wednesday .
however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .
" i assume that the court will forego his testimony , " pierer 's lawyer winfried seibert was quoted by the financial times deutschland as saying in its thursday , june 12 edition .
kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .
in all , siemens has acknowledged that 1.3 billion euros disappeared into various funds following an internal probe that began in late 2006 .
investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .
a retired employee testified earlier this week that paying bribes at siemens ag was a part of normal business for years .
the witness , whose identity was withheld by the court , testified that he managed secret austrian bank accounts and made bribery payments ordered by superiors , including siekaczek .
von pierer could face fine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into corruption were launched in 2006 some 300 suspects are being investigated by munich prosecutors in an affair that led to the resignation of both von pierer and former ceo klaus kleinfeld .
von pierer , a high profile german industrial figure who was an advisor to chancellor angela merkel , headed siemens for 13 years .
prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , although he could be fined up to 1 million euros for dereliction of duty for failing to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , according to prosecutors . there have been allegations that pierer was warned about irregularities long before they became public .
siemens employs around 400,000 people around the world and makes a broad range of products including household appliances , medical equipment , trains , turbines and power stations . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kabul , however , was hoping for up to $ 50 billion in extra aid to implement an ambitious reconstruction strategy . french president nicolas sarkozy opened the conference by promising to more than double french aid to 107 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- over three years , saying the aim of the donation was to " rid afghanistan of terrorists and drugs . " the united states , represented by first lady laura bush , promised nearly half of the total donations , with a $ 10.2 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euro -rrb- pledge over the next two years that still has to be approved by congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation remains precarious " afghanistan has reached a decisive moment for its future .
we must not turn our back on this opportunity , " bush told the representatives of 67 nations and 17 international organizations gathered at the conference . germany had announced ahead of thursday 's conference that it would contribute 420 million euros -lrb- $ 651 million -rrb- in aid to the war-torn country .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also urged kabul to fight corruption more vigorously . ambitious five-year plan afghan president hamid karzai on thursday tabled a sweeping $ 50-billion , five-year plan for the reconstruction of his country .
energy and agriculture are important needs , he said , but infrastructure and security are the main focus of the strategy , requiring some $ 17 billion and $ 14 billion in aid respectively . karzai asked the international community to improve the coordination of aid with his government in kabul .
" the current development process that is marred by confusion and parallel structures undermines institution building , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank has called for more transparency about the use of the funds the five-year plan acknowledges some successes since the removal of the taliban , such as the staging of democratic elections and moves toward building an army and getting more children back to school . oxfam policy and advocacy adviser matt waldman said the country 's reconstruction plan was the most candid so far in its description of the immense challenges facing the country .
he said the one omission was " peace building " at local levels to address instability , while the emphasis on private sector-led development did not sufficiently consider the difficult business environment there . " it is not going to change things overnight but it is a reasonably good foundation for future work , " he told afp news agency . corruption concerns human rights and international aid groups are skeptical about the ability of the afghan authorities to properly manage incoming donations . the world bank , which pledged $ 1.1 billion over five years , released a report earlier this week urging kabul to assume more accountability and requesting assurances that aid money would be properly spent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future can not just rely on force a recent finance ministry report said the afghan government spent only 55 percent of available development funds in the last fiscal year , one reason being a lack of capacity . aid organizations have said that much donated money and other aid never reaches the afghan population . getting the taliban involved french president nicolas sarkozy has called for increasing the use of civil organizations in afghan reconstruction , in order to integrate the radical islamic taliban in the effort . he has said the military approach , which costs $ 100 million a day , must not be the sole method used in afghanistan . currently , some 47,000 foreign soldiers , mostly from nato member states , are stationed in afghanistan , to support the 63,000-strong afghan army . dw staff -lrb- jg , kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .

" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .

kabul , however , was hoping for up to $ 50 billion in extra aid to implement an ambitious reconstruction strategy . french president nicolas sarkozy opened the conference by promising to more than double french aid to 107 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- over three years , saying the aim of the donation was to " rid afghanistan of terrorists and drugs . " the united states , represented by first lady laura bush , promised nearly half of the total donations , with a $ 10.2 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euro -rrb- pledge over the next two years that still has to be approved by congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation remains precarious " afghanistan has reached a decisive moment for its future .
we must not turn our back on this opportunity , " bush told the representatives of 67 nations and 17 international organizations gathered at the conference . germany had announced ahead of thursday 's conference that it would contribute 420 million euros -lrb- $ 651 million -rrb- in aid to the war-torn country .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also urged kabul to fight corruption more vigorously . ambitious five-year plan afghan president hamid karzai on thursday tabled a sweeping $ 50-billion , five-year plan for the reconstruction of his country .
energy and agriculture are important needs , he said , but infrastructure and security are the main focus of the strategy , requiring some $ 17 billion and $ 14 billion in aid respectively . karzai asked the international community to improve the coordination of aid with his government in kabul .
" the current development process that is marred by confusion and parallel structures undermines institution building , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank has called for more transparency about the use of the funds the five-year plan acknowledges some successes since the removal of the taliban , such as the staging of democratic elections and moves toward building an army and getting more children back to school . oxfam policy and advocacy adviser matt waldman said the country 's reconstruction plan was the most candid so far in its description of the immense challenges facing the country .
he said the one omission was " peace building " at local levels to address instability , while the emphasis on private sector-led development did not sufficiently consider the difficult business environment there . " it is not going to change things overnight but it is a reasonably good foundation for future work , " he told afp news agency . corruption concerns human rights and international aid groups are skeptical about the ability of the afghan authorities to properly manage incoming donations . the world bank , which pledged $ 1.1 billion over five years , released a report earlier this week urging kabul to assume more accountability and requesting assurances that aid money would be properly spent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future can not just rely on force a recent finance ministry report said the afghan government spent only 55 percent of available development funds in the last fiscal year , one reason being a lack of capacity . aid organizations have said that much donated money and other aid never reaches the afghan population . getting the taliban involved french president nicolas sarkozy has called for increasing the use of civil organizations in afghan reconstruction , in order to integrate the radical islamic taliban in the effort . he has said the military approach , which costs $ 100 million a day , must not be the sole method used in afghanistan . currently , some 47,000 foreign soldiers , mostly from nato member states , are stationed in afghanistan , to support the 63,000-strong afghan army . dw staff -lrb- jg , kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- .

spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .

turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .

" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .
fans talked of a team that was " tired . "
disappointing finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey played tough captain ludovic magnin readily admitted afterwards mistakes were made .
he said the team had still played well and fought hard but " we created some good chances but did n't score . "
it was a disappointing end too to the career of swiss coach koebi kuhn , who is set to retire .
" i ca n't criticize anyone , and i do n't think i have anything to reproach myself for either , " kuhn said .
turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .
" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .
" the players need it for their confidence and i congratulate them on their incredible efforts . "
" the three points give us a lot of hope for the last match -lrb- against czech republic on sunday -rrb- .

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .

turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .

" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our report finds that ethiopia has been executing , torturing and raping civilians , " georgette gagnon , hrw 's africa director , told journalists at the launch of the report on thursday , june 12 , in nairobi .
" it has burned villages as part of a scorched earth campaign . " london , brussels and washington provide billions of dollars in aid and military assistance to ethiopia every year but are overlooking the issue , gagnon said .

the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .

nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .

as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

kabul , however , was hoping for up to $ 50 billion in extra aid to implement an ambitious reconstruction strategy . french president nicolas sarkozy opened the conference by promising to more than double french aid to 107 million euros -lrb- $ 166 million -rrb- over three years , saying the aim of the donation was to " rid afghanistan of terrorists and drugs . " the united states , represented by first lady laura bush , promised nearly half of the total donations , with a $ 10.2 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euro -rrb- pledge over the next two years that still has to be approved by congress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation remains precarious " afghanistan has reached a decisive moment for its future .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also urged kabul to fight corruption more vigorously . ambitious five-year plan afghan president hamid karzai on thursday tabled a sweeping $ 50-billion , five-year plan for the reconstruction of his country .
energy and agriculture are important needs , he said , but infrastructure and security are the main focus of the strategy , requiring some $ 17 billion and $ 14 billion in aid respectively . karzai asked the international community to improve the coordination of aid with his government in kabul .

from wesley sneijder 's favorite film to philipp lahm 's pet rabbits - soccer stars ' homepages promise normal fans personal access to their heroes .
but how much of such sites is genuine and how much fake ? it 's hard to imagine what an old-school , a-couple-of-pints-before-the-match-wo n't-hurt coach like brian clough would have thought , but the fact is that if you 're a young soccer star today , you must have a homepage .
footballers ' websites - to judge from some from the stars of euro 2008 - come in two basic varieties .
there are staidly professional virtual resumés , such as lahm 's or dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart 's , that communicate the latest news about the player 's health , performance and charitable activities .
a few childhood snapshots or wedding photos are as personal as they get .
then there are pages that play with the medium , offering flash animation , computer screen wallpapers , games and chat forums that ostensibly give admirers the chance to communicate with their idols .

one user wrote , " dearest michael , i am waiting for you to inspire me to compose a real poem , " while another asked the playmaker to score a goal for her in germany 's euro group stage match against croatia .
that 's not unusual , says the company that designed and maintains the site , dortmund 's 7 dead cats .
" seventy percent of visitors to michael ballack 's homepage are women , " 7dc chairman bernd huck told dw-world.de.
" he 's the one true pop star among german footballers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini goes for the " quiet reflection " approach male fans tend to offer advice , rather than protestations of undying amor .
" hey , schweini , remember to put the pedal to metal tomorrow , " posted one motivational specialist in german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger 's chatroom .
others offer words of consolation and strategic counsel in tough times .
" it 's not your fault - you did your best , " one user wrote to turkey 's hamit altintop .
" but you were out of position .
you should be playing in midfield , and tugay should take over for you at the back . "

at 7dc , designers meet up with the players , who decide on the details of the site and agree to write a more-or-less regular column .
" how intensively they get involved depends on the individual player himself , but we know that some do look at their pages regularly , " said huck .
" especially if they happen to get injured , they like hearing from fans .

" you are doing great , " wrote the fan .

croatia took the lead on 24 minutes with a move of delightful fluency . quick , zipped passes and intelligent running off the ball created space for left-back danijel pranjic and his pin-point cross picked out darijo srna at the back post .
he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he beat the hesitant marcell jansen to the ball to prod home with an outstretched leg . another sweeping croatia move on the half hour should have resulted in a goal as ivan rakitic chipped the ball into ivica olic , who cushioned a header back for portsmouth 's nico kranjcar but he slipped as he shot and fired miles over with the german defense opened up like a tin . germany hit back with a 25-yard michael ballack free-kick that stipe pletikosa in the croat goal palmed to safety before also repelling a shot from miroslav klose moments later . the germans were pushing for an equalizer and center-back christoph metzelder headed narrowly over from a torsten frings corner . germans lucky to escape first half with only one goal against but croatia should have doubled their lead three minutes before the break as vedran corluka left jansen for dead and crossed into the box where olic teed up kranjcar once again , only for jens lehmann to make a stunning point-blank save from the midfielder 's left-foot volley . on the stroke of half-time germany had the ball in the net but klose 's effort was ruled out as mario gomes was penalized for the slightest of contacts with pletikosa . early in the second period germany did n't really look like getting back into the match despite a ballack snap shot that sailed over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann could only watch as olic poked home on 62 minutes the lead was doubled as rakitic 's right wing cross took a huge deflection off lukas podolski and beat lehmann at his near post , coming back off the upright and presenting olic with a simple tap in . germany did at last come alive and pletikosa had to divert behind a fierce cross-shot from substitute bastian schweinsteiger . poldi arrives late to give some hope podolski gave them a lifeline with 11 minutes to go as he thrashed home a loose ball in the box on the half-volley but it was n't enough . and germany 's misery was complete in stoppage time when schweinsteiger was dismissed for a push on substitute jerko leko . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .
" i assume that the court will forego his testimony , " pierer 's lawyer winfried seibert was quoted by the financial times deutschland as saying in its thursday , june 12 edition .
kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .

investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .
a retired employee testified earlier this week that paying bribes at siemens ag was a part of normal business for years .

prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , although he could be fined up to 1 million euros for dereliction of duty for failing to supervise the company 's affairs .

but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .
" i assume that the court will forego his testimony , " pierer 's lawyer winfried seibert was quoted by the financial times deutschland as saying in its thursday , june 12 edition .
kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .
in all , siemens has acknowledged that 1.3 billion euros disappeared into various funds following an internal probe that began in late 2006 .
investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .
a retired employee testified earlier this week that paying bribes at siemens ag was a part of normal business for years .
the witness , whose identity was withheld by the court , testified that he managed secret austrian bank accounts and made bribery payments ordered by superiors , including siekaczek .

prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , although he could be fined up to 1 million euros for dereliction of duty for failing to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , according to prosecutors . there have been allegations that pierer was warned about irregularities long before they became public .

" i even believe that we will remain the world 's number one exporter in 2009 , " he said . boerner 's optimism that germany 's export machine will continue to hold its own against the growing might of china 's trading power comes despite the recent surge in the euro and signs that the global economy is losing momentum . exports to emerging countries rise however , strong demand from the world 's emerging economies resulted in german exports rising by 1.2 percent in april to produce a solid year-on-year increase of 13.9 percent , figures released monday showed . drawn up by germany 's statistics office , the figures also showed germany 's trade surplus widening to 18.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- in april , from 16.6 billion euros in march in the meantime , underscoring the major role played by demand from emerging economies in shoring up german exports , the statistics office said exports to nations outside the eu rose by 18.4 percent in april compared with the same month in 2007 . during the same period , german exports to its partners in the 27-member eu rose 11.6 percent .
exports to the 15-member euro zone jumped 10.8 percent over the year . boerner expressed surprise in response to the latest export data , but added that fresh data was needed before it was possible to conclude that the figures were an aberration . a change at the top of the world exporters league could be expected once the us manages to pull itself out of the economic trough it has slipped into .

from wesley sneijder 's favorite film to philipp lahm 's pet rabbits - soccer stars ' homepages promise normal fans personal access to their heroes .
but how much of such sites is genuine and how much fake ? it 's hard to imagine what an old-school , a-couple-of-pints-before-the-match-wo n't-hurt coach like brian clough would have thought , but the fact is that if you 're a young soccer star today , you must have a homepage .
footballers ' websites - to judge from some from the stars of euro 2008 - come in two basic varieties .
there are staidly professional virtual resumés , such as lahm 's or dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart 's , that communicate the latest news about the player 's health , performance and charitable activities .
a few childhood snapshots or wedding photos are as personal as they get .

" our report finds that ethiopia has been executing , torturing and raping civilians , " georgette gagnon , hrw 's africa director , told journalists at the launch of the report on thursday , june 12 , in nairobi .
" it has burned villages as part of a scorched earth campaign . " london , brussels and washington provide billions of dollars in aid and military assistance to ethiopia every year but are overlooking the issue , gagnon said . " the silence of donors amounts to complicity , " she added . hrw interviewed more than 100 victims and eyewitnesses in kenya , northern somalia and ethiopia to put together its case . few villages left to burn the report says that following an april 2007 attack on a chinese oil installation by the ogaden national liberation front -lrb- onlf -rrb- that killed more than 70 chinese and ethiopian civilians , the army responded with " brutal force " against ethnic somali civilians in the ogaden area of the somali region . according to hrw , the army has executed at least 150 people - many of them in demonstration killings - forcibly displaced tens of thousands of people , burned dozens of villages and conscripted civilians into militias to the fight the onlf . the peak of the abuses came last year , gagnon said .
however , it has only tailed off because most of the villages have already been burned , she added . the ethiopian government , which hrw says is orchestrating the campaign , has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and burning villages .
however , it heavily restricts access to the somali region , even preventing humanitarian aid from going in . hrw called on the us government , which sees ethiopia as a key ally in fighting terror in the horn of africa , to investigate reports of abuse and withdraw funding to the specific units involved . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.06.2008 germany to stay export champion , says trade official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to statistics , germany 's trade surplus has risen despite a major challenge from china , germany will defend its title as the world 's export champion in the coming 12 months , according to a leading trade official . the slump in the dollar combined with slowing us growth would hurt chinese trade more than german trade , anton boerner , head of the bga exporters ' association told dpa news agency on wednesday , june 11 . " i even believe that we will remain the world 's number one exporter in 2009 , " he said . boerner 's optimism that germany 's export machine will continue to hold its own against the growing might of china 's trading power comes despite the recent surge in the euro and signs that the global economy is losing momentum . exports to emerging countries rise however , strong demand from the world 's emerging economies resulted in german exports rising by 1.2 percent in april to produce a solid year-on-year increase of 13.9 percent , figures released monday showed . drawn up by germany 's statistics office , the figures also showed germany 's trade surplus widening to 18.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- in april , from 16.6 billion euros in march in the meantime , underscoring the major role played by demand from emerging economies in shoring up german exports , the statistics office said exports to nations outside the eu rose by 18.4 percent in april compared with the same month in 2007 . during the same period , german exports to its partners in the 27-member eu rose 11.6 percent .
exports to the 15-member euro zone jumped 10.8 percent over the year . boerner expressed surprise in response to the latest export data , but added that fresh data was needed before it was possible to conclude that the figures were an aberration . a change at the top of the world exporters league could be expected once the us manages to pull itself out of the economic trough it has slipped into . " we should be happy if america emerges this year from a mild recession , " said boerner . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.06.2008 british parliament approves tough terror law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british parliament approved draconian new terror measures british prime minister gordon brown narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when parliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial . british prime minister gordon brown wednesday , june 11 , narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when paliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial to six weeks . the government , faced with a major rebellion from within brown 's ruling labour party , won the vote in the lower house of parliament with a majority of just nine votes . these came from the nine members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- representing the democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- , the main protestant party in northern ireland . there had been unconfirmed reports that the dup support was secured by a deal promising a new financial package for the province . a breakdown showed that 37 labour mps voted against the government . draconian the measure , which still has to be passed by the upper house of parliament , would mean that britain could hold terror suspects in pre-trial detention for much longer than most other western democratic countries . earlier wednesday , brown defended the planned extension from currently 28 days to 42 days as a " necessity " in view of the growing complexity and sophistication of terror plots . speaking in parliament just hours before a crucial vote on the issue , brown said he would " fail in his duty " if he did not back proposals . brown ’ s reputation the vote was seen as crucial for brown who has recently been weakened by poor results for labour in local elections and negative opinion poll ratings . brown had been given an " important breathing space " to restore his reputation , one analyst said wednesday .
however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .

siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .

but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .

but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .
in contrast , 85 percent of women remain at home with their new baby for a whole year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from wesley sneijder 's favorite film to philipp lahm 's pet rabbits - soccer stars ' homepages promise normal fans personal access to their heroes .
but how much of such sites is genuine and how much fake ? it 's hard to imagine what an old-school , a-couple-of-pints-before-the-match-wo n't-hurt coach like brian clough would have thought , but the fact is that if you 're a young soccer star today , you must have a homepage .
footballers ' websites - to judge from some from the stars of euro 2008 - come in two basic varieties .
there are staidly professional virtual resumés , such as lahm 's or dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart 's , that communicate the latest news about the player 's health , performance and charitable activities .
a few childhood snapshots or wedding photos are as personal as they get .
then there are pages that play with the medium , offering flash animation , computer screen wallpapers , games and chat forums that ostensibly give admirers the chance to communicate with their idols .
and that 's where things turn a bit bizarre .
soccer 's pop-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack prefers the all-action style on and off the pitch on the guestbook of michael ballack 's homepage , a number of presumably female fans proclaim their undying love for germany 's photogenic number 13 .
one user wrote , " dearest michael , i am waiting for you to inspire me to compose a real poem , " while another asked the playmaker to score a goal for her in germany 's euro group stage match against croatia .
that 's not unusual , says the company that designed and maintains the site , dortmund 's 7 dead cats .
" seventy percent of visitors to michael ballack 's homepage are women , " 7dc chairman bernd huck told dw-world.de.
" he 's the one true pop star among german footballers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini goes for the " quiet reflection " approach male fans tend to offer advice , rather than protestations of undying amor .
" hey , schweini , remember to put the pedal to metal tomorrow , " posted one motivational specialist in german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger 's chatroom .
others offer words of consolation and strategic counsel in tough times .
" it 's not your fault - you did your best , " one user wrote to turkey 's hamit altintop .
" but you were out of position .
you should be playing in midfield , and tugay should take over for you at the back . "
personal input ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz poldi has his own princesses lighting up his page as heartfelt as most users ' missives are , one might be skeptical as to whether the intended recipients bother to read them .
at 7dc , designers meet up with the players , who decide on the details of the site and agree to write a more-or-less regular column .
" how intensively they get involved depends on the individual player himself , but we know that some do look at their pages regularly , " said huck .
" especially if they happen to get injured , they like hearing from fans .
it cheers them up . "
and some homepages do seem to bear a personal stamp .
altintop 's features hip-hop visual aesthetics that fit his public persona and background , while lukas podolski 's is available in polish as well as germany .
that made it a target after the polish-born striker scored two goals in germany 's opening match against the country of his birth .
" we received lots of threatening messages from poland , " huck said .
" of course , we did n't post them on the site . "
making friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamit altintop goes urban in the sweater he got from his nan 7dc said one of their primary goals was creating internet communities , and even if fans do n't necessarily get closer to the players , the homepages do allow them to communicate with one another .
on ballack 's site , for instance , one of the aforementioned posters offered some words of encouragement for another 's efforts to improve her english .
" you are doing great , " wrote the fan .
" you use new words and you have less -lsb- sic -rsb- grammatical errors . "
so at very least , player homepages can be a way to practice new skills and learn some thoroughly useless trivia - such as the fact that wesley sneijder 's favorite film is " prison break , " and philipp lahm 's pet rabbits are called brownie and milky way . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our report finds that ethiopia has been executing , torturing and raping civilians , " georgette gagnon , hrw 's africa director , told journalists at the launch of the report on thursday , june 12 , in nairobi .
" it has burned villages as part of a scorched earth campaign . " london , brussels and washington provide billions of dollars in aid and military assistance to ethiopia every year but are overlooking the issue , gagnon said . " the silence of donors amounts to complicity , " she added . hrw interviewed more than 100 victims and eyewitnesses in kenya , northern somalia and ethiopia to put together its case . few villages left to burn the report says that following an april 2007 attack on a chinese oil installation by the ogaden national liberation front -lrb- onlf -rrb- that killed more than 70 chinese and ethiopian civilians , the army responded with " brutal force " against ethnic somali civilians in the ogaden area of the somali region . according to hrw , the army has executed at least 150 people - many of them in demonstration killings - forcibly displaced tens of thousands of people , burned dozens of villages and conscripted civilians into militias to the fight the onlf . the peak of the abuses came last year , gagnon said .
however , it has only tailed off because most of the villages have already been burned , she added . the ethiopian government , which hrw says is orchestrating the campaign , has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and burning villages .
however , it heavily restricts access to the somali region , even preventing humanitarian aid from going in . hrw called on the us government , which sees ethiopia as a key ally in fighting terror in the horn of africa , to investigate reports of abuse and withdraw funding to the specific units involved . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but turkey blocked a deal that would see the alliance working with the eu in the former serbian province .
the fate of international efforts there is uncertain . " we have agreed today to implement nato 's new tasks in kosovo .
with this decision nato will be able to assist kosovo in building the necessary democratic security institutions , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said at the meeting in brussels on thursday , june 12 . but the alliance failed to agree on a change to its current operational plan which would have allowed nato peacekeepers in kosovo to work directly with an eu law-enforcement mission , after turkey blocked the change over a dispute with cyprus , nato sources said . under a complex compromise proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon on thursday morning , nato 's 15,700-strong kfor peacekeeping force is meant to guarantee security in kosovo once the newborn country 's constitution comes into force on sunday . an eu mission , eulex , is meant to provide civilian law and order from the same date , taking over from the un mission which has performed that function hitherto . kfor and eulex are therefore expected to work together as the military and civilian arms of security in the new country .
ankara intransigent over cyprus but turkey , which is a member of nato but not the eu , refused to approve a change to kfor 's operational plan which would have allowed it to work officially with the eu because of an ongoing row with cyprus , which is a member of the eu but not nato . the move makes it unclear how the kfor-eulex relationship can now function on an official level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , the un and the eu will have to coordinate their missions somehow despite the row , however , nato members agreed to expand kfor 's mission to include training kosovo 's new army , the lightly-armed kosovo security force -lrb- ksf -rrb- , and to oversee the disbanding of its predecessor , the kosovo defense force -lrb- kdf -rrb- . " in the future , we , as kfor , will undertake the dismantling of the kdf and the formation of the ksf .
that means that we are making our contribution to stability in the region , " german defense minister franz josef jung said .
spain to stay in kosovo force the agreement came despite the fact that nato members spain , slovakia and romania have not recognized kosovo 's independence and therefore refuse to take part in training its armed forces . on thursday morning , spain agreed to approve the training mission as long as it was not expected to take part .
nato allies also agreed to set up a special fund for the mission , rather than funding it from the alliance 's common budget , diplomats said . spain confirmed that it would maintain its current 636 soldiers in kfor .
slovakia and romania said that they would decide on the training mission later . kosovo has been under un-led administration since nato bombers ended ethnic fighting in 1999 .
the un has provided civilian order in the province , while kfor has provided security .
strong opposition under a plan presented by un special envoy martti ahtisaari in 2007 , kosovo was meant to declare independence with serbia 's consent , and the un was meant to hand over its civilian law-enforcement role to the kosovo authorities under the supervision of eulex . serbia rejected the proposal , but the eu nevertheless ordered eulex to deploy in mid-february , in the expectation that the un would hand over when kosovo 's constitution came into force on june 15 . russia 's opposition in the un security council stalled that handover .
as a result , only some 300 of eulex 's planned 1,800 international staff have yet deployed , and their legal status in the country is challenged by its serb minority , belgrade and moscow . on thursday morning , ban proposed a way out of the deadlock by " reconfiguring " unmik and allowing eulex to take over many of its functions " under the un umbrella .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 12.06.2008 financial incentive gets german dads staying home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fathers take two months off work , but few take more according to the government , a parental leave benefit for new fathers introduced 18 months ago is helping usher in a " revolution " on the home front and even boost the birthrate .
but is it really ? in the first quarter of 2008 , one in five applications for parental leave benefits were made by fathers , germany 's family ministry said on wednesday , june 11 .
the number of men opting for the benefit which allows them to stay at home on two-thirds of their pay for a year is five times higher than it was before the scheme was introduced 18 months ago .
family minister ursula von der leyen said the fact that 18.5 percent of fathers had signed up for the leave scheme meant that germany was seeing a " revolution " on the home front .
a quiet revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more couples are sharing the childcare fathers in the eastern part of the country are leading the pack , von der leyen said - with the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania surpassing the national average with one in four fathers of newborns applying for parental leave in the first quarter of 2008 .
" it is impressive , " said von der leyen , who has seven children herself .
" we are experiencing a quiet revolution - more and more fathers are claiming time to spend with their children . "
" they no longer want to serve merely as the provider , “ she added .
" they want to participate in raising their family and be part of its day-to-day life . “ boosting the birth rate the measure was part of efforts by german chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government to raise the national birthrate , which is one of the lowest in europe along with italy and spain .
merkel has pinpointed the shrinking population as one of the country 's most pressing problems and pledged to make it easier for parents to combine a career and having children .
the fathers ' leave scheme is designed to facilitate women 's return to the workplace by offering their partners an opportunity to share childcare , thereby allaying women 's fears that having children will adversely affect their careers .
germany 's birthrate increased slightly to 1.4 children per woman last year , according to the family ministry , to reach its highest level in 17 years .
meanwhile , the government announced plans on thursday to lighten the financial burden for families by increasing their child benefits and tax breaks .
deceptive figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany seeing a revolution on the domestic front ?
however , von der leyen 's triumphant take on the figures belies the fact that most fathers actually take only a minimal break from work .
according to the federal statistics office , two thirds of men only apply for two months off , with only one in ten opting for the full 12 months available .

" i even believe that we will remain the world 's number one exporter in 2009 , " he said . boerner 's optimism that germany 's export machine will continue to hold its own against the growing might of china 's trading power comes despite the recent surge in the euro and signs that the global economy is losing momentum . exports to emerging countries rise however , strong demand from the world 's emerging economies resulted in german exports rising by 1.2 percent in april to produce a solid year-on-year increase of 13.9 percent , figures released monday showed . drawn up by germany 's statistics office , the figures also showed germany 's trade surplus widening to 18.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- in april , from 16.6 billion euros in march in the meantime , underscoring the major role played by demand from emerging economies in shoring up german exports , the statistics office said exports to nations outside the eu rose by 18.4 percent in april compared with the same month in 2007 . during the same period , german exports to its partners in the 27-member eu rose 11.6 percent .
exports to the 15-member euro zone jumped 10.8 percent over the year . boerner expressed surprise in response to the latest export data , but added that fresh data was needed before it was possible to conclude that the figures were an aberration . a change at the top of the world exporters league could be expected once the us manages to pull itself out of the economic trough it has slipped into .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.06.2008 british parliament approves tough terror law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british parliament approved draconian new terror measures british prime minister gordon brown narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when parliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial . british prime minister gordon brown wednesday , june 11 , narrowly survived a crucial challenge to his authority when paliament voted to raise the period terrorism suspects can be detained without trial to six weeks . the government , faced with a major rebellion from within brown 's ruling labour party , won the vote in the lower house of parliament with a majority of just nine votes . these came from the nine members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- representing the democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- , the main protestant party in northern ireland . there had been unconfirmed reports that the dup support was secured by a deal promising a new financial package for the province . a breakdown showed that 37 labour mps voted against the government . draconian the measure , which still has to be passed by the upper house of parliament , would mean that britain could hold terror suspects in pre-trial detention for much longer than most other western democratic countries . earlier wednesday , brown defended the planned extension from currently 28 days to 42 days as a " necessity " in view of the growing complexity and sophistication of terror plots . speaking in parliament just hours before a crucial vote on the issue , brown said he would " fail in his duty " if he did not back proposals . brown ’ s reputation the vote was seen as crucial for brown who has recently been weakened by poor results for labour in local elections and negative opinion poll ratings . brown had been given an " important breathing space " to restore his reputation , one analyst said wednesday .
however , the considerable opposition to the measure from within his own party also showed that his leadership continued to be under threat . threat to basic liberties former labour government minister frank dobson , who led the rejection camp , said britain 's tradition of civil liberties was under threat . " i believe this is quite a fundamental issue : we have had the right not to be locked up for a long time without charge since the year 1215 - this is one of the very few things that is actually in magna carta and we need to sustain it , " said dobson . in a sign of how tight the vote expected to be , the government took the unusual step of urging foreign secretary david miliband to cut short a visit to israel tuesday . the plans have been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of basic liberties . the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- said the measures would damage community relations and " undermine britain 's moral authority around the world . " the council said it was " concerned about the negative impact " the legislation could have on relations between younger members of the muslim community and the police . police skeptical a number of senior police chiefs , the head of the security services , and the chief prosecution agency have also said that they see no requirement for an extension of pre-trial detention .
application of the 42-day-rule would in each case be subject to a number of judicial and parliamentary safeguards . the government confirmed wednesday that in a last-minute concessions to rebels , it had promised to pay compensation to terror suspects who were released without charge after being held for 42 days . security breach meanwhile , news broke in britain the same day of a new embarrassing security breach for brown , when a british civil servant left top secret government documents on the seat of a train about to pull out of london 's waterloo station . the man has been suspended from his duties , the government said thursday , june 12 . according to the bbc , a passenger who found the files said they were marked " uk top secret “ and contained an 7-page long intelligence assessment of al-qaeda and another report pertaining to the state of iraq 's security forces including " embarrassing " revelations . it is believed they were both made by the government 's joint intelligence committee . the report on iraq was commissioned by the ministry of defence while the report on al-qaeda was commissioned jointly by the foreign office and the home office , or interior ministry . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was disappointing and we deserved a better result but at the end of the day it 's goals that count .
you have to score or you ca n't win , " said swiss federal sports minster samuel schmid , who was one of the 40,000 supporters who cheered on their team at st. jakob stadium .
the game got off to a promising start , with switzerland scoring a goal in the 32nd minute .
but a a downpour during the first half filled the field with water , making play difficult .
yet a number of tactical errors and missed chances led to their ultimate disappointment .
switzerland , which had lost its first game to the czech republic , suffered from the absence of their two main strikers , alex frei and marco streller , who were sidelined by injury .
fans talked of a team that was " tired . "
disappointing finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey played tough captain ludovic magnin readily admitted afterwards mistakes were made .
he said the team had still played well and fought hard but " we created some good chances but did n't score . "
it was a disappointing end too to the career of swiss coach koebi kuhn , who is set to retire .
" i ca n't criticize anyone , and i do n't think i have anything to reproach myself for either , " kuhn said .
turkey scored a goal just before the end of the game to break the tie .
" we had the chances to score a second goal against turkey when we were leading and then when it was 1-1 , notably when we got into a three-against-one position on a counter attack , " the coach said .
" but it was not to be .
it is painful , i wo n't try to hide that .
but as far as willingness to perform and commitment go , they were all there . "
the party must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the swiss fans lose interest ?
kuhn went on to reject a suggestion that his side 's exit would cast a cloud over the rest of the tournament .
" the party will go on .
switzerland is a multicultural country and there are enough germans , french , portuguese , italians and other nationalities here to ensure that it does , " kuhn said .
" it will remain a wonderful party and the swiss will not hold back and they deserve to celebrate .
i am very disappointed but life goes on , " he said .
the victory was a measure of revenge for the turks because the last time they met switzerland , in a world cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in istanbul , the swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a brawl .
" it 's a wonderful feeling , " said turkey coach fatih terim .
" the players need it for their confidence and i congratulate them on their incredible efforts . "

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .
" i assume that the court will forego his testimony , " pierer 's lawyer winfried seibert was quoted by the financial times deutschland as saying in its thursday , june 12 edition .
kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .
in all , siemens has acknowledged that 1.3 billion euros disappeared into various funds following an internal probe that began in late 2006 .
investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .
a retired employee testified earlier this week that paying bribes at siemens ag was a part of normal business for years .
the witness , whose identity was withheld by the court , testified that he managed secret austrian bank accounts and made bribery payments ordered by superiors , including siekaczek .

prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , although he could be fined up to 1 million euros for dereliction of duty for failing to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , according to prosecutors . there have been allegations that pierer was warned about irregularities long before they became public .

as the first corruption and bribery trial gets underway , von pierer ’ s attorney said his client wo n't testify . reinhard siekaczek , a former head of siemens ' fixed telephone unit icn , is on trial for allegedly paying kickbacks amounting to some 53 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- over three years .
siemens is europe 's largest engineering firm with headquarters in berlin and munich .
siekaczek , who has already admitted to setting up slush funds , has been charged with 58 counts of breach of trust , each of which could bring a jail sentence of up to five years .
siekaczek is not accused of personally pocketing any of the money .
during that time , von pierer was his boss .
while the former siemens head said he would take responsibility for things that happened during his time at the helm , he would not testify in the siekaczek case , which opened in the southern city of munich in may .
" i assume that the court will forego his testimony , " pierer 's lawyer winfried seibert was quoted by the financial times deutschland as saying in its thursday , june 12 edition .
kickbacks were commonplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer refuses to take the stand the siekaczek trial marks the beginning of criminal proceedings against siemens managers suspected of having taken part in the kickback system .

investigators have since determined that paying kickbacks to win foreign contracts was a widespread practice among siemens ' various divisions .
a retired employee testified earlier this week that paying bribes at siemens ag was a part of normal business for years .

prosecutors are not expected to charge him with a criminal offense , although he could be fined up to 1 million euros for dereliction of duty for failing to supervise the company 's affairs .
german law required executives to put " practicable organizational measures " in place to prevent crime , according to prosecutors . there have been allegations that pierer was warned about irregularities long before they became public .

police in the city of dujianyan stopped parents from holding a memorial ceremony at the rubble of a collapsed school where their children died .
journalists were told they were banned from the city , and some were detained .
parents have been demanding to know whether poorly-built schools played a part in the deaths of their children .
thousands of schoolchildren were among the 87,000 people killed or missing after the massive 12 may earthquake .
five million people also lost their homes , and officials estimate rebuilding work will take at least three years .
looking for blame the government 's rapid response to the disaster has drawn widespread praise , but tensions are emerging as efforts shift to focus on reconstruction .
parents who lost their children want to know why so many schools collapsed - something many blame on shoddy construction linked to local corruption . "
the government has done a good job so far but we need to know what is going to happen to us " bai tao , sichuan resident early on thursday , a number of parents tried to get the remains of the dujiangyan primary school to hold a small memorial , but a line of police stopped them from going inside .
the chinese media had been instructed not to cover this kind of story , and a member of the bbc and five other journalists were detained for a short time for approaching the parents .
" this is not censorship , " one policeman told the bbc 's china correspondent james reynolds .
police also reportedly cordoned off a collapsed middle school in juyuan after a 50-strong crowd gathered outside .
" all we want to do is remember them this day , " zhao deqin , a mother whose 15-year-old twin daughters died in the disaster , told reuters news agency .
in beichuan , where about 1,300 children were killed , parents were able to gather around the remains of a school to grieve .
mu qibing , whose 17-year-old son was killed , told reuters : " they said this building was strong and quake-proof , but when we saw it , the concrete was like talcum powder and the steel was as thin as noodles . "
" none of us have seen our children yet , not even after one month . "
beichuan suffered such severe damage that the whole town will be rebuilt in a new location .
' what happens now ? '
china is not holding any formal commemorations to mark the one month anniversary of the earthquake .
burning questions of bereaved the government has ordered its departments to cut spending so that funds can be allocated to reconstruction efforts .
" the government has done a good job so far but we need to know what is going to happen to us , " bai tao , who lost his home and business , told afp news agency .
" we business people have real problems .
but all we 've gotten is free water and instant noodles .
we need to know about the future , " he said .
the bbc 's china analyst , shirong chen , says the earthquake has brought about unexpected political and social change that will directly affect the reconstruction effort .
the unprecedented openness in china 's media coverage is likely to continue , he says , and there will be a demand for accountability in the way tens of millions of dollars of donations are used .
the earthquake has also injected a strong sense of national unity , he adds , with volunteers from all over the country pouring into disaster areas to work alongside soldiers and rescue teams .

police in the city of dujianyan stopped parents from holding a memorial ceremony at the rubble of a collapsed school where their children died .
journalists were told they were banned from the city , and some were detained .
parents have been demanding to know whether poorly-built schools played a part in the deaths of their children .
thousands of schoolchildren were among the 87,000 people killed or missing after the massive 12 may earthquake .
five million people also lost their homes , and officials estimate rebuilding work will take at least three years .
looking for blame the government 's rapid response to the disaster has drawn widespread praise , but tensions are emerging as efforts shift to focus on reconstruction .
parents who lost their children want to know why so many schools collapsed - something many blame on shoddy construction linked to local corruption .
the government has done a good job so far but we need to know what is going to happen to us bai tao , sichuan resident early on thursday , a number of parents tried to get the remains of the dujiangyan primary school to hold a small memorial , but a line of police stopped them from going inside .
the chinese media had been instructed not to cover this kind of story , and a member of the bbc and five other journalists were detained for a short time for approaching the parents .
" this is not censorship , " one policeman told the bbc 's china correspondent james reynolds .
police also reportedly cordoned off a collapsed middle school in juyuan after a 50-strong crowd gathered outside .
" all we want to do is remember them this day , " zhao deqin , a mother whose 15-year-old twin daughters died in the disaster , told reuters news agency .
in beichuan , where about 1,300 children were killed , parents were able to gather around the remains of a school to grieve .
mu qibing , whose 17-year-old son was killed , told reuters : " they said this building was strong and quake-proof , but when we saw it , the concrete was like talcum powder and the steel was as thin as noodles . "
" none of us have seen our children yet , not even after one month . "
beichuan suffered such severe damage that the whole town will be rebuilt in a new location .
' what happens now ? '
china is not holding any formal commemorations to mark the one month anniversary of the earthquake .
burning questions of bereaved the government has ordered its departments to cut spending so that funds can be allocated to reconstruction efforts .
" the government has done a good job so far but we need to know what is going to happen to us , " bai tao , who lost his home and business , told afp news agency .
" we business people have real problems .
but all we 've gotten is free water and instant noodles .
we need to know about the future , " he said .
the bbc 's china analyst , shirong chen , says the earthquake has brought about unexpected political and social change that will directly affect the reconstruction effort .
the unprecedented openness in china 's media coverage is likely to continue , he says , and there will be a demand for accountability in the way tens of millions of dollars of donations are used .
the earthquake has also injected a strong sense of national unity , he adds , with volunteers from all over the country pouring into disaster areas to work alongside soldiers and rescue teams .

in a tent , their possessions scattered around them , a couple sit looking at the last photograph taken of their 15-year-old son .
guo jun 's parents want an official explanation for why he died with tears streaming down their faces , they remember how it was taken just a few months ago at nearby beauty spot , on a rare break from schoolwork .
this couple is just one of thousands that lost an only child in the earthquake that struck china 's sichuan province exactly one month ago .
they are grieving , but they are also angry .
they want to know why so many schools collapsed during the quake .
their son , guo jun , was one of hundreds who died when juyuan middle school fell down on 12 may .
as soon as he heard about the disaster , his father , guo shiqiang , rushed to the school to search for his son .
" i called my son 's name , and i got many answers from the rubble , " he said .
" they were shouting , ' daddy , i am here !
save me ! ' . "
he managed to find his son and help pull him out , but guo jun died on the way to hospital .
seeking answers later , a surviving classmate told mr guo what had happened when the magnitude-8 earthquake struck .
guo jun was one of hundreds of students killed at his school " he told me they had no time to think .
everything just suddenly collapsed beneath them , " the 43-year-old farmer said .
he and his 40-year-old wife , fu hongfang , are now living with eight other families in a tent that was previously used to grow mushrooms .
they have brought along everything they own - a double bed , a sofa , a fridge and clothes that are hung up on bamboo poles .
they are still in the early stages of shock and can not sleep .
they do not want to think about the future .
" everything we did was for our son .
we miss him very much , " said mr guo .
but the couple are also angry .
they want officials to tell them why the school seemed to collapse so easily .
experts have already said the middle school , near the city of dujiangyan , was not built properly .
" i just want them to give us a proper answer , " said mr guo .
" if you have done something wrong , you have to admit it and correct it .
chairman mao told us this . "
' powerless ' mr guo and other local parents complain the local government is dragging its heels over the investigation into the school 's collapse .
many believe shoddy construction led to schools collapsing he believes local officials are corrupt and only beijing can help .
" why do government officials live well ?
why are they able to drive cars and live in villas ? "
mr guo asks .
" we can all see what 's happening .
i think the central government ought to conduct a full investigation . "
like many ordinary people in china , mr guo believes politics is a game played by other , more powerful people .
he knows only too well that the voices of those with no power , no money and no connections are seldom heard .
" look at the earthquake coverage on tv , there 's nothing about us powerless people who have suffered , " said mr guo .
" it 's all fake , " said his wife , pointing to the television .
the local government appears to be keeping a low profile .
officials declined to be interviewed by the bbc .
mr guo and his wife are determined , at least for the moment , to continue their fight for answers .
they , and other parents , have compiled a two-page list of all those who died in guo jun 's third-floor classroom .
but they are not hopeful they will ever find out what they need to know .

guo jun 's parents want an official explanation for why he died with tears streaming down their faces , they remember how it was taken just a few months ago at nearby beauty spot , on a rare break from schoolwork .
this couple is just one of thousands that lost an only child in the earthquake that struck china 's sichuan province exactly one month ago .
they are grieving , but they are also angry .
they want to know why so many schools collapsed during the quake .
their son , guo jun , was one of hundreds who died when juyuan middle school fell down on 12 may .
as soon as he heard about the disaster , his father , guo shiqiang , rushed to the school to search for his son .
" i called my son 's name , and i got many answers from the rubble , " he said .
" they were shouting , ' daddy , i am here !
save me ! ' . "
he managed to find his son and help pull him out , but guo jun died on the way to hospital .
seeking answers later , a surviving classmate told mr guo what had happened when the magnitude-8 earthquake struck .
guo jun was one of hundreds of students killed at his school " he told me they had no time to think .
everything just suddenly collapsed beneath them , " the 43-year-old farmer said .
he and his 40-year-old wife , fu hongfang , are now living with eight other families in a tent that was previously used to grow mushrooms .
they have brought along everything they own - a double bed , a sofa , a fridge and clothes that are hung up on bamboo poles .
they are still in the early stages of shock and can not sleep .
they do not want to think about the future .
" everything we did was for our son .
we miss him very much , " said mr guo .
but the couple are also angry .
they want officials to tell them why the school seemed to collapse so easily .
experts have already said the middle school , near the city of dujiangyan , was not built properly .
" i just want them to give us a proper answer , " said mr guo .
" if you have done something wrong , you have to admit it and correct it .
chairman mao told us this . "
' powerless ' mr guo and other local parents complain the local government is dragging its heels over the investigation into the school 's collapse .
many believe shoddy construction led to schools collapsing he believes local officials are corrupt and only beijing can help .
" why do government officials live well ?
why are they able to drive cars and live in villas ? "
mr guo asks .
" we can all see what 's happening .
i think the central government ought to conduct a full investigation . "
like many ordinary people in china , mr guo believes politics is a game played by other , more powerful people .
he knows only too well that the voices of those with no power , no money and no connections are seldom heard .
" look at the earthquake coverage on tv , there 's nothing about us powerless people who have suffered , " said mr guo .
" it 's all fake , " said his wife , pointing to the television .
the local government appears to be keeping a low profile .
officials declined to be interviewed by the bbc .
mr guo and his wife are determined , at least for the moment , to continue their fight for answers .
they , and other parents , have compiled a two-page list of all those who died in guo jun 's third-floor classroom .
but they are not hopeful they will ever find out what they need to know .

the exhibition will feature plans of how pontypridd 's so called " jewel " , ynysangharad park , can be revamped .
proposals for the park include reopening the grade ii listed lido , which closed in 1991 .
the plans can be seen at market street on friday from 1100bst , at the park itself on saturday from 1100bst and at pontypridd library from monday .
improvements suggested include new riverside gardens , a new play area and civic square , a horticulture area and improved links to the town centre .
the park , sometimes referred to as the jewel in pontypridd 's crown , has been identified as one of the key projects to transform the town centre .
separate multi-million pound plans to regenerate the town have recently been put forward .
they include redeveloping the indoor market , and building a new shopping centre on the site of the much-maligned taff vale precinct .
rhondda cynon taf council said that the park plans would depend on attracting external funding .
cabinet member for economic development and housing , councillor paul cannon , said : " our plans are ambitious .
" if further support can be provided by the heritage lottery fund , we firmly believe we can make our vision a reality , but additional external funding will be key in making this happen .
" we hope that plenty of people visit the exhibition and share their views and opinions on the proposals for the restoration of this jewel in pontypridd 's crown . "
the park , which attracts around 800,000 visitors each year , was opened by field marshal viscount allenby as a war memorial park on august 6 , 1923 .
the original plan for its layout included a formal design of tree-lined walks around various sports facilities .
more recently , pontypridd 's most famous son , tom jones , performed at the park for his 65th birthday in 2005 .
music festival the full ponty has also been staged there .

the lido at the park has been closed since 1991 they include redeveloping the indoor market , and building a new shopping centre on the site of the much-maligned taff vale precinct .
rhondda cynon taf council said that the park plans would depend on attracting external funding .
cabinet member for economic development and housing , councillor paul cannon , said : " our plans are ambitious .
" if further support can be provided by the heritage lottery fund , we firmly believe we can make our vision a reality , but additional external funding will be key in making this happen .
" we hope that plenty of people visit the exhibition and share their views and opinions on the proposals for the restoration of this jewel in pontypridd 's crown . "
the park , which attracts around 800,000 visitors each year , was opened by field marshal viscount allenby as a war memorial park on august 6 , 1923 .
the original plan for its layout included a formal design of tree-lined walks around various sports facilities .
more recently , pontypridd 's most famous son , tom jones , performed at the park for his 65th birthday in 2005 .

the decline from april 's 8.5 % rate had been expected , but analysts warned that the surging price of crude oil posed a continued threat .
beijing had pledged that tackling price rises was a priority .
food costs rose 19.9 % in may from a year earlier driven by demand for pork , but this was slower than in april .
non-food prices rose by 1.7 % in the period , compared with 1.8 % in april , the national bureau of statistics said .
despite inflation slowing , the key shanghai stock market fell by 3.3 % on expectations that there would be a further tightening of credit to stem inflation further .
lending curb high inflation increases worries that china 's economy may be overheating .
however , despite the government declaring it wants to tighten monetary policy in the battle against inflation , the authorities have not yet increased interest rates in 2008 although there were six rate rises in 2007 .
instead , banks have been told to increase the amount of money they hold in reserve and curb lending to limit credit growth .
earlier , figures had showed that china 's trade surplus fell 10 % in may from a year earlier on the back of the surging price of imports such as oil and other raw materials .
but the $ 20.2bn surplus for may was still up from $ 16.7bn in april and larger than many had predicted .
the surge of money into the country from exports poses a risk of pushing inflation even higher .
observers say that a global economic slowdown - which is resulting in richer nations importing fewer goods - may cut china 's surplus .

beijing had pledged that tackling price rises was a priority .
food costs rose 19.9 % in may from a year earlier driven by demand for pork , but this was slower than in april .
non-food prices rose by 1.7 % in the period , compared with 1.8 % in april , the national bureau of statistics said .

however , despite the government declaring it wants to tighten monetary policy in the battle against inflation , the authorities have not yet increased interest rates in 2008 although there were six rate rises in 2007 .
instead , banks have been told to increase the amount of money they hold in reserve and curb lending to limit credit growth .
earlier , figures had showed that china 's trade surplus fell 10 % in may from a year earlier on the back of the surging price of imports such as oil and other raw materials .
but the $ 20.2bn surplus for may was still up from $ 16.7bn in april and larger than many had predicted .
the surge of money into the country from exports poses a risk of pushing inflation even higher .

by giancarlo rinaldi south of scotland reporter , bbc scotland news website rural town centres have been hit by a string of store closures an unmistakeable distress signal has been sent out from countless locations across the south of scotland over the past few years .
help save our town centres .
in stranraer , dumfries , jedburgh , hawick and any number of other medium-sized towns the message appears to be exactly the same .
once-thriving shopping locations have seen visitor numbers dwindle while locals chose to travel elsewhere to make their purchases .
it often ends up with a scene where you could be forgiven for thinking that every other shop was called to let or closing down .
this week scottish labour leader wendy alexander was in jedburgh to see the work being done there to try to tackle the situation .
the jedburgh alliance seem to me to have done a great job of thinking through what the future of jedburgh high street might be wendy alexander labour leader the jedburgh alliance was set up several years ago to attempt to improve the town 's economic outlook .
by bringing together a range of interested groups it hopes to create one clear vision for the future .
ms alexander 's party has suggested that town centre trusts could be the way forward for such rural towns .
" parish councils have helped small towns in the north of england develop their high streets , " she said .
" that is really what we want to see made possible in scotland .
" the jedburgh alliance seem to me to have done a great job of thinking through what the future of jedburgh high street might be . "
retail vibrancy jedburgh is far from being the only town in this situation .
dumfries has been struggling to retain its retail vibrancy for many years .
a lot of hopes had been pinned on a £ 60m development bringing a large department store into the town along with other associated shops .
it ended up a victim of the global " credit crunch " .
property developer centros was forced to shelf its scheme which was seen as central to regenerating the town .
the jedburgh alliance has worked to boost the town 's fortunes now the council is looking at other avenues to achieve the same end result .
further west , in stranraer , they are unsure about whether or not to take a true development gamble .
it is the only site in scotland with uk government approval for a casino .
however , locals , including the church of scotland presbytery , have their reservations about becoming galloway 's mini-las vegas .
whatever they may decide , there are some signs of hope on the horizon .
hawick has shown that improvements can be made .
its heart of hawick project recently won an award as the best enterprise scheme in the country .
one solution it was praised as a culture-led facility which had brought wider economic benefits .
it would appear that this might be one solution to the problem .
what each town has to do is find a way of marking itself out as different from the rest .
they need to be able to offer something out of the ordinary to attract shoppers into town and remain appealing to locals .

by giancarlo rinaldi south of scotland reporter , bbc scotland news website an unmistakeable distress signal has been sent out from countless locations across the south of scotland over the past few years .
help save our town centres .
in stranraer , dumfries , jedburgh , hawick and any number of other medium-sized towns the message appears to be exactly the same .
once-thriving shopping locations have seen visitor numbers dwindle while locals chose to travel elsewhere to make their purchases .
it often ends up with a scene where you could be forgiven for thinking that every other shop was called to let or closing down .
this week scottish labour leader wendy alexander was in jedburgh to see the work being done there to try to tackle the situation . "
the jedburgh alliance seem to me to have done a great job of thinking through what the future of jedburgh high street might be " wendy alexander labour leader the jedburgh alliance was set up several years ago to attempt to improve the town 's economic outlook .
by bringing together a range of interested groups it hopes to create one clear vision for the future .
ms alexander 's party has suggested that town centre trusts could be the way forward for such rural towns .
" parish councils have helped small towns in the north of england develop their high streets , " she said .
" that is really what we want to see made possible in scotland .
" the jedburgh alliance seem to me to have done a great job of thinking through what the future of jedburgh high street might be . "
retail vibrancy jedburgh is far from being the only town in this situation .
dumfries has been struggling to retain its retail vibrancy for many years .
a lot of hopes had been pinned on a £ 60m development bringing a large department store into the town along with other associated shops .
it ended up a victim of the global " credit crunch " .
property developer centros was forced to shelf its scheme which was seen as central to regenerating the town .
now the council is looking at other avenues to achieve the same end result .
further west , in stranraer , they are unsure about whether or not to take a true development gamble .
it is the only site in scotland with uk government approval for a casino .
however , locals , including the church of scotland presbytery , have their reservations about becoming galloway 's mini-las vegas .
whatever they may decide , there are some signs of hope on the horizon .
hawick has shown that improvements can be made .
its heart of hawick project recently won an award as the best enterprise scheme in the country .
one solution it was praised as a culture-led facility which had brought wider economic benefits .
it would appear that this might be one solution to the problem .
what each town has to do is find a way of marking itself out as different from the rest .
they need to be able to offer something out of the ordinary to attract shoppers into town and remain appealing to locals .
the debate on how that should be achieved , however , is likely to continue for some time to come .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- experts question bt 's fibre trial bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 07:43 gmt , thursday , 12 june 2008 08:43 uk experts question bt 's fibre trial bt 's trial of super-fast broadband is unlikely to put the uk back in the fast lane analysts have said .
the telecoms firm is offering fibre to the home to 300 newly built homes in ebbsfleet , kent .
speeds will start at 2.5mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- with " bursts " of 100mbps and the service could be free to consumers on the trial .
" these speeds make it the slowest fibre service in europe " , said jupiter research analyst ian fogg .
" i am surprised .
this is a trial and i see no reason why they are n't trialling the highest speed the technology can deliver .
what is the point of a trial if you do n't really test things ? " he said .
but a bt spokesman said that the speeds would be " very decent " .
" higher in fact that anyone currently needs , " he added .
bt pointed out that while 10mbps would be a baseline minumum for customers , download speeds would increase depending on what the user was doing , such as downloading a movie .
and while the capacity is shared , customers would still get speeds of more than 50mbps when required , said bt .
it is also hoping to offer the service free for the first two years to all the 10,000 homes which will eventually be built at ebbsfleet , in a bid to kick-start next-generation broadband .
this plan has yet to be approved by ofcom .
conservative company bt 's fibre trial options 2.5mbps download speed / 0.5mbps upload speed 10mbps down / 2mbps up 10mbps down / 2mbps up , burst to 30mbps for downloads 10mbps down / 2mbps up , burst to 100mbps source : bt wholesale the uk has been criticised for its slow adoption of super-fast broadband .
cable provider virgin media is currently the only company offering speeds of up to 50mbps - albeit a trial - while some other isps are rolling out service offering speeds up to 24mbps .
bt pointed out network capacity using fibre affect all services across europe .
virgin customers with 20mbps connections have it " throttled back " during certain times of a day .
the longest you can actually run your 20mbps package at " top speed " before the throttles apply is seven minutes , said a bt spokesman .
in europe a handful of operators are offering download speeds of between 20 and 100mbps , with most also offering very fast upload speeds as well .
ebbsfleet will have 10,000 homes connected via fibre , although building will not be complete until 2020 .
bt has not yet announced any other new-build sites earmarked for fibre .
part of the reason for bt 's decision to market fibre trial speeds lower than they are techinically capable of could be natural caution .
" bt is historically a conservative company and has a tendency to suggest a lower performance than will be the case , " said andrew ferguson , editor of thinkbroadband , a broadband comparison and news site .
" how often people at ebbsfleet will see 100mbps speeds depends on how much capacity is available to link the site to broadband providers , and how much capacity they have out to the internet , " he said .
uploading speeds in the first instance , with just 300 homes earmarked for the trial , speeds are likely to far exceed 10mbps .
" but as more people sign up they may find that at peak times such as friday and sunday evenings they are only getting 10mbps , " said mr ferguson .
he said he was more disappointed by the upload speeds , which peaks at 2mbps .
having a fast upload speed makes it far quicker for people to put their own content online .
services which allow people to upload voice , pictures and videos needed higher speeds , said mr ferguson .
" uploading has been undersold but it offers the potential , for example , to bring about a sea-change in how media is produced , " he said .
" the bbc has been criticised for its regional coverage but with decent speeds people in those areas could upload their own video clips , " he said .

the telecoms firm is offering fibre to the home to 300 newly built homes in ebbsfleet , kent .
speeds will start at 2.5mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- with " bursts " of 100mbps and the service could be free to consumers on the trial .
" these speeds make it the slowest fibre service in europe " , said jupiter research analyst ian fogg .
" i am surprised .
this is a trial and i see no reason why they are n't trialling the highest speed the technology can deliver .
what is the point of a trial if you do n't really test things ? " he said .
but a bt spokesman said that the speeds would be " very decent " .
" higher in fact that anyone currently needs , " he added .
bt pointed out that while 10mbps would be a baseline minumum for customers , download speeds would increase depending on what the user was doing , such as downloading a movie .
and while the capacity is shared , customers would still get speeds of more than 50mbps when required , said bt .
it is also hoping to offer the service free for the first two years to all the 10,000 homes which will eventually be built at ebbsfleet , in a bid to kick-start next-generation broadband .
this plan has yet to be approved by ofcom .
conservative company bt 's fibre trial options 2.5mbps download speed / 0.5mbps upload speed 10mbps down / 2mbps up 10mbps down / 2mbps up , burst to 30mbps for downloads 10mbps down / 2mbps up , burst to 100mbps source : bt wholesale the uk has been criticised for its slow adoption of super-fast broadband .
cable provider virgin media is currently the only company offering speeds of up to 50mbps - albeit a trial - while some other isps are rolling out service offering speeds up to 24mbps .
bt pointed out network capacity using fibre affect all services across europe .
virgin customers with 20mbps connections have it " throttled back " during certain times of a day .
the longest you can actually run your 20mbps package at " top speed " before the throttles apply is seven minutes , said a bt spokesman .
in europe a handful of operators are offering download speeds of between 20 and 100mbps , with most also offering very fast upload speeds as well .
ebbsfleet will have 10,000 homes connected via fibre , although building will not be complete until 2020 .
bt has not yet announced any other new-build sites earmarked for fibre .
part of the reason for bt 's decision to market fibre trial speeds lower than they are techinically capable of could be natural caution .
" bt is historically a conservative company and has a tendency to suggest a lower performance than will be the case , " said andrew ferguson , editor of thinkbroadband , a broadband comparison and news site .
" how often people at ebbsfleet will see 100mbps speeds depends on how much capacity is available to link the site to broadband providers , and how much capacity they have out to the internet , " he said .
uploading speeds in the first instance , with just 300 homes earmarked for the trial , speeds are likely to far exceed 10mbps .
" but as more people sign up they may find that at peak times such as friday and sunday evenings they are only getting 10mbps , " said mr ferguson .
he said he was more disappointed by the upload speeds , which peaks at 2mbps .
having a fast upload speed makes it far quicker for people to put their own content online .
services which allow people to upload voice , pictures and videos needed higher speeds , said mr ferguson .
" uploading has been undersold but it offers the potential , for example , to bring about a sea-change in how media is produced , " he said .
" the bbc has been criticised for its regional coverage but with decent speeds people in those areas could upload their own video clips , " he said .

" but as more people sign up they may find that at peak times such as friday and sunday evenings they are only getting 10mbps , " said mr ferguson .
he said he was more disappointed by the upload speeds , which peaks at 2mbps .
having a fast upload speed makes it far quicker for people to put their own content online .
services which allow people to upload voice , pictures and videos needed higher speeds , said mr ferguson .
" uploading has been undersold but it offers the potential , for example , to bring about a sea-change in how media is produced , " he said .
" the bbc has been criticised for its regional coverage but with decent speeds people in those areas could upload their own video clips , " he said .

the telecoms firm is offering fibre to the home to 300 newly built homes in ebbsfleet , kent .
speeds will start at 2.5mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- with " bursts " of 100mbps and the service could be free to consumers on the trial .
" these speeds make it the slowest fibre service in europe " , said jupiter research analyst ian fogg .
" i am surprised .
this is a trial and i see no reason why they are n't trialling the highest speed the technology can deliver .
what is the point of a trial if you do n't really test things ? " he said .
but a bt spokesman said that the speeds would be " very decent " .
" higher in fact that anyone currently needs , " he added .
bt pointed out that while 10mbps would be a baseline minumum for customers , download speeds would increase depending on what the user was doing , such as downloading a movie .
and while the capacity is shared , customers would still get speeds of more than 50mbps when required , said bt .
it is also hoping to offer the service free for the first two years to all the 10,000 homes which will eventually be built at ebbsfleet , in a bid to kick-start next-generation broadband .
this plan has yet to be approved by ofcom .
conservative company bt 's fibre trial options 2.5mbps download speed / 0.5mbps upload speed 10mbps down / 2mbps up 10mbps down / 2mbps up , burst to 30mbps for downloads 10mbps down / 2mbps up , burst to 100mbps source : bt wholesale the uk has been criticised for its slow adoption of super-fast broadband .
cable provider virgin media is currently the only company offering speeds of up to 50mbps - albeit a trial - while some other isps are rolling out service offering speeds up to 24mbps .
bt pointed out network capacity using fibre affect all services across europe .
virgin customers with 20mbps connections have it " throttled back " during certain times of a day .
the longest you can actually run your 20mbps package at " top speed " before the throttles apply is seven minutes , said a bt spokesman .
in europe a handful of operators are offering download speeds of between 20 and 100mbps , with most also offering very fast upload speeds as well .
ebbsfleet will have 10,000 homes connected via fibre , although building will not be complete until 2020 .
bt has not yet announced any other new-build sites earmarked for fibre .
part of the reason for bt 's decision to market fibre trial speeds lower than they are techinically capable of could be natural caution .
" bt is historically a conservative company and has a tendency to suggest a lower performance than will be the case , " said andrew ferguson , editor of thinkbroadband , a broadband comparison and news site .
