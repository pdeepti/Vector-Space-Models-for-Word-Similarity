program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .
and the first global man of the global age in the 21st century comes from the united states of america . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .

in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .

pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 04.11.2008 expat democrats set to celebrate , try to mobilize voters in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many americans stayed up until the early hours to see who would win the us election americans living in germany have gotten more involved than ever before in the us election - at least if they ’ re democrats .
but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .
" people can get out their opinions without the big media and corporations distorting it - which is what the american media do best . " lonely republicans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and palin have n't pushed the right buttons with ex-pat voters whereas democrats abroad is an officially recognized party organization , with votes allocated at the democratic national convention in denver , republicans abroad is a leipzig-based club with no institutional connection to the mccain campaign . thus , supporters of john mccain in germany have found it much more difficult to get involved . heather delisle - a conservative and freelance journalist who appears as a presenter on dw-tv - blames a lack of effort by expat republicans . " i do n't see them doing anything at all , " delisle said .
" i 've hard trouble finding another republican anywhere in the country - beside my father , that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's campaign has focussed squarely on americans living in the us being relatively isolated does have some advantages , though .
the dearth of american conservatives in germany has meant that delisle , who grew up in berlin , has been busy appearing on political chat shows , trying to explain to germans why some americans prefer mccain to obama . still , delisle does n't think much of republicans abroad .

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .
organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled . " they are also promoting an election night party in hamburg hosted at the bucerius law school , and an america votes - let 's party event sponsored by the atlantic academy in kaiserslautern . these events are n't only attracting americans , but some germans as well .
democrats abroad 's purcell said he is expecting a number of interested germans to attend , some out of curiosity and some because they are partnered with an american . his own german friends have shown a surprising level of support . " i ca n't tell you how many german friends have emailed me today and wished me luck , " he said .
" i ca n't imagine that i would have done that for them during the german elections .

stuck on the bench at bayern munich , german international striker lukas podolski said he dreams of better days of scoring goals to adoring fans at his old club cologne .
poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .

" you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .

" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 . " we are not concerned with this topic , " insisted rummenigge .
" lukas has a contract with us until 2010 and we will stick to that .
my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .
and the first global man of the global age in the 21st century comes from the united states of america . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 unprecendented voter turnout in us election as first polls close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters started early in what many see as the most important election in recent memory several battleground states were witnessing " unprecedented " voter turnout tuesday , nov .
7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted .

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too .

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer .

in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .

many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .

he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .

for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .

poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .

" you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .

" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 . " we are not concerned with this topic , " insisted rummenigge .
" lukas has a contract with us until 2010 and we will stick to that .
my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.11.2008 germany 's first gay tv channel hits the airwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign shows like " queer eye for the straight guy " make up much of timmtv germany has a new television channel that loves men .
timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .

" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .

timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .

timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .

" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "

in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 04.11.2008 expat democrats set to celebrate , try to mobilize voters in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many americans stayed up until the early hours to see who would win the us election americans living in germany have gotten more involved than ever before in the us election - at least if they ’ re democrats .
but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .
" people can get out their opinions without the big media and corporations distorting it - which is what the american media do best . " lonely republicans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and palin have n't pushed the right buttons with ex-pat voters whereas democrats abroad is an officially recognized party organization , with votes allocated at the democratic national convention in denver , republicans abroad is a leipzig-based club with no institutional connection to the mccain campaign . thus , supporters of john mccain in germany have found it much more difficult to get involved . heather delisle - a conservative and freelance journalist who appears as a presenter on dw-tv - blames a lack of effort by expat republicans . " i do n't see them doing anything at all , " delisle said .
" i 've hard trouble finding another republican anywhere in the country - beside my father , that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's campaign has focussed squarely on americans living in the us being relatively isolated does have some advantages , though .
the dearth of american conservatives in germany has meant that delisle , who grew up in berlin , has been busy appearing on political chat shows , trying to explain to germans why some americans prefer mccain to obama . still , delisle does n't think much of republicans abroad . " they 're old-school republicans who do n't appeal to young people , and to young women especially , " she said . the chairman of republicans abroad , germany did not response to an e-mail request for an interview . divergent styles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's going to be a long night for supporters of both candidates a glance at the respective web sites of democrats and republican abroad , germany further illustrates their differences . the democratic site features an electoral college scorecard and promises a party throughout the night with live streams , djs and a sunrise breakfast buffet .
the republican page has a quote from president bush and a picture of ronald reagan . but there 's no guarantee that being more dynamic , tech-savvy and better organized abroad can help obama win the presidential election . expat republicans like delisle insist that us voters will defy public opinion surveys and narrowly elect mccain .
the mood among expat democrats is positive , but edgy - with many expressing a similar skepticism about the accuracy of the polls . so the democratic party in berlin could still see obama supporters crying in their beers .
but if they do end up in tears , they can console themselves with the thought that they did everything they could . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .

but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 04.11.2008 expat democrats set to celebrate , try to mobilize voters in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many americans stayed up until the early hours to see who would win the us election americans living in germany have gotten more involved than ever before in the us election - at least if they ’ re democrats .
but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .
" people can get out their opinions without the big media and corporations distorting it - which is what the american media do best . " lonely republicans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and palin have n't pushed the right buttons with ex-pat voters whereas democrats abroad is an officially recognized party organization , with votes allocated at the democratic national convention in denver , republicans abroad is a leipzig-based club with no institutional connection to the mccain campaign . thus , supporters of john mccain in germany have found it much more difficult to get involved . heather delisle - a conservative and freelance journalist who appears as a presenter on dw-tv - blames a lack of effort by expat republicans . " i do n't see them doing anything at all , " delisle said .
" i 've hard trouble finding another republican anywhere in the country - beside my father , that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's campaign has focussed squarely on americans living in the us being relatively isolated does have some advantages , though .
the dearth of american conservatives in germany has meant that delisle , who grew up in berlin , has been busy appearing on political chat shows , trying to explain to germans why some americans prefer mccain to obama . still , delisle does n't think much of republicans abroad . " they 're old-school republicans who do n't appeal to young people , and to young women especially , " she said . the chairman of republicans abroad , germany did not response to an e-mail request for an interview . divergent styles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's going to be a long night for supporters of both candidates a glance at the respective web sites of democrats and republican abroad , germany further illustrates their differences . the democratic site features an electoral college scorecard and promises a party throughout the night with live streams , djs and a sunrise breakfast buffet .
the republican page has a quote from president bush and a picture of ronald reagan . but there 's no guarantee that being more dynamic , tech-savvy and better organized abroad can help obama win the presidential election . expat republicans like delisle insist that us voters will defy public opinion surveys and narrowly elect mccain .
the mood among expat democrats is positive , but edgy - with many expressing a similar skepticism about the accuracy of the polls . so the democratic party in berlin could still see obama supporters crying in their beers .
but if they do end up in tears , they can console themselves with the thought that they did everything they could . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .
it might just be a " change in mood music , " but that can also be important , dyer said .
" it 's very easy to be cynical and say policies in iraq and afghanistan wo n't change " under an obama presidency , dyer said .
but he thinks that obama will continue to impress his european counterparts , even if they do n't always agree with him .

thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .

" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .

the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .
organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled . " they are also promoting an election night party in hamburg hosted at the bucerius law school , and an america votes - let 's party event sponsored by the atlantic academy in kaiserslautern . these events are n't only attracting americans , but some germans as well .
democrats abroad 's purcell said he is expecting a number of interested germans to attend , some out of curiosity and some because they are partnered with an american . his own german friends have shown a surprising level of support . " i ca n't tell you how many german friends have emailed me today and wished me luck , " he said .
" i ca n't imagine that i would have done that for them during the german elections .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .

poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .

" you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .

" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 . " we are not concerned with this topic , " insisted rummenigge .
" lukas has a contract with us until 2010 and we will stick to that .
my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .

" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .

timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .

" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .

" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 foreigners in germany closely following us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us vote has far-reaching implications for the wider world as americans head to the polls tuesday in one of the most closely-watched white house races , dw-world.de spoke with some foreigners living in germany about why the vote matters to them . “ this presidential race is kind of an entertainment show , ” said daniel benitez , a 27-year-old engineer from venezuela who ’ s lived in germany for five years .
" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .
" nearly all of the decisions made in the usa affect the globalized world we live in , " said benitez . courtney tenz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de european press review : obama the better choice the economist is one of the latest influential publications to support democrat barack obama in the us presidential election .
dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 foreigners in germany closely following us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us vote has far-reaching implications for the wider world as americans head to the polls tuesday in one of the most closely-watched white house races , dw-world.de spoke with some foreigners living in germany about why the vote matters to them . “ this presidential race is kind of an entertainment show , ” said daniel benitez , a 27-year-old engineer from venezuela who ’ s lived in germany for five years .
" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .
organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled . " they are also promoting an election night party in hamburg hosted at the bucerius law school , and an america votes - let 's party event sponsored by the atlantic academy in kaiserslautern . these events are n't only attracting americans , but some germans as well .
democrats abroad 's purcell said he is expecting a number of interested germans to attend , some out of curiosity and some because they are partnered with an american . his own german friends have shown a surprising level of support . " i ca n't tell you how many german friends have emailed me today and wished me luck , " he said .
" i ca n't imagine that i would have done that for them during the german elections .

stuck on the bench at bayern munich , german international striker lukas podolski said he dreams of better days of scoring goals to adoring fans at his old club cologne .
poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .

he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .
and the first global man of the global age in the 21st century comes from the united states of america . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .
it might just be a " change in mood music , " but that can also be important , dyer said .
" it 's very easy to be cynical and say policies in iraq and afghanistan wo n't change " under an obama presidency , dyer said .
but he thinks that obama will continue to impress his european counterparts , even if they do n't always agree with him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .
it might just be a " change in mood music , " but that can also be important , dyer said .
" it 's very easy to be cynical and say policies in iraq and afghanistan wo n't change " under an obama presidency , dyer said .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .
organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled . " they are also promoting an election night party in hamburg hosted at the bucerius law school , and an america votes - let 's party event sponsored by the atlantic academy in kaiserslautern . these events are n't only attracting americans , but some germans as well .
democrats abroad 's purcell said he is expecting a number of interested germans to attend , some out of curiosity and some because they are partnered with an american . his own german friends have shown a surprising level of support . " i ca n't tell you how many german friends have emailed me today and wished me luck , " he said .
" i ca n't imagine that i would have done that for them during the german elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 unprecendented voter turnout in us election as first polls close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters started early in what many see as the most important election in recent memory several battleground states were witnessing " unprecedented " voter turnout tuesday , nov .
7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .
the last polls will close in hawaii at 0500 cet and alaska at 0600 cet respectively wednesday . although election results are scheduled to start coming in about 0100 gmt wednesday , western states could also play a big role this year , with results expected to filter in well after 0400 cet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us .

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision .

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .

many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision .

" the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .
the last polls will close in hawaii at 0500 cet and alaska at 0600 cet respectively wednesday . although election results are scheduled to start coming in about 0100 gmt wednesday , western states could also play a big role this year , with results expected to filter in well after 0400 cet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .

the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .
organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled . " they are also promoting an election night party in hamburg hosted at the bucerius law school , and an america votes - let 's party event sponsored by the atlantic academy in kaiserslautern . these events are n't only attracting americans , but some germans as well .
democrats abroad 's purcell said he is expecting a number of interested germans to attend , some out of curiosity and some because they are partnered with an american . his own german friends have shown a surprising level of support . " i ca n't tell you how many german friends have emailed me today and wished me luck , " he said .
" i ca n't imagine that i would have done that for them during the german elections .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .
it might just be a " change in mood music , " but that can also be important , dyer said .
" it 's very easy to be cynical and say policies in iraq and afghanistan wo n't change " under an obama presidency , dyer said .
but he thinks that obama will continue to impress his european counterparts , even if they do n't always agree with him .

polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .

then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .
organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled . " they are also promoting an election night party in hamburg hosted at the bucerius law school , and an america votes - let 's party event sponsored by the atlantic academy in kaiserslautern . these events are n't only attracting americans , but some germans as well .

but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .
" people can get out their opinions without the big media and corporations distorting it - which is what the american media do best . " lonely republicans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and palin have n't pushed the right buttons with ex-pat voters whereas democrats abroad is an officially recognized party organization , with votes allocated at the democratic national convention in denver , republicans abroad is a leipzig-based club with no institutional connection to the mccain campaign . thus , supporters of john mccain in germany have found it much more difficult to get involved . heather delisle - a conservative and freelance journalist who appears as a presenter on dw-tv - blames a lack of effort by expat republicans . " i do n't see them doing anything at all , " delisle said .
" i 've hard trouble finding another republican anywhere in the country - beside my father , that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's campaign has focussed squarely on americans living in the us being relatively isolated does have some advantages , though .
the dearth of american conservatives in germany has meant that delisle , who grew up in berlin , has been busy appearing on political chat shows , trying to explain to germans why some americans prefer mccain to obama . still , delisle does n't think much of republicans abroad . " they 're old-school republicans who do n't appeal to young people , and to young women especially , " she said . the chairman of republicans abroad , germany did not response to an e-mail request for an interview . divergent styles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's going to be a long night for supporters of both candidates a glance at the respective web sites of democrats and republican abroad , germany further illustrates their differences . the democratic site features an electoral college scorecard and promises a party throughout the night with live streams , djs and a sunrise breakfast buffet .
the republican page has a quote from president bush and a picture of ronald reagan . but there 's no guarantee that being more dynamic , tech-savvy and better organized abroad can help obama win the presidential election . expat republicans like delisle insist that us voters will defy public opinion surveys and narrowly elect mccain .
the mood among expat democrats is positive , but edgy - with many expressing a similar skepticism about the accuracy of the polls . so the democratic party in berlin could still see obama supporters crying in their beers .
but if they do end up in tears , they can console themselves with the thought that they did everything they could . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .

an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it .

organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled .

he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .
and the first global man of the global age in the 21st century comes from the united states of america . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 04.11.2008 podolski pines for glory days at fc cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski gets more chances to relax on matchdays than he 'd really like .
stuck on the bench at bayern munich , german international striker lukas podolski said he dreams of better days of scoring goals to adoring fans at his old club cologne .
poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .
this plan did n't work against the defensive minded bielefeld , so podolski came on at half-time .
he set up one goal and then scored another himself , securing victory for his club . yet podolski is still unlikely to start in wednesday 's champions ' league match against fiorentina . a frustrated pine rider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prolific scorer for his country , but not for his club 23-year-old moved to bayern munich from cologne in the summer of 2006 .
after over two seasons , he has n't established himself in the starting 11 , and bayern 's big money signings of fellow strikers klose and toni have n't helped his cause . riding the bench while klose and toni shoot on goal , podolski has said he 's getting fed up . " you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .
bayern munich opened their check book offering 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- and poached cologne 's rising superstar . two years on , cologne 's fortunes have improved .
the side was promoted to the german top flight this season , and after a respectable start cologne could be back in the bundesliga for good . " he dreams of cologne day and night " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has pointed out the podolski problem before podolski 's most outspoken critic , bayern munich general manager uli hoeness said the forward only scores for germany and only against inferior opposition .
hoeness has also claimed that it 's no secret where the player 's heart truly lies . " for him there is only cologne , cologne and cologne , " hoeness said .
" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 . " we are not concerned with this topic , " insisted rummenigge .
" lukas has a contract with us until 2010 and we will stick to that .
my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .
ribery said podolski is an important player who 's still improving , and hopes that he will stay in munich . but fc cologne fans are liable to disagree . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .
" people can get out their opinions without the big media and corporations distorting it - which is what the american media do best . " lonely republicans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and palin have n't pushed the right buttons with ex-pat voters whereas democrats abroad is an officially recognized party organization , with votes allocated at the democratic national convention in denver , republicans abroad is a leipzig-based club with no institutional connection to the mccain campaign . thus , supporters of john mccain in germany have found it much more difficult to get involved . heather delisle - a conservative and freelance journalist who appears as a presenter on dw-tv - blames a lack of effort by expat republicans . " i do n't see them doing anything at all , " delisle said .
" i 've hard trouble finding another republican anywhere in the country - beside my father , that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's campaign has focussed squarely on americans living in the us being relatively isolated does have some advantages , though .
the dearth of american conservatives in germany has meant that delisle , who grew up in berlin , has been busy appearing on political chat shows , trying to explain to germans why some americans prefer mccain to obama . still , delisle does n't think much of republicans abroad . " they 're old-school republicans who do n't appeal to young people , and to young women especially , " she said . the chairman of republicans abroad , germany did not response to an e-mail request for an interview . divergent styles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's going to be a long night for supporters of both candidates a glance at the respective web sites of democrats and republican abroad , germany further illustrates their differences . the democratic site features an electoral college scorecard and promises a party throughout the night with live streams , djs and a sunrise breakfast buffet .
the republican page has a quote from president bush and a picture of ronald reagan . but there 's no guarantee that being more dynamic , tech-savvy and better organized abroad can help obama win the presidential election . expat republicans like delisle insist that us voters will defy public opinion surveys and narrowly elect mccain .
the mood among expat democrats is positive , but edgy - with many expressing a similar skepticism about the accuracy of the polls . so the democratic party in berlin could still see obama supporters crying in their beers .
but if they do end up in tears , they can console themselves with the thought that they did everything they could . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.11.2008 germany 's first gay tv channel hits the airwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign shows like " queer eye for the straight guy " make up much of timmtv germany has a new television channel that loves men .
timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .

" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .

" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuck on the bench at bayern munich , german international striker lukas podolski said he dreams of better days of scoring goals to adoring fans at his old club cologne .
poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .
this plan did n't work against the defensive minded bielefeld , so podolski came on at half-time .
he set up one goal and then scored another himself , securing victory for his club . yet podolski is still unlikely to start in wednesday 's champions ' league match against fiorentina . a frustrated pine rider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prolific scorer for his country , but not for his club 23-year-old moved to bayern munich from cologne in the summer of 2006 .

" you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .
bayern munich opened their check book offering 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- and poached cologne 's rising superstar . two years on , cologne 's fortunes have improved .
the side was promoted to the german top flight this season , and after a respectable start cologne could be back in the bundesliga for good .

hoeness has also claimed that it 's no secret where the player 's heart truly lies . " for him there is only cologne , cologne and cologne , " hoeness said .
" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 . " we are not concerned with this topic , " insisted rummenigge .
" lukas has a contract with us until 2010 and we will stick to that .
my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 foreigners in germany closely following us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us vote has far-reaching implications for the wider world as americans head to the polls tuesday in one of the most closely-watched white house races , dw-world.de spoke with some foreigners living in germany about why the vote matters to them . “ this presidential race is kind of an entertainment show , ” said daniel benitez , a 27-year-old engineer from venezuela who ’ s lived in germany for five years .
" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .
" nearly all of the decisions made in the usa affect the globalized world we live in , " said benitez . courtney tenz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de european press review : obama the better choice the economist is one of the latest influential publications to support democrat barack obama in the us presidential election .
dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours .
-lrb- 03.11.2008 -rrb- fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president .

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.11.2008 germany 's first gay tv channel hits the airwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign shows like " queer eye for the straight guy " make up much of timmtv germany has a new television channel that loves men .
timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .
and the first global man of the global age in the 21st century comes from the united states of america . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .

" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .

pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .

" it 's very easy to be cynical and say policies in iraq and afghanistan wo n't change " under an obama presidency , dyer said .

poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .

" you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .

" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 .

my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .
many of them sent in absentee ballots to their home states weeks ago .
for them , the focus has now moved from the question " who should get my vote " to one that may even be harder to answer : " where should i celebrate ? " " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .
does this conversely diminish the power of europe in representing the west ? this vision that the moment america goes up , europe must go down , is deeply wrong .
it 's not europe versus the united states .
it 's the west trying to improve the situation of the world through positive measures .
in the world in which we live , more than half of humanity lives in asia .
the west exists not against the rest of the world , but as a bearer of certain universal values . what message would obama 's election as the first black us president send to developing countries in africa , asia , and the rest of the world ? it 's a huge message of hope .
for africa , it is a victory against humiliation .
for asia , it 's puzzling to see to see a western nation incarnated by a black or mixed race person , but it demonstrates the openness of the us .
it gives the west an image of modernity by being post-racial and multi-cultural .
and the first global man of the global age in the 21st century comes from the united states of america . interview : diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .
" people can get out their opinions without the big media and corporations distorting it - which is what the american media do best . " lonely republicans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and palin have n't pushed the right buttons with ex-pat voters whereas democrats abroad is an officially recognized party organization , with votes allocated at the democratic national convention in denver , republicans abroad is a leipzig-based club with no institutional connection to the mccain campaign . thus , supporters of john mccain in germany have found it much more difficult to get involved . heather delisle - a conservative and freelance journalist who appears as a presenter on dw-tv - blames a lack of effort by expat republicans . " i do n't see them doing anything at all , " delisle said .
" i 've hard trouble finding another republican anywhere in the country - beside my father , that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's campaign has focussed squarely on americans living in the us being relatively isolated does have some advantages , though .
the dearth of american conservatives in germany has meant that delisle , who grew up in berlin , has been busy appearing on political chat shows , trying to explain to germans why some americans prefer mccain to obama . still , delisle does n't think much of republicans abroad . " they 're old-school republicans who do n't appeal to young people , and to young women especially , " she said . the chairman of republicans abroad , germany did not response to an e-mail request for an interview . divergent styles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's going to be a long night for supporters of both candidates a glance at the respective web sites of democrats and republican abroad , germany further illustrates their differences . the democratic site features an electoral college scorecard and promises a party throughout the night with live streams , djs and a sunrise breakfast buffet .
the republican page has a quote from president bush and a picture of ronald reagan . but there 's no guarantee that being more dynamic , tech-savvy and better organized abroad can help obama win the presidential election . expat republicans like delisle insist that us voters will defy public opinion surveys and narrowly elect mccain .
the mood among expat democrats is positive , but edgy - with many expressing a similar skepticism about the accuracy of the polls . so the democratic party in berlin could still see obama supporters crying in their beers .
but if they do end up in tears , they can console themselves with the thought that they did everything they could . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 04.11.2008 podolski pines for glory days at fc cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski gets more chances to relax on matchdays than he 'd really like .
stuck on the bench at bayern munich , german international striker lukas podolski said he dreams of better days of scoring goals to adoring fans at his old club cologne .
poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .
this plan did n't work against the defensive minded bielefeld , so podolski came on at half-time .
he set up one goal and then scored another himself , securing victory for his club . yet podolski is still unlikely to start in wednesday 's champions ' league match against fiorentina . a frustrated pine rider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prolific scorer for his country , but not for his club 23-year-old moved to bayern munich from cologne in the summer of 2006 .
after over two seasons , he has n't established himself in the starting 11 , and bayern 's big money signings of fellow strikers klose and toni have n't helped his cause . riding the bench while klose and toni shoot on goal , podolski has said he 's getting fed up . " you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .
bayern munich opened their check book offering 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- and poached cologne 's rising superstar . two years on , cologne 's fortunes have improved .
the side was promoted to the german top flight this season , and after a respectable start cologne could be back in the bundesliga for good . " he dreams of cologne day and night " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has pointed out the podolski problem before podolski 's most outspoken critic , bayern munich general manager uli hoeness said the forward only scores for germany and only against inferior opposition .
hoeness has also claimed that it 's no secret where the player 's heart truly lies . " for him there is only cologne , cologne and cologne , " hoeness said .
" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 . " we are not concerned with this topic , " insisted rummenigge .
" lukas has a contract with us until 2010 and we will stick to that .
my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .
ribery said podolski is an important player who 's still improving , and hopes that he will stay in munich . but fc cologne fans are liable to disagree . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de unhappy podolski could leave bayern , says club chairman germany forward lukas podolski could reportedly be allowed to leave bundesliga champions bayern munich , according to munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
-lrb- 02.07.2008 -rrb- podolski out in the cold as bayern stick with star duo just over a year ago , lukas podolski was the poster boy for german soccer .

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .
the last polls will close in hawaii at 0500 cet and alaska at 0600 cet respectively wednesday . although election results are scheduled to start coming in about 0100 gmt wednesday , western states could also play a big role this year , with results expected to filter in well after 0400 cet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .
the last polls will close in hawaii at 0500 cet and alaska at 0600 cet respectively wednesday . although election results are scheduled to start coming in about 0100 gmt wednesday , western states could also play a big role this year , with results expected to filter in well after 0400 cet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .

americans in germany are buzzing about where best to watch the election-night returns .
public parties have been organized across the country , but latecomers beware : many venues sold out long ago . a light is finally shining at the end of a seemingly endless us election tunnel .
people are ready to stop worrying and celebrate - regardless of who winds up getting the ultimate nod from us voters . in germany , election parties are not likely to get really exciting until long after midnight , with the earliest official results due in around 1 a.m.
wednesday local time .
it will be 5 a.m. when the polls finally close on the us west coast . but the time difference has n't taken any edge off the excitement over the historic choice between barack obama , the democratic candidate , and john mccain , the republican contender . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new hampshire voters are first to officially hit the polls the us embassy in berlin estimates that 100,000 us nationals living in germany qualify to vote .

" " party hopping " expected the fact that many people have to get up and go to work early the following morning is just a minor detail to be dealt with , organizers say . " i expect there will be a lot of party hopping , " said matthias bolhoefer , spokesman for private german television station rtl . rtl has joined with german news channel n-tv , cnn , the american academy in berlin , and the american embassy to throw a star-studded party with live broadcasts - including feeds beamed in from times square in new york - from the headquarters of the bertelsmann foundation in berlin . the colors of the us flag will be projected on the building and mock voting papers will be handed out to guests .
round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .
it might just be a " change in mood music , " but that can also be important , dyer said .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .
it might just be a " change in mood music , " but that can also be important , dyer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 unprecendented voter turnout in us election as first polls close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters started early in what many see as the most important election in recent memory several battleground states were witnessing " unprecedented " voter turnout tuesday , nov .
7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .
the last polls will close in hawaii at 0500 cet and alaska at 0600 cet respectively wednesday . although election results are scheduled to start coming in about 0100 gmt wednesday , western states could also play a big role this year , with results expected to filter in well after 0400 cet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .
the last polls will close in hawaii at 0500 cet and alaska at 0600 cet respectively wednesday . although election results are scheduled to start coming in about 0100 gmt wednesday , western states could also play a big role this year , with results expected to filter in well after 0400 cet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 unprecendented voter turnout in us election as first polls close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters started early in what many see as the most important election in recent memory several battleground states were witnessing " unprecedented " voter turnout tuesday , nov .
7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .
his running mate joe biden voted moments later in wilmington , delaware . bildunterschrift : barack obama was still working crowds as polls opened across the country mccain voted in phoenix before flying to colorado , while his vice-presidential candidate sarah palin went home to alaska to vote and said she felt " optimistic and confident . " " i hope , i pray , i believe i 'll be able to wake up as vice- presidential elect and work in transition mode with john mccain ... it 's great to be home because forever i 'll be sarah from alaska , " palin told reporters . an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 51.9 per cent to mccain 's 44.4 per cent on tuesday . but in the state-by-state , winner-takes-all us system , presidential campaigns focus on key battleground states , and mccain was still hoping to pull off an upset victory by winning in states like florida , ohio and pennsylvania . millions already took to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada . more than 31.9 million people voted early , according to professor michael mcdonald , who runs the us elections project at george mason university , virginia .
this was 25.1 per cent of the total vote in the 2004 elections . an estimated 140 million people are expected to vote tuesday , up from 121 million in 2004 . clintons look ahead to hopeful democratic victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton arrived late on the obama support trail former president bill clinton and his wife hillary - who lost out on the race to the white house - voted in chappaqua , new york .
" it 's really for me a tremendous opportunity and honor to be part of what i hope will be a great couple of years for america , " she said . voters waited patiently in serpentine queues early tuesday to cast ballots .
many had started lining up before dawn ; some braved pouring rain to cast their ballot . in washington , the capital where more than half of residents are african american and where democratic presidential candidates historically easily prevail , voters were expected to endorse obama 's message of change . fred owens , an african american standing outside hine junior high school in the city 's southeast district , said he voted for obama because " we need a change , " and downplayed the role of race in his decision . " i would n't really say it has anything to do with black , " owens said , adding that mccain did n't have a clear plan of the direction he wanted to lead to nation .
" mccain sounds fake to me , " he said . paul taylor , a 29-year-old african american student in chicago said he voted for obama , but race was not an issue for him .
" to support somebody because of their pigment is superficial , " he said . in miami 's cuban-american community , which traditionally prefers republicans for their hard-line stance toward havana , carmela rivera , a black cuban-american , smiled as she showed off a republican badge and photograph of mccain . " i suffered a lot in cuba .
i do no want to relive what i went through there , " rivera said . battleground states there for the taking bildunterschrift : results in some of the most important states are still proving to hard to call in virginia , another battleground state which has not gone into the democratic column since 1964 but where polls were showing obama with a slight lead , some republicans were worried the state was slipping away . " i think it will be closer , but it 's pretty clear what the outcome 's going to be , " conceded meredith ellsworth , a 57-year-old arlington , virginia resident out volunteering for mccain . according to tradition , voting began at the stroke of midnight tuesday in a handful of remote towns in the north-eastern state of new hampshire .
the residents of dixville notch have been meeting in the town 's ballot room at midnight each election day since 1960 . obama won the town 's poll by 15 votes to six for mccain , in a departure from 40 years of republican loyalty . all states - except for alaska and hawaii - opened at various times till 10 am -lrb- 1600 central european time -rrb- .
the last polls will close in hawaii at 0500 cet and alaska at 0600 cet respectively wednesday . although election results are scheduled to start coming in about 0100 gmt wednesday , western states could also play a big role this year , with results expected to filter in well after 0400 cet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 for the us presidential election , officials said , with initial fears of a procedural meltdown so far proving largely unfounded . despite the high turnout - expected to reach records in several states amid massive campaign efforts to register new voters - problems were minor in florida , missouri , ohio and virginia , states that republican john mccain and his democratic rival barack obama have fought over tooth and nail in weeks leading up to election day . in missouri , a bellwether state which has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1904 with just one exception , officials were seeing a massive voter response . " we do have unprecedented turnout , " laura egerdal , communications director for missouri 's secretary of state , told reporters , noting that long lines were seen in scores of precincts . " i think today we are easily going to set a record for the sheer number of voters turning out today , " she said , adding that the state could also surpass the record 78 percent turnout seen back in 1992 . the state added 342,000 new first-time voters to its rolls in 2008 , comprising more than eight percent of missouri voters , egerdal said . early morning voting in kansas city was marred by the misplacement of voting books in some precincts , which delayed poll openings , but egerdal said the problem was remedied .
lines were common in virginia , too . " it 's a phenomenal turnout , " virginia 's secretary of state jean jensen told a news briefing , noting that up to 40 percent of the state 's registered voters had cast their ballots by 10:00 am . " some -lrb- precinct officials -rrb- said 50 percent of virginians who are eligible to vote have already been to the polls . " the traditionally red , or republican , state of virginia has been under assault by obama and his campaign , who see wresting it away from republicans as a key to victory . jensen noted there had been several minor problems reported to authorities , including two polling stations opening late due to human error , the malfunction of some optical scanning machines , and allegations of voter suppression and intimidation , including advocacy groups " being overzealous in their outreach . " record turnout was expected in north carolina - where some polls call the race a virtual tie - despite a steady rain falling across the southeastern state . " i feel certain we 're going to exceed 70 percent voter turnout , " breaking the state record 69 percent in 1984 , said johnnie mclean , deputy director of north carolina 's board of elections . " we have had lots of new voter registrations , record-breaking absentee voting " and huge early voting turnout in the two weeks prior to election day , mclean said . the hard-fought swing state of ohio was on track for an 80-percent voter turnout , according to the secretary of state 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of problems at the polls have been trickling in jeff ortega , of ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner 's office , said brunner 's preparations for high numbers of voters helped minimize election day problems and keep voter lines down to manageable levels , although some polling stations saw lines of an hour or longer . " it looks like those efforts bore fruit , " ortega said . but election protection website 866ourvote.com did report receiving reports of ohio voters being " inexplicably dropped " from lists of registered voters - an issue that had dogged the 2004 election . a realclearpolitics.com poll average shows obama leading mccain in ohio by 2.5 percent on tuesday in ohio , which is considered a must win for mccain . the last person to win the presidency without winning ohio was john f. kennedy in 1960 .
in 2004 , bush won ohio by only 118,000 individual votes . in florida , scene of an election day debacle four years ago that led to a controversial recount , election officials reported no major incidents or problems in miami dade and broward counties . but there were news reports of voting machines breaking down and needing replacement in two sarasota precincts . candidates campaigning to the wire meanwhile mccain and obama were makeing their final pushes for votes in key battleground states . mccain campaigned in colorado where he claimed he had regained momentum and expressed confidence that he would defeat obama when all the ballots are counted . " i feel momentum , " mccain said in one of his final rallies in grand junction , before polling stations close tuesday evening .
" we are going to win this election , we are going to win it right here in colorado . " mccain has campaigned aggressively in the last days of the election in states like colorado , pennsylvania , florida and indiana , where polls have shown that the race is tightening .
he was expected to fly back to his home state arizona to wait for the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and his wife cat their votes in phoenix , arizona obama held his final campaign rally monday night in manassas , virginia , another battleground state , and was in indiana tuesday to meet with voters .
in the evening he will be back at his campaign headquarters in chicago to watch ballot returns . officials were prepared for an unprecedented turnout as voters delivered their verdict on democrat barack obama , 47 , and his republican rival john mccain , 72 , after the longest and most expensive campaign in us history . democrats are hopeful that eight years of president george w bush 's unpopular policies in iraq and the slumping economy will persuade voters to hand them control of the white house and strengthen their control of congress . if elected , obama would be the first african american president in us history .
if mccain wins , he will be the oldest president ever to begin his first term . it was a bittersweet end to the 21-month campaign for obama : his grandmother madelyn dunham , 86 , passed away after a battle with cancer , the illinois senator revealed monday . candidates join the throng to cast votes obama returned to chicago , the city where his rise to prominence began , to cast his vote .

he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .
the second is a landslide for obama .
but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .
burden-sharing in terms of military and economic help , so america will turn to the rest of the world , in particular to her european allies , for help .
obama will say , " well , you voted for me .
i 'm glad , and i need you .
now what can you do for me ? " you mean the us asking for more combat troops in the dangerous southern part of afghanistan to fight taliban insurgents , for example … these -lrb- are the sorts of -rrb- problems that would be even more troubling with obama as president .
there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .

" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”

“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?

obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .

but that has n't stopped the media from hyping the election to an unprecedented level . berlin is six hours ahead of new york .
that means it will be a long night for germans who ca n't go to bed without knowing whether republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will be the next president of the united states .
thomas greven is one of those expecting to pull an all-nighter on tuesday . the german media 's obsession with the us presidential election has reached such a fevered pitch that even level-headed political scientists are staying up past their bedtimes .
" this is the fourth interview i 'm giving today .
it 's a media frenzy , " said greven , a visiting professor at the john f. kennedy institute in berlin , who is on call to give a play-by-play analysis for german media outlets into the wee hours of the morning .
yet greven and other political scientists warn that germans who have fallen head over heels for obama are setting themselves up for heartbreak , even if their candidate wins .
" there 's bound to be disappointment on all fronts , " greven said .
a reality check obama is favored to win going into tuesday 's voting .
in the final pre-election gallup-usa today poll published monday , obama was leading his republican opponent john mccain by 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
yet with an unprecedented 135 million people expected to cast ballots , the vote could end up being close in crucial states such as ohio and florida .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us election officials expect record turnouts in the german public opinion , obama has already won by a landslide .
polls show that nearly three out of every four germans would like to see obama win and he has similar support across europe .
the german media have showered adoration on the telegenic obama , believing he can usher in a new era to transatlantic relations , which have been badly strained during the eight years of president george w bush .
mccain is seen by many europeans not as a self-styled maverick , but as a continuation of bush 's failed policies .
tough going " a lot of people have a lot of big expectations linked to the elections , " said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich .
" if obama wins there will be a lot of smiling faces here -lrb- on wednesday -rrb- and then the big disappointment a quarter of a year later , " he predicted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both candidates will put us interests first europeans ' love for obama is based more on his persona than a long look at his stance on transatlantic relations , bauer said .
and the next us president will inherit an extraordinary set of emergencies that could force him to take some tough decisions .
the next us president will be expected to find solutions to extremely unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan .
he will be expected to take leadership on the global financial crisis which is threatening to pull both the united states and europe into a deep recession .
then there are thorny issues such as us opposition to iran 's desire to build nuclear weapons , the growing strength of al-qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions , russia 's bellicose stance towards its neighbors and turkey 's growing resentment of the us .
germans love to point to obama 's opposition to the war in iraq but conveniently forget that he wants europe to increase troop levels in southern afghanistan , a demand which would be wildly unpopular in germany , bauer said .
obama and mccain have also said they will use military force if necessary against countries such as iran , which europe generally opposes , bauer said .
optimism in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama recently got a rock star greeting in berlin for dominic dyer , the executive director of the london-based american european institute , obama would bring a different tone to discussions with europe .

" it 's very easy to be cynical and say policies in iraq and afghanistan wo n't change " under an obama presidency , dyer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 obama win to transform world 's view of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if elected , barack obama becomes the first black president of the united states of america france 's dominique moisi , one of europe 's leading geo-strategic thinkers , predicts a democratic win on election day .
he told dw an obama victory will restore the us ' reputation as a land of hope and opportunity . dominique moisi , 62 , a founder of the french institute for international relations -lrb- ifri -rrb- in paris and visiting professor at harvard university , is the author of the soon-to-be released book " the geopolitics of emotion : how cultures of fear , humiliation , and hope are reshaping the world . " dw-world.de : democratic candidate barack obama has a comfortable lead in the polls at the moment .
what would it say about the usa , if obama is elected ? dominique moisi : it would say above all that americans are capable of reinventing themselves .
it would say that they felt the need to turn the pages of the past several years , that they -lrb- woke up -rrb- to discover an exceptional man waiting in the wings and seized an opportunity that is rare in history to make this man their president . what do you predict as the outcome of this election ? from the depths of my heart , i would consider two scenarios .
the first is a close victory by obama .

but i exclude , maybe i 'm wrong , the possibility of a surprise mccain victory .
it 's not only that obama has been an exceptionally good -lrb- campaigner -rrb- , but also that mccain ran a very bad campaign , and kept compounding his mistakes . what message would an obama victory send to the rest of the rest of the world ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moisi : america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity the first message is that america , the beacon of hope , is back .
the one country in the world that is carrying a universal message remains america . there are other powers in our multi-polar world : china is important , russia can not be neglected .
but neither of these countries carries a universal message .
only america does .
china wants to be big and is going to be big , but it has rather selfish aims . what makes a difference is that no one in the world dreams of becoming chinese or becoming russian .
but millions of people in the world , even some europeans , still dream of becoming american .
and many more millions will dream of that if and when obama is elected president of the united states , because america will reassert itself as the land of opportunity . what is this universal american message ? it 's the triumph of humanism , the idea that you are on earth in order to improve the human condition . if europeans could vote , obama would win by a landslide .
now it looks as if they ’ re getting what they want .
will europe and america start to love each other now ? well , a certain blatant form of anti-americanism , as practiced in particular by the french , would be much , much more difficult with a president obama . one should be prudent though .
nothing is more dangerous than the realization of your dreams , because you 're bound to be disappointed .
the image of america would be dramatically transformed with the election of obama , but that does n't mean that conflicts between the us and europe will miraculously disappear .
for one , the americans will ask more from the europeans . you mean that the americans will be asking europeans to do more of their fair share in afghanistan , iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama attracted huge crowds on a european tour in july definitely .

there is a huge difference between the symbolism of obama 's -lrb- expected -rrb- victory and the reality of an obama victory .
if he is going in the wrong policy direction , europeans will be disappointed .
but the disillusionment will come from what obama does , not from what obama represents . can obama make a difference , compared to bush and mccain , not because of his policy choices , but simply because of who he is ? yes .
obama , the president immediately changes the world 's image of america and that does make a big difference .
but what i would warn europeans is the following : do n't underestimate the revolutionary symbolic impact of an obama winning the election , but do not overestimate the capabilities of an obama administration to change the world . could it be then that someone like john mccain might in reality better for europe , since expectations are low and some find it easier to be an adversary of a republican president ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's multi-racial family adds to his appeal to some voters a few people are saying that it is in europe 's real interest to have mccain as president , so that you can continue to oppose america , but this cynical vision represents a minority view and does not serve the long term interests of the west . you 've said that if obama becomes president , the reputation of the us would be improved in the eyes of the world .

stuck on the bench at bayern munich , german international striker lukas podolski said he dreams of better days of scoring goals to adoring fans at his old club cologne .
poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .
this plan did n't work against the defensive minded bielefeld , so podolski came on at half-time .
he set up one goal and then scored another himself , securing victory for his club . yet podolski is still unlikely to start in wednesday 's champions ' league match against fiorentina . a frustrated pine rider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prolific scorer for his country , but not for his club 23-year-old moved to bayern munich from cologne in the summer of 2006 .
after over two seasons , he has n't established himself in the starting 11 , and bayern 's big money signings of fellow strikers klose and toni have n't helped his cause . riding the bench while klose and toni shoot on goal , podolski has said he 's getting fed up . " you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .
bayern munich opened their check book offering 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- and poached cologne 's rising superstar . two years on , cologne 's fortunes have improved .
the side was promoted to the german top flight this season , and after a respectable start cologne could be back in the bundesliga for good . " he dreams of cologne day and night " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has pointed out the podolski problem before podolski 's most outspoken critic , bayern munich general manager uli hoeness said the forward only scores for germany and only against inferior opposition .
hoeness has also claimed that it 's no secret where the player 's heart truly lies . " for him there is only cologne , cologne and cologne , " hoeness said .
" he dreams of cologne day and night . " still , the official bayern munich position remain that podolski is not for sale , and that he will play more often if he performs better and scores more goals .
podolski has only netted 10 times in over 2 years in munich compared to a strike rate of 31 goals in 59 games with the national team . club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge explained the team 's position to reporters on tuesday , saying bayern have received no offers for podolski , and that the striker would see out his contract which runs till 2010 . " we are not concerned with this topic , " insisted rummenigge .
" lukas has a contract with us until 2010 and we will stick to that .
my advice to him is : play well , score goals . " high profile teammates like french playmaker franck ribery , have also called on podolski to keep a cool head during his time on the bayern bench .
ribery said podolski is an important player who 's still improving , and hopes that he will stay in munich . but fc cologne fans are liable to disagree . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .

life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 04.11.2008 foreigners in germany closely following us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us vote has far-reaching implications for the wider world as americans head to the polls tuesday in one of the most closely-watched white house races , dw-world.de spoke with some foreigners living in germany about why the vote matters to them . “ this presidential race is kind of an entertainment show , ” said daniel benitez , a 27-year-old engineer from venezuela who ’ s lived in germany for five years .
" i ’ ve been paying more attention to the us elections than to those in venezuela , where i can vote . ”
that 's easy enough to understand .
in recent weeks , europe 's media has reported on every twist and turn of the high-voltage , personality-driven us presidential drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california governor schwarzenegger adds some showbiz power to mccain 's campaign vastly different from its more staid counterparts in europe , the hollywood-style us campaign trail has grabbed headlines in european papers .
and with democrat barack obama poised to make history by being elected america 's first black president - most polls show him leading over republican john mccain - media coverage has reached fever pitch in the past days .
“ every day , in nearly every european paper or television program , there are features on the election , ” said anna ferigo , a native of italy .
“ so i ’ ve been paying a lot more attention than i ’ d planned to . ”
obama the clear favorite all that coverage seems to have created strong opinions among non-americans about who they 'd like to see in the white house .
recent opinion polls from more than 70 nations show people favoring obama with a resounding three-to-one over john mccain .
many believe obama 's international background would go a long way in helping restore america 's image and credibility , badly dented by the us-led war on iraq .
for many who dw-world.de spoke with , their preference for obama was driven by their desire to see the back of president george w bush after eight years in office .
“ i ’ d go for obama for the fairly naive reason that he 's not a republican , ” said karin walker , a british national living in germany “ i 'd be damned if i put my money behind another bush . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama was treated like a rock star when visited berlin in july this year that sentiment was echoed by benitez who said he feared another republican president would simply carry on with the bush administration 's policies .
“ i would vote for barack obama , not because i think that he will save usa or the world , but because i think that mccain would do worse , continuing the political line of bush . ”
" us decisions affect the world " anna ferigo voiced the commonly-held view that expectations were being set too high and that obama would not be able to deliver .
“ i have the impression that obama is watched here in europe as a sort of messiah , ” said ferigo .
“ should obama win , it 's not that magically all the problems which involve the us - and directly or indirectly , europe - will be solved .
but i would be incapable of voting for a candidate who chose sarah palin as his vice president .
impossible . ”
beyond the vehement rhetoric , some of those interviewed said they feared another republican administration would worsen the troubles afflicting america .
“ i fear an era of hyper-conservatism that would restrict civil rights and exacerbate an already growing economic and class divide between the ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have-nots ’ , " says katherine verhagen , a canadian lecturer in the university of bonn ’ s north american studies program . only one person - an iraqi refugee in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous - said he ’ d choose mccain .
“ i ’ m concerned about iran .
what is the us going to do to stop iran ?
talk to ahmadinejad ?
obama 's answer to that just doesn ’ t cut it for me . ”
eventually , regardless of whether obama or mccain win the election , the us vote will have far-reaching implications for the world closely watching it .
" nearly all of the decisions made in the usa affect the globalized world we live in , " said benitez . courtney tenz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poldi said he may even look for a transfer . for his country he 's a goal machine , and a regular feature in the starting lineup , but lukas podolski has rarely had the chance to take the pitch for bayern munich . podolski 's chance looked like it had come over the weekend when italian superstar luca toni was out injured , normally poldi would be the man to step into the breach . but bayern coach juergen klinsmann had other ideas .
playing against a relatively weak bielefeld team , klinsmann elected instead to play miroslav klose as a lone striker and further bolster the midfield .
this plan did n't work against the defensive minded bielefeld , so podolski came on at half-time .
he set up one goal and then scored another himself , securing victory for his club . yet podolski is still unlikely to start in wednesday 's champions ' league match against fiorentina . a frustrated pine rider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prolific scorer for his country , but not for his club 23-year-old moved to bayern munich from cologne in the summer of 2006 .
after over two seasons , he has n't established himself in the starting 11 , and bayern 's big money signings of fellow strikers klose and toni have n't helped his cause . riding the bench while klose and toni shoot on goal , podolski has said he 's getting fed up . " you can understand that i will be considering by the winter break how things are going to continue , " podolski told kicker magazine . podolski started his career in his home town cologne , and quickly became the city 's favorite son by netting 46 goals in 81 games for the club , and for most of that time he was still a teenager . poldi , as he came to be known , was playing so well for club and country - grabbing the " best young player " award at world cup 2006 in germany - that his second division side knew it would n't be able to cling to their talented forward forever .
bayern munich opened their check book offering 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.9 million -rrb- and poached cologne 's rising superstar . two years on , cologne 's fortunes have improved .

round-table talks will take place throughout the night , punctuated by jazz music and fuelled by american snacks . early birds get to celebrate there is a caveat , however : to get in , you must be one of the 700 invited prominent guests . people looking for an open party in berlin had a host of other choices - at least they did if they signed up early .
policy wonks could enjoy a collaborative bash thrown by the amerikahaus together with the institute for cultural diplomacy and the federal agency for civic education , which mixes a program of round table discussions with jazz and cocktails ; the program was nearly sold out early on nov .
4 . the berlin chapter of democrats abroad probably thought they were covering their bases by renting a theatre in the center of the city .
however , all 800 tickets to the event - which promises live bands , food , a surprise movie , and beamed-in results - are sold out . munich bash sold out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ohio , voters took their swing-state role seriously other metropolises had the same problem .
an election-night party organized by democrats abroad in munich 's busching garten restaurant - a venue frequented by americans even in non-election years - was sold out in less than 14 days . " people keep calling and calling for tickets and i just have to tell them there are n't any , " said manfred comploy , who owns the restaurant . comploy said he is glad the organizers asked him to host the party , but not just because he stands to sell a lot of beer . " i believe in this change , " he said .
" we 're doing a lot to make it special .
i think everyone is very anxious to see the outcome of this election , and i 'm glad to be part of it . " bigger crowd than expected comploy said he expects most people will go home sometime around 1:30 a.m. , when some of the eastern states ' results are in . the party hosted by the democrats abroad in north rhine-westphalia is n't sold out because it is free and open to the public . but now they are concerned that the venue they picked expecting a moderate turnout might wind up being too small .
organizer bill purcell said around 15 or 20 people might show up for a typical democrats abroad meeting . " i thought , ' i 'll just quadruple that for the party , " ' explained purcell , who optimistically booked the medium-sized cafe central in downtown cologne . that was before his organization became a sudden darling of the local press in the final days of the election . democrats abroad : media darlings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines for early voting were long " now there are more press coming to the party " than usually come to a meeting , he explained .
he has currently heard from " at least " 100 people from all over the region who plan to attend . " it 's the first time i 've done everything like this , and it took me by surprise , " he said , adding that he hopes the weather stays clear so that the crowds can spill out onto the cafes terrace if needed . even with obama apparently taking a clear lead going into the election , its not only democrats who are planning election events . republicans set to celebrate the german chapters of republicans abroad are organizing their own events , including a " november surprise " election party in berlin , where viewers can " watch mccain / palin come from behind and leave the liberal elite media puzzled . " they are also promoting an election night party in hamburg hosted at the bucerius law school , and an america votes - let 's party event sponsored by the atlantic academy in kaiserslautern . these events are n't only attracting americans , but some germans as well .
democrats abroad 's purcell said he is expecting a number of interested germans to attend , some out of curiosity and some because they are partnered with an american . his own german friends have shown a surprising level of support . " i ca n't tell you how many german friends have emailed me today and wished me luck , " he said .
" i ca n't imagine that i would have done that for them during the german elections .

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 04.11.2008 expat democrats set to celebrate , try to mobilize voters in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many americans stayed up until the early hours to see who would win the us election americans living in germany have gotten more involved than ever before in the us election - at least if they ’ re democrats .
but the hard work doesn ’ t necessarily mean that expat dems will be partying . with barack obama leading all the major pre-election polls , the berlin chapter of democrats abroad is taking over a large movie theater in the city center to stage what they hope will be a historic victory bash . " we 've sent in our ballots already and done all we can do , " michael steltzer , chairman of democrats abroad , berlin , told dw-world.de.
" now we want to party . " the obama campaign has put unprecedented emphasis on expatriate voters , giving democrats living outside the us ample opportunities have their say in the course of the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama revved up supporters in berlin when he visited the german capital this summer obama ' 08 has a professional central european office , and volunteers have been calling all over the continent to ensure that democrats applied for absentee ballots and cast them in time to be counted .
membership in berlin chapter of democrats abroad has doubled in the past year , and old and new recruits are equally enthusiastic . mindful of their disappointment in 2000 and 2004 , they 've even been calling voters in swing states in the us .
the phone numbers are provided by the obama campaign . " the treasurer of our organization told me the experience was really heartening , " steltzer said .
" he called up 15 people in florida , and of the ones he reached , 12 said they had already voted for obama - and only one for mccain . " the expat initiative is an experiment .
no one knows whether it will yield more votes for obama .
but it has given democrats outside the us a common sense of purpose . all in the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voting and participation are expected to hit record levels as is true for expat americans in general , democrats living abroad are a diverse group with varying concerns and motivations .
but one family story perhaps illustrates the obama campaign 's efforts to bring their supporters together . karen axelrad is an architect in her early 60s who 's lived in berlin for 35 years .
she joined democrats abroad in 2004 because she was upset with the iraq war and volunteers her time to do graphics for the organization . she said this time around the ante has been upped . " the whole campaign is entirely different , " axelrad said .
" in 2004 , there was n't much organization from washington , but this year groups around the world took part in a global primary , and there 's a paid staffer outside the us . " one person axelrad was able to win over was her son , florian schiedhelm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family sorrow - obama 's grandmother died one day before the election schiedhelm grew up in berlin and recently returned to the german capital after five years of university in the united states .
his environmentalist convictions initially led him to support hillary clinton , but now he 's been volunteering at the phone banks for obama . " at first i was n't so sure about barack obama , " schiedhelm said .
" but i 've gotten a lot of positive feedback , calling people all over europe . " schiedhelm also said that this election , for him , has been different . " there all this new media going on , " he said .
" people can get out their opinions without the big media and corporations distorting it - which is what the american media do best . " lonely republicans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain and palin have n't pushed the right buttons with ex-pat voters whereas democrats abroad is an officially recognized party organization , with votes allocated at the democratic national convention in denver , republicans abroad is a leipzig-based club with no institutional connection to the mccain campaign . thus , supporters of john mccain in germany have found it much more difficult to get involved . heather delisle - a conservative and freelance journalist who appears as a presenter on dw-tv - blames a lack of effort by expat republicans . " i do n't see them doing anything at all , " delisle said .
" i 've hard trouble finding another republican anywhere in the country - beside my father , that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's campaign has focussed squarely on americans living in the us being relatively isolated does have some advantages , though .
the dearth of american conservatives in germany has meant that delisle , who grew up in berlin , has been busy appearing on political chat shows , trying to explain to germans why some americans prefer mccain to obama . still , delisle does n't think much of republicans abroad . " they 're old-school republicans who do n't appeal to young people , and to young women especially , " she said . the chairman of republicans abroad , germany did not response to an e-mail request for an interview . divergent styles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's going to be a long night for supporters of both candidates a glance at the respective web sites of democrats and republican abroad , germany further illustrates their differences . the democratic site features an electoral college scorecard and promises a party throughout the night with live streams , djs and a sunrise breakfast buffet .
the republican page has a quote from president bush and a picture of ronald reagan . but there 's no guarantee that being more dynamic , tech-savvy and better organized abroad can help obama win the presidential election . expat republicans like delisle insist that us voters will defy public opinion surveys and narrowly elect mccain .
the mood among expat democrats is positive , but edgy - with many expressing a similar skepticism about the accuracy of the polls . so the democratic party in berlin could still see obama supporters crying in their beers .
but if they do end up in tears , they can console themselves with the thought that they did everything they could . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the purpose is to allow the general public to get to know the full life of pope eugenio pacelli -lrb- pius xii -rrb- , " pontifical committee for historical sciences president walter brandmueller , told reporters , monday .
" in part it serves to counter some of the malignant interpretations that try to cast a shadow on the figure of pope pacelli , " he added .
life and times of a pope photographs , items of clothing , gifts and documents on display at the exhibition venue - the braccio carlo magno wing of st peter 's colonnade - chart pius 's life from his 1876 birth in rome into an aristocratic family .
it follows his years as a vatican diplomat , including stints in munich and berlin as a papal nuncio , or ambassador .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatican archives pertaining to pius xii ca n't be opened until 2014 in one letter to his brother francesco , the future pope recounts the 1919 occupation by communist revolutionaries of the nuncio offices in munich .
" on that occasion , pius was threatened with a pistol pointed to his head , " pius biographer andrea tornielli said .
the violence and anti-clericalism that surrounded the establishment of the short-lived bavarian soviet republic in 1919 , is said to have influenced pius ' strong anti-communism leaning - a feature of his papacy which lasted from 1939 to his 1958 death .
exhibition paints pius as a nazi opponent but the exhibition also touches on what the roman catholic church and other supporters of pius say is his opposition to nazism and his efforts to safeguard jews .
these include documents highlighting the then cardinal pacelli 's contribution as vatican secretary of state to the " with burning concern , " the 1937 encyclical issued by his predecessor pius xi in which totalitarianism and anti-semitism are condemned .
transcripts on exhibition include part of pius xii 's papal christmas radio message of 1942 .
current pontiff benedict xvi referred to it when he defended his predecessor 's record in an october mass commemorating the 50th anniversary of pius 's death .
in that " emotional " broadcast , pius made apparent his concern for the mass deportation and murder of the jews , pope benedict said .
the exhibition does not contain vatican archival material on pius ' war-time years that historians say may help clear once and for all the lingering ambiguity surrounding his actions during this period .
last week the vatican said such records would only be made available , at the earliest , by 2014 .
canonization on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is in no hurry to canonize pius xii german-born pope benedict has taken time for " reflection " on whether to authorize pius 's beatification - an important step towards roman catholic sainthood - the vatican said last month .
pius xii 's beatification has been a topic of heated debate between catholics and jews since 1967 when the process was initiated .
last month , shear-yushuv cohen , the grand rabbi of haifa , israel , opposed such an honor for the italian pope , saying pius xii " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
last month , the priest in charge of pius 's case for canonization , father peter gumpel , said benedict was hesitating over the beatification dossier out of concern to maintain " good relations " with jews .
for pius to be canonized , father gumpel must prove the former pope performed a miracle - usually a medical cure with no scientific explanation .
the exhibition , which begins tuesday and runs until jan .
6 at the vatican , will later travel to germany and the us . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.11.2008 germany 's first gay tv channel hits the airwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign shows like " queer eye for the straight guy " make up much of timmtv germany has a new television channel that loves men .
timmtv is the country 's first broadcaster to focus on gay and lesbian programming .
already established in much of europe , gay tv 's taken longer to reach germany . germany 's estimated 3.6 million gay men got a new option on saturday , nov .
1 , when wiling an evening away in front of the tv .
" at timmtv , we do n't see ourselves as representatives of the gay community , " timm executive ingo schmoeke told deutsche welle .
" rather , we try to make them an attractive offer .
it 's up to them whether they watch .
but of course , we do endeavor to cater for all of their different desires , wishes and needs . "
timmtv , the country 's first ever broadcaster to openly target gay men as its main demographic , is aiming to draw in their families and friends as well as lesbians and a few so-called metrosexuals for six hours each evening and possibly around the clock if the station proves profitable .
an original tv channel ?
timmtv 's programming plans do not represent any major changes to germany 's private broadcasting landscape .
essentially , the station , like many private german channels , is relying on popular english language series , dubbed into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmtv is looking to capitalise on a market that most german broadacsters ignore " queer eye for the straight guy , " " absolutely fabulous , " " queer as folk , " " rick and steve , " " the l-word , " and " noah 's arc " are currently the lynchpins of timmtv 's programming , schmoeke said .
" currently about 20 or 30 percent of our shows are produced by us , while the remaining 70 percent or so are acquired material " , schmoeke said .
" but we want to increase our output of original programming over time - that 's the difference between us and many other digital channels . "
but timmtv is also gambling on shows that never came into their own in germany .
" absolutely fabulous , " which was one of the uk 's most popular sitcoms , proved too garish and outrageous for a german audience .
but schmoeke said the situation will be different with timmtv 's target audience .
" ' absolutely fabulous ' had a special sense of humor which does n't represent the german mainstream , but there is an affinity between the humor of ' ab fab ' and the humor of gays , " he said .
" we know for a fact that the gay community loves the show , therefore we simply have to offer it . "
popular demographic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ab fab ' girls are n't everyone 's cup of tea the channel also promises to tackle serious issues , including discrimination faced by muslim gays and the persecution of homosexuals under adolf hitler .
there will also be documentaries on stars and celebrities who make waves in the gay community , such as rupert everett , susan sarandon and liza minnelli .
in the short term though , most of these programs will be produced elsewhere , while the channel simply purchases the rights to broadcast the shows in germany .
while timmtv , which executives had hoped to launch last year , is new to germany , similar channels , like pinktv in france and serbia , gay.tv in italy and canada 's pride tv , have been targeting their programming at homosexuals for years .
" the process of digitalization in tv here is behind countries like britain and the us so for us it was not feasible to have our own channel for such a group until very recently , " schmoeke said .
" we did n't delay the decision to launch based on political or social parameters . "
like its international counterparts , timmtv intends to earn its crust through advertising revenue .
its target audience , primarily young men with disposable income , is a popular with advertisers , which bodes well for the station 's success .
after just a few days of broadcasting , viewing figures are n't yet available , but when they are released it wo n't just be the bosses at timmtv paying close attention . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama pays tribute to his grandmother the town , which has a 60-year tradition of being first in the nation to vote , opened its polls at midnight , with turnout of 100 % .
george w bush won there in 2004 , on his way to re-election .
on the eve of the ballot , republican vice-presidential candidate sarah palin was cleared by an investigator for the alaska personnel board of violating state ethics laws as governor of alaska .
a separate report released last month found that she did abuse her office by allowing her husband and staff to pressure alaska 's top law enforcement official to fire her former brother-in-law .
mrs palin sacked walt monegan , the state public safety commissioner , but denied it was because of his refusal to dismiss her sister 's ex-husband , a state trooper .
tributes to grandmother meanwhile , senator obama said his grandmother , madelyn dunham - who largely raised him as a child - had died aged 86 in hawaii after losing her battle with cancer .
in a joint statement with his half-sister , he described her as " the cornerstone of our family , and a woman of extraordinary accomplishment , strength , and humility " , adding that their debt to her was " beyond measure " .
if victory goes to obama , there will be a lot of tears and a lot of memories , some painful campaign trail : gavin hewitt read gavin 's thoughts in full in pictures : us election countdown guide to us election night senator mccain and his wife cindy issued a statement offering their deepest condolences to mr obama and his family .
at an event in north carolina , mr obama appeared emotional as he spoke of his grandmother , saying she had died peacefully in her sleep with his sister by her side .
later , giving his final speech of a 21-month-long campaign , he told supporters in manassas , virginia , that he had found the long journey to election day both humbling and enriching .
" you have moved me again and again , you have inspired me , sometimes when i am down you 've lifted me up , " he said .
" you 've filled me with new hope for our future and you 've reminded me about what makes america so special . "
a usa today / gallup poll published on monday found likely voters favour mr obama by 11 points over mr mccain , 53-42 % .

john mccain tells supporters " we will win " other national polls indicate mr obama 's lead over his rival is holding steady at between five to 11 percentage points .
but the bbc 's james coomarasamy , in washington , says that while mr obama has held a pretty steady lead for several weeks , a number of factors could undermine the pollsters ' predictions .
among them , he says , are the role the illinois senator 's skin colour may play in voters ' intentions ; whether newly-registered voters will actually vote ; and the palin effect - whether mr mccain 's running mate has energised or alienated republicans .
mccain defiant both camps are keenly aware of the need to get voters out in the states that polls suggest remain in the balance .
mr mccain was to dash through half a dozen states on the marathon campaign 's final day - including florida , tennessee , pennsylvania , indiana , new mexico and nevada - before heading home to arizona .
various polls suggest mr obama has a two- to four-point lead over him in electoral vote-rich florida .
on monday morning , the 72-year-old told a crowd of about 1,100 supporters in tampa , florida : " senator obama is running to spread the wealth , i 'm running to create more wealth . "
mr obama , 47 , spent monday targeting states that four years ago voted republican but where he now has a chance of winning , including virginia and north carolina , which have not backed a democratic hopeful in decades .
both campaigns have thousands of volunteers working flat-out manning phone banks , handing out brochures and knocking on doors ahead of tuesday 's election .
some 130 million americans are expected to vote , in a higher turnout than in any election since 1960 , the bbc 's north america editor justin webb says .
a record 27 million people had already cast absentee or early ballots as of saturday night .

jozef wojciechowski is said to be one of the richest men in poland in recent years , the polish builder has become ubiquitous in europe .
he has been quite thin on the ground in his home country , however - until now .
" we lost so many of our skilled people , " says jozef wojciechowski , chairman of the board of jw construction , one of poland 's biggest building enterprises , specialising in luxury apartment blocks and high-end building conversions .
" those people left the country , going after the money .
it was an incredible loss for poland and the economy .
we heard about the slowdown in other countries , so we see some people coming back and we are waiting for them .
" they are very important to us .
skilled builders are hard to find .
when you hear what is going on in the construction industry all over the world at the moment , i think the prospects for poland now are pretty good , " mr wojciechowski says .
' blueprint for success ' the chairman is settled deep in a leather armchair in front of an ornate fireplace in an oak-panelled office in a vast concrete block on the outskirts of warsaw , which is his company 's headquarters .
many poles do not plan to stay much longer on london 's streets everything about his ostentatious setting advertises wealth .
his staff tell me , in awed tones , that he is one of the richest men in poland .
and i have the distinct impression that , as poland 's economy continues to defy the global trend , he is something of a blueprint for success .
it seems an odd time to be talking of business and economic success .

jozef wojciechowski is said to be one of the richest men in poland in recent years , the polish builder has become ubiquitous in europe .
he has been quite thin on the ground in his home country , however - until now .
" we lost so many of our skilled people , " says jozef wojciechowski , chairman of the board of jw construction , one of poland 's biggest building enterprises , specialising in luxury apartment blocks and high-end building conversions .
" those people left the country , going after the money .
it was an incredible loss for poland and the economy .
we heard about the slowdown in other countries , so we see some people coming back and we are waiting for them .
" they are very important to us .
skilled builders are hard to find .
when you hear what is going on in the construction industry all over the world at the moment , i think the prospects for poland now are pretty good , " mr wojciechowski says .

the agreements are set to triple the number of weekly direct passenger flights and allow cargo shipments between ports in china and taiwan .
they also aim to improve the postal service and food safety .
china claims sovereignty over taiwan though they have been separately governed since 1949 .
the agreements were announced on the second day of a five-day visit to taiwan by chen yunlin , china 's top official for handling relations with taiwan .
previously , sovereignty issues involving vessels and crews forced costly detours through third countries , while china-taiwan flights were forced to stop in hong kong or macau .
under the agreements : direct charter flights will increase from 36 to 108 , and can operate daily rather than four days out of seven routes will be shortened and private business jet flights will be allowed direct cargo shipments will be allowed between 11 taiwan sea ports and 63 in china , tax free sixty direct cargo flights will be allowed per month direct postal links will be expanded to improve delivery time , currently up to 10 days food safety alerts between the countries will be set up .
taiwan has the diplomatic recognition of a handful of states .
but since mao zedong 's communists won the chinese civil war and the defeated kuomintang fled to taiwan , china has regarded it as a breakaway province which it has threatened to reunify using force .
taipei protests the latest trade agreements come after the two sides held their first , high-level meeting in a decade in june this year , in beijing .
the improvement in relations follows the election of president ma ying-jeou in taiwan .
viewpoints : china-taiwan deal however , mr ma 's overtures of ending decades of political rivalry with beijing have sparked fierce protests in taiwan , including accusations that he is " selling out " to the mainland .
pro-independence groups staged small protests around taipei to coincide with mr chen 's visit , waving flags and banners .
thousands of police were deployed to ensure mr chen 's safety , after his deputy zhang mingqing was jostled and knocked to the ground by protesters during a visit to taiwan in october .

the agreements are set to triple the number of weekly direct passenger flights and allow cargo shipments between ports in china and taiwan .
they also aim to improve the postal service and food safety .
china claims sovereignty over taiwan though they have been separately governed since 1949 .
the agreements were announced on the second day of a five-day visit to taiwan by chen yunlin , china 's top official for handling relations with taiwan .
previously , sovereignty issues involving vessels and crews forced costly detours through third countries , while china-taiwan flights were forced to stop in hong kong or macau .
under the agreements : direct charter flights will increase from 36 to 108 , and can operate daily rather than four days out of seven routes will be shortened and private business jet flights will be allowed direct cargo shipments will be allowed between 11 taiwan sea ports and 63 in china , tax free sixty direct cargo flights will be allowed per month direct postal links will be expanded to improve delivery time , currently up to 10 days food safety alerts between the countries will be set up .
taiwan has the diplomatic recognition of a handful of states .
but since mao zedong 's communists won the chinese civil war and the defeated kuomintang fled to taiwan , china has regarded it as a breakaway province which it has threatened to reunify using force .
taipei protests the latest trade agreements come after the two sides held their first , high-level meeting in a decade in june this year , in beijing .
the improvement in relations follows the election of president ma ying-jeou in taiwan .
viewpoints : china-taiwan deal however , mr ma 's overtures of ending decades of political rivalry with beijing have sparked fierce protests in taiwan , including accusations that he is " selling out " to the mainland .
pro-independence groups staged small protests around taipei to coincide with mr chen 's visit , waving flags and banners .

he was aged just 48 , and their three children were still growing up .
the drugs that could make a difference in prolonging his life were not funded by the nhs .
people are currently excluded from the nhs if they pay for treatment not available on the health service , but practice varies from place to place .
it was an especially difficult issue for susan and her husband , as both were doctors who had devoted their working lives to the health service .

susan kiernan dr mayer 's posthumous bmj piece she said : " professionally i haven ’ t had to deal with patients in a similar situation , by supporting them in appeals to the primary care trust .

" i used to cherish it so much .

value of life robert mayer wrote an article in the british medical journal , titled " because i ’ m worth it " , in which he pondered the value of his life .
dr mayer with his sons he viewed the rules on top-ups as ludicrous , and enrolled in a drug company trial to get the treatment .
although it can not be quantified exactly , susan believes the drugs gave her husband an extra nine months of life .
she said : " we were warned the side-effects could be pretty ghastly , but in fact robert was pretty well .
" he managed to keep all his hair , which was very important to him , and he did n't lose much weight .
" to all intents and purposes , i don ’ t think you would have noticed this was a man dying of cancer . "

susan kiernan robert died in march this year , 14 months after learning he had cancer .
the couple 's youngest child , angus , 14 , also has strong memories of those last months .
he said : " we both shared a similar interest in music and after the diagnosis , he took me to glastonbury festival .
" it was a really nice thing to have done .
it was a chance to forget everything and enjoy ourselves .
" i could always overhear the conversations with my mum , about the drugs and the money implications .
" it was kind of a constant presence through the household .
" but there were still nice memories of just the whole family together .

fears over division susan is now back at work as a gp in a busy north london surgery .
she shares the unease voiced by many people in the nhs , that allowing top-up payments could lead to divisive situations .

that is because only a little more than half of eligible voters actually turn up at the polls - a percentage that only rose modestly despite the keenly contested presidential election in 2004 .
in the 2004 presidential election , the republicans won the battle by mobilising more of their supporters than the democrats .
see turnout in us presidential elections since 1960 this time , the obama campaign is determined to get out its vote and is pulling out all the stops .
the mccain campaign is hoping that the nomination of sarah palin will help mobilise the christian conservatives who were so important in 2004 .
the ground war the democrats have heavily invested in the " ground war " in key states , setting up local campaign offices in every county in states like ohio , florida and virginia since the end of the primary season .
barack obama has generated enthusiasm among young people other groups supporting the democrats , such as trade unions , are also spending millions in order to get out their vote ; funding telephone and door-to-door canvassing and targeted advertising campaigns .
they are also adopting republican tactics by targeting different groups of voters with different messages through tactics such as direct mail and targeted video messages .
and there is already some evidence that this year the democrats are reaching more of their supporters than the republicans .
according to professor sunshine hillygus of harvard university , the democrats are outpacing the republicans in both traditional and new methods of outreach .
john mccain is hoping sarah palin will help mobilise evangelical christians but she says that , with the economy such a dominant issue , the republicans are having more difficulty in targeting their supporters with " dog whistle issues " that are only mentioned below the surface of the national campaign , such as abortion .
recent polling by the democracy corps suggests that three times as many people have been contacted door-to-door by democrats than republicans -lrb- 21 % to 6 % -rrb- , one-third more have received phone calls -lrb- 35 % to 24 % -rrb- and twice as many have received campaign emails -lrb- 26 % to 12 % -rrb- .
in addition , one quarter of democrats have watched campaign commercials or videos online , compared to one in eight republicans .
differential turnout the democrats need to increase their turnout because many of their key supporters are generally less likely to vote .
there are big differences in turnout among key groups in us - with the better educated , richer and older people generally turning out in greater numbers .
for example , mr obama is running strongly among young people , but in the last presidential election only 46 % of 18-24 year-olds voted , compared to 72 % of those over 55 .
so the under-35s made up 30 % of the potential electorate , but only 25 % of actual voters , while the over-55s were 31 % of the electorate , but 35 % of actual voters .
similarly , white voters were more likely to turn-out to vote , with 67 % voting .
only 60 % of blacks went to the polls , 47 % of hispanics , and 44 % of asians .
and people on lower incomes are also much less likely to vote , with only 46 % of those near the poverty line with family income of $ 20,000 or less turning out , compared to 81 % of those earning over $ 100,000 per year .
mr obama does enjoy one advantage - he is running ahead in the polls among college-educated voters , who are one of the groups who are much more likely to vote .
in fact the differential voting effect of education is even steeper than income or age .
so , for example , young people in college are almost as likely to vote as others with a college education .
one of the leading experts in turnout , curtis gans of the center for the study of the american electorate , says that " this year , higher turnout will almost certainly benefit obama and the democrats . "
however , he says that turnout among young people is unlikely to rise substantially .
early voting this year the democrats are making a big effort to encourage people to vote early , and with 32 states allowing it , estimates suggest that up to 30 % of voters will have cast their ballots before election day , up from 22 % last time .
millions of new voters have registered across the us in the run-up to the vote the latest pew opinion poll , carried out in the last full week of campaigning , suggests that the democrats enjoyed a 19 % lead -lrb- 53 % to 34 % -rrb- among early voters .
many early voters were hoping to avoid the problems of long queues and potential chaos at polling booths in swing states .
the evidence also suggests that the democrats have also succeeded in the drive to register more of their supporters this year , with new registrations running more than two to one democratic in states where party affiliation is recorded .
this is just as important as election day get-out-the-vote efforts .
while around 15 % of registered voters fail to get to the polling booth , nearly of 25 % of eligible citizens are not even registered to vote , according to the us census bureau .
and there is a similar difference in voter registration .

that is because only a little more than half of eligible voters actually turn up at the polls - a percentage that only rose modestly despite the keenly contested presidential election in 2004 .
in the 2004 presidential election , the republicans won the battle by mobilising more of their supporters than the democrats .
see turnout in us presidential elections since 1960 this time , the obama campaign is determined to get out its vote and is pulling out all the stops .
the mccain campaign is hoping that the nomination of sarah palin will help mobilise the christian conservatives who were so important in 2004 .
the ground war the democrats have heavily invested in the " ground war " in key states , setting up local campaign offices in every county in states like ohio , florida and virginia since the end of the primary season .
barack obama has generated enthusiasm among young people other groups supporting the democrats , such as trade unions , are also spending millions in order to get out their vote ; funding telephone and door-to-door canvassing and targeted advertising campaigns .
they are also adopting republican tactics by targeting different groups of voters with different messages through tactics such as direct mail and targeted video messages .
and there is already some evidence that this year the democrats are reaching more of their supporters than the republicans .
according to professor sunshine hillygus of harvard university , the democrats are outpacing the republicans in both traditional and new methods of outreach .
john mccain is hoping sarah palin will help mobilise evangelical christians but she says that , with the economy such a dominant issue , the republicans are having more difficulty in targeting their supporters with " dog whistle issues " that are only mentioned below the surface of the national campaign , such as abortion .
recent polling by the democracy corps suggests that three times as many people have been contacted door-to-door by democrats than republicans -lrb- 21 % to 6 % -rrb- , one-third more have received phone calls -lrb- 35 % to 24 % -rrb- and twice as many have received campaign emails -lrb- 26 % to 12 % -rrb- .
in addition , one quarter of democrats have watched campaign commercials or videos online , compared to one in eight republicans .
differential turnout the democrats need to increase their turnout because many of their key supporters are generally less likely to vote .
there are big differences in turnout among key groups in us - with the better educated , richer and older people generally turning out in greater numbers .
for example , mr obama is running strongly among young people , but in the last presidential election only 46 % of 18-24 year-olds voted , compared to 72 % of those over 55 .
so the under-35s made up 30 % of the potential electorate , but only 25 % of actual voters , while the over-55s were 31 % of the electorate , but 35 % of actual voters .
similarly , white voters were more likely to turn-out to vote , with 67 % voting .
only 60 % of blacks went to the polls , 47 % of hispanics , and 44 % of asians .
and people on lower incomes are also much less likely to vote , with only 46 % of those near the poverty line with family income of $ 20,000 or less turning out , compared to 81 % of those earning over $ 100,000 per year .
mr obama does enjoy one advantage - he is running ahead in the polls among college-educated voters , who are one of the groups who are much more likely to vote .
in fact the differential voting effect of education is even steeper than income or age .
so , for example , young people in college are almost as likely to vote as others with a college education .

in a report for the institute of welsh affairs , will hutton also suggests a transport for wales body to bring more private money to buses and trains .
he argues the organisation could then borrow money against revenue from the smart cards and use this to invest .
the welsh assembly government said it was already rolling out smart cards which could be adapted if required .
in the report , unpacking the progressive consensus , mr hutton argues the assembly government takes too restrictive a view of using private money to improve public services .
private finance " why should n't a transport for wales collect the fares and , like transport for london , have borrowing capacity against that publicly owned , but independently gathered , revenue base ?
" we would have a non-state institution that would drive a coach and horses through rhodri morgan 's progressive consensus , " he writes .
he argues that the need for increased investment in health and education means more private finance schemes will be needed .
" in turn this means that wales will have no alternative but to start a debate on the private finance initiative .
to think otherwise will be to behave like king canute in face of the rising tide . "
mr hutton is the chief executive of the work foundation and a former economics correspondent on the bbc 's newsnight programme .
a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said : " we are rolling out our smartcard scheme across wales and are actively looking at ways in which this can be developed further .
" the technology exists for this to be turned into a version of the oyster card if we want to go down that route in due course . "
the labour am for merthyr tydfil huw lewis has previously called for assembly powers to regulate buses and base it on the london model , which could eventually lead to a wales-wide oyster card .
the report is being launched in association with cardiff university 's wales governance centre .

robert mayer died on 21 march 2008 , age 48 .
i 'm listening to you and yours on radio 4 like you do when you have too much time on your hands , and inadequate concentration span for anything purposeful .
the item is about the cost of new cancer drugs and whether or not the nhs can afford it " at a price that we the taxpayer can afford " as the cancer tsar professor mike richards says .
i was diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma four months ago and i have been thinking a lot recently about how much i cost the nhs .
i think what started it was when patricia hewitt -lsb- then health secretary -rsb- said the nhs could not afford any pay rise this year for gps .
i admit to being slightly irked , overpaid as i seem to be .
i realised , of course , that the national economic situation must be serious if even gordon brown now wants a refund on the gp contract to keep the english economy afloat .
am i too pricey ?
so i have started to think about my own costs - now that i am a patient as well as an expensive gp - whether , perhaps i might not be , how shall we say ... a little too pricey now ?
of course cancer does n't come cheaply . "
i could become a completely private patient but apparently i am not allowed to just pay for the drugs " if you look at my medical record -lrb- which you will probably be able to do sometime soon if the nhs it project does n't get its security act together -rrb- you will see that very little has been spent on me up until i got cancer .
a few prescriptions , tonsils and adenoids when i was seven - probably unnecessary by today 's standards - and one haemorrhoid injected .
a few hundred pounds all in .
people generally still seem to believe that they pay for the nhs with their " stamp " or national insurance contributions , although this is nonsense .
funnily enough they hold onto this view even if their only connection with lloyd george was gcse history .
somehow the government like us to maintain this fantasy , but of course the boring reality is that it comes out of general taxation and there is no nhs bank .
how much do i cost ?
with an eye to the future , and because we may not be too far away from this scenario , i have done a few back of the envelope calculations : investigations : colonoscopy : £ 1,000 gastroscopy : £ 600 scans : £ 3,000 ct biopsy -lrb- two -rrb- : £ 1,000 hospital admission with fever and pulmonary embolism : £ 2,000 outpatient appointments -lrb- weekly -rrb- : £ 2,000 -lrb- and running -rrb- subtotal : £ 9,300 ongoing drug costs : tarceva : £ 1,324 a month avastin : £ 300 a month gemcitabine : £ 450 month capecitabine : £ 300 month tinziparin -lrb- to stop blood clots -rrb- : £ 300 month granisetron -lrb- for nausea -rrb- : £ 200 month ongoing : medical monitoring and scans one medical meeting a week medical day unit once a week ct and mri every two months weekly blood tests total = a lot without the medical costs ongoing drug costs alone are £ 2,874 a month or £ 34,488 a year .
so , without too much exaggeration , i am starting to cost the nhs upwards of £ 40 000 per year .
now is this is expensive ?
what dear taxpayer -lrb- as professor richards asks on you and yours -rrb- do you get for £ 40,000 ?
well i may get six to 12 months -lrb- or longer -rrb- of high quality life .

the moral conundrum so defeated me that i opted for the " opt out " of the clinical trial " that must be worth something - but then i forget they have to pay me at the moment if i 'm working or not , though of course that would stop eventually .

i think what started it was when patricia hewitt -lsb- then health secretary -rsb- said the nhs could not afford any pay rise this year for gps .
i admit to being slightly irked , overpaid as i seem to be .
i realised , of course , that the national economic situation must be serious if even gordon brown now wants a refund on the gp contract to keep the english economy afloat .
am i too pricey ?
so i have started to think about my own costs - now that i am a patient as well as an expensive gp - whether , perhaps i might not be , how shall we say ... a little too pricey now ?
of course cancer does n't come cheaply .
i could become a completely private patient but apparently i am not allowed to just pay for the drugs if you look at my medical record -lrb- which you will probably be able to do sometime soon if the nhs it project does n't get its security act together -rrb- you will see that very little has been spent on me up until i got cancer .
a few prescriptions , tonsils and adenoids when i was seven - probably unnecessary by today 's standards - and one haemorrhoid injected .
a few hundred pounds all in .
people generally still seem to believe that they pay for the nhs with their " stamp " or national insurance contributions , although this is nonsense .
funnily enough they hold onto this view even if their only connection with lloyd george was gcse history .
somehow the government like us to maintain this fantasy , but of course the boring reality is that it comes out of general taxation and there is no nhs bank .
how much do i cost ?
with an eye to the future , and because we may not be too far away from this scenario , i have done a few back of the envelope calculations : investigations : colonoscopy : £ 1,000 gastroscopy : £ 600 scans : £ 3,000 ct biopsy -lrb- two -rrb- : £ 1,000 hospital admission with fever and pulmonary embolism : £ 2,000 outpatient appointments -lrb- weekly -rrb- : £ 2,000 -lrb- and running -rrb- subtotal : £ 9,300 ongoing drug costs : tarceva : £ 1,324 a month avastin : £ 300 a month gemcitabine : £ 450 month capecitabine : £ 300 month tinziparin -lrb- to stop blood clots -rrb- : £ 300 month granisetron -lrb- for nausea -rrb- : £ 200 month ongoing : medical monitoring and scans one medical meeting a week medical day unit once a week ct and mri every two months weekly blood tests total = a lot without the medical costs ongoing drug costs alone are £ 2,874 a month or £ 34,488 a year .
so , without too much exaggeration , i am starting to cost the nhs upwards of £ 40 000 per year .
now is this is expensive ?
what dear taxpayer -lrb- as professor richards asks on you and yours -rrb- do you get for £ 40,000 ?
well i may get six to 12 months -lrb- or longer -rrb- of high quality life .
and my family may get me around as a dad and husband .
my friends keep me as a friend too -lrb- how much is this worth ? -rrb-
nice unofficially say £ 20,000- £ 25,000 per qualy -lrb- quality adjusted life year a measure of useful survival -rrb- is the cut off .
at first sight , i am too expensive .
helping others if i go back to work during this time then , of course , the uk economy really starts to see some return on its investment .
i will see patients again and make some of them better .
the moral conundrum so defeated me that i opted for the " opt out " of the clinical trial that must be worth something - but then i forget they have to pay me at the moment if i 'm working or not , though of course that would stop eventually .
paying income tax and national insurance would soon make a dent in the size of my " loan . "
i would pay it off in a year .
but in reality there is no loan .
if there was most people would be bankrupt when they got ill .
that is why we have an nhs .
i am just exploring the real costs that we do n't often think about .
and here it gets interesting .
ineffective treatment the " standard " and depressingly ineffective treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer is the single agent gemcitabine .
nice approved this over five years ago and has not returned to the subject since .
there is a small amount of evidence , but so far only at the " presented in symposia " level , and not formally peer reviewed , which demonstrates a modest but useful survival advantage with the addition of either capecitabine -lrb- oral 5fu -rrb- or tarceva -lrb- very expensive -rrb- .
in my initial conversations with my local oncologist , i was informed that my primary care trust would not fund capecitabine -lrb- gemcap combination -rrb- but we could apply for special consideration .
there was no way they would fund tarceva .
i wondered what form the appeal might take .
it would be to a committee of the primary care trust comprising a public health doctor , a non executive , a few managers , most of whom i probably know personally .
-lrb- is this good or bad for my chances ? -rrb-
the amount of data is restricted to what i already know .
sex is fine for co-payment , delaying death is not so they will be left having to decide " is he worth it ? "
for six or 12 months ?
well , is he ?
i offered to pay to save them the embarrassment .
actually i offered to pay for the capecitabine .
the bill for tarceva made even me wonder if i was worth it .
i could get a swanky motorbike , large plasma screen , and holiday , drive around very fast then retire gracefully to bed - and my family would have some change at the end .
anyway , this is not an option in england .
i could become a completely private patient but apparently i am not allowed to just pay for the drugs - it is unseemly to the principals of the nhs .
this is of course bullshit .
clinical trial as the government knows all too well , an embarrassed frank dobson in the early years of the new labour government had to announce that by and large viagra could only be made available to nhs patients if they paid for it .
so here we have it , sex is fine for co-payment , delaying death is not .
and which principal was this ?
the moral conundrum so defeated me that i opted for the " opt out " of the clinical trial .
now i am getting more drugs than either i or the nhs could afford , all courtesy of roche pharmaceuticals .
of course they hope eventually to expand their market for tarceva and avastin in the way that they have very successfully for herceptin -lrb- should i have bought shares ? -rrb-
all they await is a little patient pressure and an announcement from mrs hewitt to short circuit the nice process .
meanwhile , i continue on the trial , happy in the knowledge that at least to roche , at least for this year , i 'm worth it .

funnily enough they hold onto this view even if their only connection with lloyd george was gcse history .
somehow the government like us to maintain this fantasy , but of course the boring reality is that it comes out of general taxation and there is no nhs bank .
how much do i cost ?
with an eye to the future , and because we may not be too far away from this scenario , i have done a few back of the envelope calculations : investigations : colonoscopy : £ 1,000 gastroscopy : £ 600 scans : £ 3,000 ct biopsy -lrb- two -rrb- : £ 1,000 hospital admission with fever and pulmonary embolism : £ 2,000 outpatient appointments -lrb- weekly -rrb- : £ 2,000 -lrb- and running -rrb- subtotal : £ 9,300 ongoing drug costs : tarceva : £ 1,324 a month avastin : £ 300 a month gemcitabine : £ 450 month capecitabine : £ 300 month tinziparin -lrb- to stop blood clots -rrb- : £ 300 month granisetron -lrb- for nausea -rrb- : £ 200 month ongoing : medical monitoring and scans one medical meeting a week medical day unit once a week ct and mri every two months weekly blood tests total = a lot without the medical costs ongoing drug costs alone are £ 2,874 a month or £ 34,488 a year .
so , without too much exaggeration , i am starting to cost the nhs upwards of £ 40 000 per year .
now is this is expensive ?
what dear taxpayer -lrb- as professor richards asks on you and yours -rrb- do you get for £ 40,000 ?
well i may get six to 12 months -lrb- or longer -rrb- of high quality life .
and my family may get me around as a dad and husband .
my friends keep me as a friend too -lrb- how much is this worth ? -rrb-
nice unofficially say £ 20,000- £ 25,000 per qualy -lrb- quality adjusted life year a measure of useful survival -rrb- is the cut off .
at first sight , i am too expensive .
helping others if i go back to work during this time then , of course , the uk economy really starts to see some return on its investment .
i will see patients again and make some of them better .
the moral conundrum so defeated me that i opted for the " opt out " of the clinical trial that must be worth something - but then i forget they have to pay me at the moment if i 'm working or not , though of course that would stop eventually .
paying income tax and national insurance would soon make a dent in the size of my " loan . "
i would pay it off in a year .
but in reality there is no loan .
if there was most people would be bankrupt when they got ill .
that is why we have an nhs .
i am just exploring the real costs that we do n't often think about .
and here it gets interesting .
ineffective treatment the " standard " and depressingly ineffective treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer is the single agent gemcitabine .

there is a small amount of evidence , but so far only at the " presented in symposia " level , and not formally peer reviewed , which demonstrates a modest but useful survival advantage with the addition of either capecitabine -lrb- oral 5fu -rrb- or tarceva -lrb- very expensive -rrb- .
in my initial conversations with my local oncologist , i was informed that my primary care trust would not fund capecitabine -lrb- gemcap combination -rrb- but we could apply for special consideration .
there was no way they would fund tarceva .

it would be to a committee of the primary care trust comprising a public health doctor , a non executive , a few managers , most of whom i probably know personally .

actually i offered to pay for the capecitabine .
the bill for tarceva made even me wonder if i was worth it .
i could get a swanky motorbike , large plasma screen , and holiday , drive around very fast then retire gracefully to bed - and my family would have some change at the end .

and which principal was this ?
the moral conundrum so defeated me that i opted for the " opt out " of the clinical trial .
now i am getting more drugs than either i or the nhs could afford , all courtesy of roche pharmaceuticals .
of course they hope eventually to expand their market for tarceva and avastin in the way that they have very successfully for herceptin -lrb- should i have bought shares ? -rrb-
all they await is a little patient pressure and an announcement from mrs hewitt to short circuit the nice process .

the £ 13.5m ysbyty alltwen in tremadog , near porthmadog in gwynedd will not now admit patients until early 2009 .
the north west wales nhs trust said remedial work is needed after the building 's drainage was found not to be installed to a satisfactory standard .
the hospital 's opening has been delayed twice before , from last march and then from august , over the problems .
the nhs trust 's board said the board had decided the work on the drainage underneath the hospital was needed after receiving expert advice .
the hospital 's opening had been rescheduled for next month but the work is likely to take up to 12 weeks .
commissioning process martin jones , the chief executive of the trust , said : " we are very disappointed that the opening of ysbyty alltwen has been further delayed .
" however , the trust does not believe it can accept handover of the hospital while doubts as to the effectiveness of the drainage system remained .
" we have therefore decided that the contractor should be asked to fully rectify the deficiencies before we can accept the construction process as complete and begin the commissioning process before welcoming the first patients through the door , " mr jones added .
an open day is to be held at the hospital for the public to tour the facility before its official opening and the date of that will be publicised soon .
the hospital , which will replace ysbyty bron y garth in penrhyndeudraeth , was given the go-ahead in 2004 after a 15-year campaign .
the 30-bed unit will also have a minor injuries unit and outpatient , x-ray and rehabilitation departments .
there was a delay over the design of the hospital 's roof in 2005 .

the £ 13.5m ysbyty alltwen in tremadog , near porthmadog in gwynedd will not now admit patients until early 2009 .
the north west wales nhs trust said remedial work is needed after the building 's drainage was found not to be installed to a satisfactory standard .
the hospital 's opening has been delayed twice before , from last march and then from august , over the problems .
the nhs trust 's board said the board had decided the work on the drainage underneath the hospital was needed after receiving expert advice .
the hospital 's opening had been rescheduled for next month but the work is likely to take up to 12 weeks .
commissioning process martin jones , the chief executive of the trust , said : " we are very disappointed that the opening of ysbyty alltwen has been further delayed .
" however , the trust does not believe it can accept handover of the hospital while doubts as to the effectiveness of the drainage system remained .
" we have therefore decided that the contractor should be asked to fully rectify the deficiencies before we can accept the construction process as complete and begin the commissioning process before welcoming the first patients through the door , " mr jones added .
an open day is to be held at the hospital for the public to tour the facility before its official opening and the date of that will be publicised soon .
the hospital , which will replace ysbyty bron y garth in penrhyndeudraeth , was given the go-ahead in 2004 after a 15-year campaign .
the 30-bed unit will also have a minor injuries unit and outpatient , x-ray and rehabilitation departments .
there was a delay over the design of the hospital 's roof in 2005 .

when you think of chess players , you probably think of tangle-haired geniuses , reclusive russians , and the boys at school who were too delicate to play in the yard .
major moves boxing moves : jab : straight arm punch , using reach to keep distance hook : semi-circular punch to the side of the head uppercut : powerful rising blow chess moves : sicilian defence : opening that is black 's best chance of winning king 's gambit : old-fashioned but violent and entertaining opening for white giuoco piano : oldest known opening and the one most players learn first you probably do n't think of bulging biceps , iron jaws and sweat flying .
that 's why the mere mention of chessboxing causes so many raised eyebrows .
it 's a mixture of chess and boxing - one round of chess is followed by a round of boxing and so on until the winner is declared by knockout , checkmate or points victory .
the sport , brought into reality in 2003 by a dutch performance artist inspired by a french comic , came to the uk in april and has its headquarters at a boxing gym in north london .
on the continent , the sport 's epicentres are in amsterdam and berlin .
some might assume that boxers lack the cerebral skills required for the game of kings , while a single punch would knock a chess player 's glasses clean off his head ?
but tactical thinking , stamina and quickfire responses are vital for both sports .
the two best heavyweights of recent years are both keen chess players .
lennox lewis played chess in breaks in training and is a supporter of chess tuition for children .
vitali klitschko once said : " chess is similar to boxing .
you need to develop a strategy , and you need to think two or three steps ahead about what your opponent is doing .
you have to be smart . "
it 's hard to concentrate after you 've been punched in the head but for most non-boxing , non-chess fans , the links are esoteric .
" it 's a devilish combination , " the sport 's dutch inventor iepe rubingh tells a crowd of shaven-headed east end geezers and wild-haired cool kids at bethnal green working men 's club , east london .
he has come to see the latest instalment in chessboxing 's rise in popularity - a uk international bout .
a large chessboard sits in the middle of a boxing ring beneath the club 's dusty glitter ball .
as paramedics wait behind the ring and a rockabilly dj plays 80s electro music to the sold-out venue , there is a palpable sense of uncertainty and menace .
the lingo boxing terms southpaw : left-hander glass jaw : someone unable to withstand punches spoiler : a boxer who avoids defeat by tactics like repeated holding chess terms book : moves that conform directly to books on opening theory blunder : inadvertent loss of piece or pawn sac : short for sacrifice it lifts when the first fighters take to the stage , with a compere whipping the crowd into a frenzy and a traditional glamorous lady circling the ring with a sign declaring " round one " .
the boxers then sit down and play chess .
a bout of chessboxing stretches to 11 rounds - six of chess -lrb- four minutes each -rrb- and five of boxing -lrb- three minutes each -rrb- .
event promoter tim woolgar has put his money where his mouth is by taking part in the first bout .
unfortunately he is up against konrad rikardson from sweden , a confident chess player and even more confident boxer .
as their chess moves are tracked on a giant computer screen , a commentator guides us through the game and evaluates the players ' tactics .
a blokey cheer erupts whenever a piece is taken , but the boxers wear headphones to block out the noise .
we are told they pump out eric clapton songs all night to increase the players ' aggression .
" go on - ' ave him ! " shouts someone in the audience after a particularly good move .
" bash his bishop ! " , another yells , while the commentator sagely notes : " it 's a pawn storm . "
wolfram von stauffenberg and andy costello are chessboxing heavyweights minutes later the mood darkens as the board is moved aside , gloves and gum shields are put on and the boxing begins .
as the pair bob around the ring ducking and weaving , jabbing and defending , it becomes clear that they are deadly serious about their sport .
woolgar takes one head blow after another yet minutes later returns to drip sweat over the chessboard .
he defends himself admirably but suffers a further physical pounding before rikardson snatches his queen .
the crowd goes wild .
two further fights take place including a match between bob " the red kite " innes and james " jimbo slice " taylor , who prove to be fierce in the ring but not so confident at the chessboard .
the red kite soon falls to the floor .
by 2020 we want chessboxing to be up there with the other professional sports tim woolgar , london chessboxing club the headline fight is an impressive grudge match between germany 's wolfram von stauffenberg -lrb- white pieces -rrb- and andy costello from exeter -lrb- black pieces -rrb- .
it is clear why they are hailed as chessboxing champions as their rapid , shrewd chess playing is matched only by the vicious ferocity of their boxing .
as the pair tussle in the ring , half the crowd is baying for blood while the remainder winces as blows connect .
in a surprising twist , the audience is unanimous in its enthusiasm for their chess playing .
as costello took the checkmate it seemed von stauffenberg had a narrow escape .
after the tournament , woolgar has recovered enough to explain the pain and pleasure of chessboxing .
" i took an almighty pounding .
i have a sense that it did n't do me any good . "

advertisement chess boxing has already proved popular in germany nevertheless he is undaunted in his enthusiasm for the hybrid sport , adamant that chessboxing has an " instant appeal " that wins over " a cross section of the community " .
he now wants to encourage more young people to take it up and is aiming for it to be recognised as an olympic sport .
" we 're being realistic about it , so we 're not going for 2012 or even 2016 , " he said .
" but by 2020 we want chessboxing to be up there with the other professional sports . "
if its popularity continues to grow , chessboxing might just make it .
below is a selection of your comments .
anyone who has ever been in the ring will testify to the increased speed of mental processing bought on .
these two sports are coupled nicely - finally a pastime that you can encourage your kids to do to improve their iq and their physical capability .
patrick , cambridge , uk i play league chess and while this mash-up seems a bit contrived , it would certainly make sure no seven-year-old whizz-kid ever beats me ever again .
jer , bristol this is complete and utter rubbish ; " by 2020 we want chessboxing to be up there with the other professional sports " .
it 's two sports fused into , well you ca n't even say one because they are n't .
they are still two separate sports played sequentially ; chess - boxing .
to me this would interrupt the pace and tension of the former and latter .
aaron smiles , newcastle i understand lennox lewis plays a mean game of chess .
but i do n't think he 's ever tried this .
mark shanahan , sussex in this society where specialism is paramount , it is great to see a sport where a wide range of skills is needed .
i might just give it a go .
dan , brighton i have never boxed , but i do wrestle and play chess -lrb- albeit not at the same time -rrb- , and have found the sport and the game to have remarkable similarities : you are always thinking one or two moves ahead ; it is possible to arrive at a stalemate ; and the tables can turn quickly and irrevocably if one of the two opponents makes a mistake .
all this just goes to show that you do n't have to be a meathead to take part in combat sports .
hugh , brussels , belgium yep , no coverage of the chess world championship but we do get this .
i am all for coverage of new sports but ca n't you also cover the classics ?
this year 's chess championship was the best for many years .
simon hayward given that the bbc could n't be bothered to cover the recent world chess championship until after it had finished , why is it considered appropriate to cover this rubbish instead ?

when you think of chess players , you probably think of tangle-haired geniuses , reclusive russians , and the boys at school who were too delicate to play in the yard .
major moves boxing moves : jab : straight arm punch , using reach to keep distance hook : semi-circular punch to the side of the head uppercut : powerful rising blow chess moves : sicilian defence : opening that is black 's best chance of winning king 's gambit : old-fashioned but violent and entertaining opening for white giuoco piano : oldest known opening and the one most players learn first you probably do n't think of bulging biceps , iron jaws and sweat flying .
that 's why the mere mention of chessboxing causes so many raised eyebrows .
it 's a mixture of chess and boxing - one round of chess is followed by a round of boxing and so on until the winner is declared by knockout , checkmate or points victory .
the sport , brought into reality in 2003 by a dutch performance artist inspired by a french comic , came to the uk in april and has its headquarters at a boxing gym in north london .
on the continent , the sport 's epicentres are in amsterdam and berlin .
some might assume that boxers lack the cerebral skills required for the game of kings , while a single punch would knock a chess player 's glasses clean off his head ?
but tactical thinking , stamina and quickfire responses are vital for both sports .
the two best heavyweights of recent years are both keen chess players .
lennox lewis played chess in breaks in training and is a supporter of chess tuition for children .
vitali klitschko once said : " chess is similar to boxing .
you need to develop a strategy , and you need to think two or three steps ahead about what your opponent is doing .
you have to be smart . "
it 's hard to concentrate after you 've been punched in the head but for most non-boxing , non-chess fans , the links are esoteric .

the lingo boxing terms southpaw : left-hander glass jaw : someone unable to withstand punches spoiler : a boxer who avoids defeat by tactics like repeated holding chess terms book : moves that conform directly to books on opening theory blunder : inadvertent loss of piece or pawn sac : short for sacrifice it lifts when the first fighters take to the stage , with a compere whipping the crowd into a frenzy and a traditional glamorous lady circling the ring with a sign declaring " round one " .
the boxers then sit down and play chess .
a bout of chessboxing stretches to 11 rounds - six of chess -lrb- four minutes each -rrb- and five of boxing -lrb- three minutes each -rrb- .
event promoter tim woolgar has put his money where his mouth is by taking part in the first bout .
unfortunately he is up against konrad rikardson from sweden , a confident chess player and even more confident boxer .
as their chess moves are tracked on a giant computer screen , a commentator guides us through the game and evaluates the players ' tactics .
a blokey cheer erupts whenever a piece is taken , but the boxers wear headphones to block out the noise .
we are told they pump out eric clapton songs all night to increase the players ' aggression .
" go on - ' ave him ! " shouts someone in the audience after a particularly good move .

wolfram von stauffenberg and andy costello are chessboxing heavyweights minutes later the mood darkens as the board is moved aside , gloves and gum shields are put on and the boxing begins .
as the pair bob around the ring ducking and weaving , jabbing and defending , it becomes clear that they are deadly serious about their sport .
woolgar takes one head blow after another yet minutes later returns to drip sweat over the chessboard .
he defends himself admirably but suffers a further physical pounding before rikardson snatches his queen .
the crowd goes wild .
two further fights take place including a match between bob " the red kite " innes and james " jimbo slice " taylor , who prove to be fierce in the ring but not so confident at the chessboard .
the red kite soon falls to the floor .

it is clear why they are hailed as chessboxing champions as their rapid , shrewd chess playing is matched only by the vicious ferocity of their boxing .
as the pair tussle in the ring , half the crowd is baying for blood while the remainder winces as blows connect .
in a surprising twist , the audience is unanimous in its enthusiasm for their chess playing .
as costello took the checkmate it seemed von stauffenberg had a narrow escape .

aaron smiles , newcastle i understand lennox lewis plays a mean game of chess .
but i do n't think he 's ever tried this .
mark shanahan , sussex in this society where specialism is paramount , it is great to see a sport where a wide range of skills is needed .
i might just give it a go .
dan , brighton i have never boxed , but i do wrestle and play chess -lrb- albeit not at the same time -rrb- , and have found the sport and the game to have remarkable similarities : you are always thinking one or two moves ahead ; it is possible to arrive at a stalemate ; and the tables can turn quickly and irrevocably if one of the two opponents makes a mistake .
all this just goes to show that you do n't have to be a meathead to take part in combat sports .
hugh , brussels , belgium yep , no coverage of the chess world championship but we do get this .
i am all for coverage of new sports but ca n't you also cover the classics ?
this year 's chess championship was the best for many years .
simon hayward given that the bbc could n't be bothered to cover the recent world chess championship until after it had finished , why is it considered appropriate to cover this rubbish instead ?
justin horton , huesca province , spain i 'm now looking forward to boxing bingo or shot-put scrabble .

boys watching similar programmes , like friends and sex and the city , were also more likely to get a girl pregnant , the research in pediatrics found .
the study authors said limiting exposure to sexual content on tv might reduce teen pregnancies .
experts urged parents to talk more openly with their children about sex .
study author dr anita chandra of the rand corporation said adolescents received a considerable amount of information about sex through television and the problem was that programmes such as these typically did not highlight the risks and responsibilities of sex .
sexual content on tv has doubled in the last few years , especially during the period of our research .
we found a strong association lead researcher dr anita chandra she said : " our findings suggest that television may play a significant role in the high rates of teenage pregnancy in the us . "
according to dr chandra , hers is the first study to show such a direct link .
the researchers interviewed 2,000 adolescents aged 12 to 17 three times between 2001 and 2004 .
teens who watched larger amounts of sexually charged tv shows were twice as likely to experience a pregnancy in the subsequent three years , compared with those with lower levels of exposure .
sexual content by the third interview , 744 of the teenagers said they had engaged in sexual intercourse and 718 of the youths shared with the researchers information about their pregnancy histories .

" information such as this empowers parents when making difficult decisions as to what they do and do n't allow their daughters to watch , " she said .
psychologist david walsh , president of the national institute on media and the family said many teenagers relied on the media to act as sex educator .
dr walsh said : " if you have a kid who no-one 's talking to about sex and who then watches sitcoms on tv where sex is presented as ' this is what cool people do ' , the outcome is obvious .
" the message to parents is to talk to their kids about sex long before they become teenagers . "
a spokeswoman from brook said : " the causes of teen pregnancy in the uk are quite complex .
" there are a range of ways we can try to reduce the teen pregnancy rate , such as providing sex and relationship education and outreach and community services for young people .

alison silva had asked the jury to award damages of $ 711,974 -lrb- £ 453,500 -rrb- , which included medical bills , lost wages and punitive damages .
" i respect the jury 's decision , " mr silva told reporters after the verdict was delivered .
the film star , who was also in the courthouse , declined to comment .
contradictory statements mr silva claimed that the star , whose credits include speed and the matrix films , struck him with his porsche in march 2007 , causing him to fall and injure his left wrist .
jurors , who unanimously rejected the case , heard how mr silva gave contradictory statements about what happened .
they were also shown a video of the photographer using his supposedly damaged hand to climb down a fence after filming britney spears .
mr silva said he would continue to work as a paparazzo despite the jury 's decision .
when asked if he would ever attempt to take the hollywood star 's photo again , he responded " why not ?
it 's business . "
" i wish keanu is happy in his life .
i have nothing against keanu , " he added .
reeves remained in the courthouse throughout the five-day trial , occasionally signing autographs in the hallway .
he will next appear in a remake of the day the earth stood still , due to be released next month .

alison silva had asked the jury to award damages of $ 711,974 -lrb- £ 453,500 -rrb- , which included medical bills , lost wages and punitive damages .
" i respect the jury 's decision , " mr silva told reporters after the verdict was delivered .
the film star , who was also in the courthouse , declined to comment .
contradictory statements mr silva claimed that the star , whose credits include speed and the matrix films , struck him with his porsche in march 2007 , causing him to fall and injure his left wrist .
jurors , who unanimously rejected the case , heard how mr silva gave contradictory statements about what happened .
they were also shown a video of the photographer using his supposedly damaged hand to climb down a fence after filming britney spears .
mr silva said he would continue to work as a paparazzo despite the jury 's decision .
when asked if he would ever attempt to take the hollywood star 's photo again , he responded " why not ?
it 's business . "
" i wish keanu is happy in his life .
i have nothing against keanu , " he added .
reeves remained in the courthouse throughout the five-day trial , occasionally signing autographs in the hallway .
he will next appear in a remake of the day the earth stood still , due to be released next month .

bbc news -pipe- school report -pipe- students report uk-china leg of the box bbc news / school report graphics version bbc sport home 10:26 gmt , tuesday , 4 november 2008 students report uk-china leg of the box students from norfolk and shanghai went dockside for the latest news on the shipping container which the bbc are tracking around world .
find out more about the bbc box pupils from neatherd high school and nanyang middle school interviewed sales manager scott wu from the nyk shipping line about the uk-china leg of the box 's global journey .
report by tony from nanyang middle school more twinning details on the world class website below is a report written by five students from neatherd high school in norfolk , who visited the box in shanghai 's container port .
by evie , sam , sarah , courtenay and sian from neatherd high school , dereham the box is here !
amidst the maze of towering blocks of containers , stacked seven containers up , and noticeable for its red and white livery , sat the bbc 's container .
after spending at least a week crossing the british isles from scotland to southampton , the box spent a further four weeks crossing the waves to reach china 's east coast - and we thought that our ten hour flight from amsterdam was long and tiring .
stacking up frank xu and scott wu , deputy general managers of nyk logistics , an international container mega-carrier , welcomed us to their offices in central shanghai , before we drove to their depot at the port .
the huge 1.95 kilometre-squared terminal , which is the largest in the world , is managed by a computer system to keep track of almost 40,000 containers ' operations per day ; that 's approximately 28.5 million units of freight per year .
keeping track a forklift soon arrived to lower the box , which stood amongst the sea of blue , green , black and white containers .
alas , the whisky had already gone and was being delivered around the city .
as we walked inside , we were intrigued by a gps device welded to the inside corner , which is tracking the box 's travels .
every other container is identified by a code printed onto its side and must be identified , stacked and checked without any such technology .
mr scott said that containers are occasionally lost , both at sea and in the towering skyline at ports , but they that are always discovered after an immediate investigation , with support of a computer system , affectionately known as oscar -lrb- one system to cover all regions -rrb- .
he added that it 's a rare occurrence .
dangerous waters fortunately , the vessel did n't come under threat from pirates in the south china sea .
nonetheless the ship is equipped with the latest technology in controlling piracy : a water cannon .
" a very power water gun ! " claims scott wu .
we sometimes hear of stowaways hiding in these large containers , but shanghai is lucky enough to have an x-ray scanner , capable of searching any container in just five minutes .
cultural exchange as for our stay in shanghai , we can only say that the difference between london and shanghai is as great as the difference between dereham and london .
our lives in norfolk seem so far removed from this city and the students at nanyang middle school .
we know that while whisky is among the most common british exports to china , they send us so much .
to see how closely bound we are , both economically and in our daily lives , is incredible .
shanghai is only the first step on the box 's tour of the globe and its working schedule will carry it over 50,000 nautical miles -lrb- 90,000km -rrb- , or twice around the world .
the next step ?

the company added that its grocery division - which includes brands such as twinings tea and ryvita crispbread - had seen operating profits rise 27 % to £ 194m .
however , profits at its sugar division fell to £ 155m from £ 199m a year ago as a result of reforms to the eu sugar sector .

chris cillizza in the fix blog , washington post : the keys to obama 's victory are myriad but two factors stand out : the remarkable unpopularity of president george w bush and the democratic nominee 's massive fundraising edge ...
while mccain did his best to separate himself from the tarnished bush brand , exit polling in key states showed he had not done enough .

1008 i wonder how mr mccain views his loss .
is it easier to take than in 2000 , when he was beaten by george w bush to the republican nomination ?
the wisdom in football - or soccer , to our us readers - is that it is more disappointing to be eliminated from a competition at the semi-final stage than to lose the final .
at least mr mccain 's name will appear in even the most basic historic accounts of this election .
at least his does n't have quite the same sense of " what if ? "
at least he has been to the " show " , not just the very public auditions .
1001 it still seems that nothing could be finer than the result from north carolina .
so far it looks like 49.8 % for obama and 49.6 % for mccain .
there are several other issues on the ballot which could be delaying the count .
0957 is it a double win ?
in tuesday 's live text , we mentioned that two american bison - named john and barack - were engaged in a popularity contest among staff at the uk 's whipsnade zoo .

a zoo spokeswoman says : " barack won hoofs down , thanks to his friendly personality and hairy good looks .
he is currently munching on his carrot , triumphantly , while john watches from the sidelines .
keepers have commiserated with him and he 's had some hay to compensate . "
a bitter taste indeed , one imagines .

joan , sheffield , uk : i think obama is a very brave man but whether he can live up to the expectations that have been placed on him remains to be seen , never has a president carried with him the hopes and dreams of so many americans .

ireland 's brian cowen says mr obama " serves as a beacon of hope , not just in america " .
0913 a quick point for those of you who might be wondering why our total amount of electoral college votes declared for mr mccain and mr obama -lrb- 511 -rrb- - when added to the 26 left for missouri and north carolina - comes to 537 , rather than the total of 538 .
apparently nebraska , which gives its five votes out district-by-district - rather than on a winner-takes-all basis - has only declared four of them so far .

0733 bbc north america editor justin webb : the obama years will stretch america .
the nation will come to think differently about itself .
but barack obama is too focused and too , well , too midwestern in outlook , to really stick it to the right .
he will govern from the centre and relish the battles with his own party that that will entail .
he will do it because he will feel it to be right but also , of course , because that is the way to be re-elected in 2012 , overcoming the fearsome challenge of sarah palin .

pity poor walter mondale , who managed only 13 in 1984 .
0715 if it 's " morning in america " , it 's probably nearing lunchtime in mr obama 's mind , as he gets to grips with some longer-term thinking .

among the names mentioned are john kerry , runner-up to george w bush in the 2004 election , for secretary of state and republican colin powell - who supported mr obama during this contest - for defence secretary .

mr mckinnon faces extradition to the us for breaking into american military networks between february 2001 and march 2002 .
he trespassed on networks owned by nasa , the us army , navy , air force , and department of defense .
if tried and convicted in a us court , mr mckinnon could face decades of jail time , and millions of dollars in fines .
medical notes despite taking his appeal to the house of lords , mr mckinnon lost a six-year legal battle to avoid extradition .
the european court of human rights also declined to back mr mckinnon 's case against extradition .
mr mckinnon is currently awaiting a decision by home secretary jacqui smith as to when the extradition process will begin .
in the interim , 20 uk mps have signed an early day motion which calls for any sentence imposed by a us court to be served in a british jail .
drawn up by shadow justice minister david burrowes , who is mr mckinnon 's mp , the motion cites the practice of the netherlands , and israel , which routinely request that nationals suffering medical or mental problems are repatriated to serve their sentence .
it urged jacqui smith to delay extradition proceedings until she had won assurances from the us that mr mckinnon , who has been diagnosed with asperger 's syndrome , would be sent back to the uk to serve his sentence .
mr burrowes tabled the motion after receiving word from the government that mr mckinnon 's diagnosis with asperger 's was not sufficient grounds for refusing the extradition order .

mr mckinnon faces extradition to the us for breaking into american military networks between february 2001 and march 2002 .
he trespassed on networks owned by nasa , the us army , navy , air force , and department of defense .
if tried and convicted in a us court , mr mckinnon could face decades of jail time , and millions of dollars in fines .
medical notes despite taking his appeal to the house of lords , mr mckinnon lost a six-year legal battle to avoid extradition .
the european court of human rights also declined to back mr mckinnon 's case against extradition .
mr mckinnon is currently awaiting a decision by home secretary jacqui smith as to when the extradition process will begin .
in the interim , 20 uk mps have signed an early day motion which calls for any sentence imposed by a us court to be served in a british jail .
drawn up by shadow justice minister david burrowes , who is mr mckinnon 's mp , the motion cites the practice of the netherlands , and israel , which routinely request that nationals suffering medical or mental problems are repatriated to serve their sentence .
it urged jacqui smith to delay extradition proceedings until she had won assurances from the us that mr mckinnon , who has been diagnosed with asperger 's syndrome , would be sent back to the uk to serve his sentence .
mr burrowes tabled the motion after receiving word from the government that mr mckinnon 's diagnosis with asperger 's was not sufficient grounds for refusing the extradition order .

mr mckinnon is currently awaiting a decision by home secretary jacqui smith as to when the extradition process will begin .
in the interim , 20 uk mps have signed an early day motion which calls for any sentence imposed by a us court to be served in a british jail .
drawn up by shadow justice minister david burrowes , who is mr mckinnon 's mp , the motion cites the practice of the netherlands , and israel , which routinely request that nationals suffering medical or mental problems are repatriated to serve their sentence .
it urged jacqui smith to delay extradition proceedings until she had won assurances from the us that mr mckinnon , who has been diagnosed with asperger 's syndrome , would be sent back to the uk to serve his sentence .
mr burrowes tabled the motion after receiving word from the government that mr mckinnon 's diagnosis with asperger 's was not sufficient grounds for refusing the extradition order .

omar osama bin laden , aged 27 , made his claim after a scheduled stopover at madrid 's barajas airport on a flight from egypt to morocco .
the reasons for his asylum request were not immediately clear .
the self-declared pacifist son of the al-qaeda leader was earlier this year refused entry to live in the uk with his 52-year-old british wife .
the spanish authorities said they would deal with mr bin laden 's case " speedily " , spain 's el pais newspaper reported .
he was carrying a saudi passport , the spanish interior ministry officials said .
he currently lives in cairo , with wife zaina alsabah-bin laden , formerly named jane felix-browne , from cheshire .
they had hoped to move to mrs bin laden 's home in north-western england .
the couple said the visa application was rejected in april after the british authorities had judged that it might not be " conducive to the public good " .
it is thought the authorities were referring to comments made by mr bin laden that he could not prove 100 % that his father - whom he says he has not seen since he was 19 - was responsible for the 2001 attacks in the us or the london bombings in 2005 .
mrs bin laden , who is severely visually impaired , said she needed access to medical treatment in the uk but refused to be apart from her husband .
mr bin laden is one of 19 sons of the al-qaeda leader .

vinayagamurthy muralitharan , widely known as colonel karuna , said that the rehabilitation of former cadres under his command had already begun .
the former senior tamil tiger leader broke away from the rebels in 2004 .
it was a major setback to the rebel movement and contributed to their loss of control of the east in 2007 .
if the rehabilitation process is fully implemented , it will be the first time in sri lanka that a group which took up arms against the state is integrated into the state security establishment .
paramilitary group " i talked with the defence secretary several times , " col karuna , who is the leader of the tamil makkal viduthalai puligal -lrb- tmvp -rrb- party , told the bbc sinhala service .
" we made a plan for that .
i think the initial work for nearly 300 cadres to be recruited to the security forces has already begun .
if they have any qualification they can join police - others can join the civil defence force -lrb- cdf -rrb- . "
the former senior tamil tiger leader is now a member of parliament in president rajapaksa 's united people 's freedom alliance .
col karuna did not reveal the current armed strength of the tmvp - but at the time of his defection he said that more than 6,000 fighters had accompanied him .
the tmvp was initially a paramilitary group but was registered as a political party while he was serving a prison sentence for immigration offences in the uk .
the deputy leader of the tmvp , sivanesthurai chandrakanthan , was appointed as the chief minister of the eastern province after elections earlier this year .
" i do n't think we need weapons or armed cadres any longer .
we are a political party now .
all our leaders have entered the democratic process and we all get security provided from the government , " col karuna said .
he said that a thorough screening process would be put in place to prevent tamil tigers infiltrating the security forces and stressed that there are no plans at present to recruit former rebels to the armed forces .
despite joining the political process , the tmvp has been regularly accused of human rights violations - including child recruitment and abductions - by the united nations and international human rights groups .

vinayagamurthy muralitharan , widely known as colonel karuna , said that the rehabilitation of former cadres under his command had already begun .
the former senior tamil tiger leader broke away from the rebels in 2004 .
it was a major setback to the rebel movement and contributed to their loss of control of the east in 2007 .
if the rehabilitation process is fully implemented , it will be the first time in sri lanka that a group which took up arms against the state is integrated into the state security establishment .

the former senior tamil tiger leader is now a member of parliament in president rajapaksa 's united people 's freedom alliance .
col karuna did not reveal the current armed strength of the tmvp - but at the time of his defection he said that more than 6,000 fighters had accompanied him .
the tmvp was initially a paramilitary group but was registered as a political party while he was serving a prison sentence for immigration offences in the uk .
the deputy leader of the tmvp , sivanesthurai chandrakanthan , was appointed as the chief minister of the eastern province after elections earlier this year .
" i do n't think we need weapons or armed cadres any longer .

all our leaders have entered the democratic process and we all get security provided from the government , " col karuna said .
he said that a thorough screening process would be put in place to prevent tamil tigers infiltrating the security forces and stressed that there are no plans at present to recruit former rebels to the armed forces .

the former senior tamil tiger leader broke away from the rebels in 2004 .
