weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .
the purpose of these repeated recordings is to calculate the characteristics of the athlete 's body . a quicker recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport science can fast-track athletes ' recovery from injuries the list of muscle characteristics plays an important role after injuries if the athlete needs to return to top form as soon as possible .
that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .
but when a sport promotes very one-sided training , like shot-put for example , it is important to train up the other side as well , for the body to stay healthy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health is often sidelined as athletes push their limits however , as chances of setting new world records are getting smaller , many athletes are increasingly willing to sideline their health .
in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .

psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .

" bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .

that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .

in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .
the purpose of these repeated recordings is to calculate the characteristics of the athlete 's body . a quicker recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport science can fast-track athletes ' recovery from injuries the list of muscle characteristics plays an important role after injuries if the athlete needs to return to top form as soon as possible .
that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .
the purpose of these repeated recordings is to calculate the characteristics of the athlete 's body . a quicker recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport science can fast-track athletes ' recovery from injuries the list of muscle characteristics plays an important role after injuries if the athlete needs to return to top form as soon as possible .
that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .
but when a sport promotes very one-sided training , like shot-put for example , it is important to train up the other side as well , for the body to stay healthy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health is often sidelined as athletes push their limits however , as chances of setting new world records are getting smaller , many athletes are increasingly willing to sideline their health .
in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 24.08.2008 opinion : the beijing pretense games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the olympic games in beijing come to a close on sunday , aug .
24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .

" the extent of the use of military force by the russian side appears - seen from here and despite reports to the contrary from georgia and the picture conveyed by the media - not inappropriately high , " brigadier general heinz g wagner wrote on aug .
11 . the german foreign ministry said it did not comment on internal documents . according to the faz report , the general said some three days after the outbreak of hostilities that russia had no choice but to react to the georgian military action in south ossetia . the russian peacekeeping forces stationed in the breakaway georgian region " were not in a position , given their weapons and equipment , to defend themselves effectively or even to resist , " the general wrote . protecting forces ? russia had been compelled to ensure that the land forces of its 58th army were able to move without being threatened by the georgian air force , and for this reason georgian planes had been prevented from intervening , wagner wrote . the russians had moved to strengthen their peacekeepers , deployed under a mandate from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , to protect russian citizens and to restore the status quo ante , the attache said . " the deployment of air power - despite the regrettable civilian casualties - can be seen as militarily appropriate to the operation , " wagner wrote , according to the faz report . wagner 's report contrasted with the official german government position . merkel thinks differently chancellor angela merkel visited tbilisi on aug.17 to offer support to georgian president mikheil saakashvili and call for russia to adhere to the ceasefire agreement signed the previous day by russian president dmitry medvedev . germany demands that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory and has criticized the russian for not sticking to their side of the bargain . merkel also made clear that germany backed ultimate nato membership for georgia . " georgia will become a member if it wants to , " she said . at the nato summit in bucharest in april , germany was one of the countries expressing caution on georgian membership of the western military alliance . the summit decided that georgia and ukraine , another former republic of the defunct soviet union , should not receive membership action plans -lrb- maps -rrb- - the precursor to full membership . nato foreign ministers are to take up the issue at a meeting in december . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.08.2008 sculptor recalls children flight from nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 children escaped the nazis on transport trains to england in 1938 and 1939 holocaust survivor frank meisler was 10 when he fled the nazis in 1939 .
after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .
on nov .
30 - 70 years to the day when the first " kindertransporte " to england began , it will be inaugurated . three days after meisler left germany for england , his parents were arrested by the gestapo and later murdered at auschwitz . although he has a lot to do with abstract art , meisler insists that real life-size figures were needed for his latest work .
people using the friedrichstrasse station had to be able to identify with the sculpture , he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .

after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .
on nov .
30 - 70 years to the day when the first " kindertransporte " to england began , it will be inaugurated . three days after meisler left germany for england , his parents were arrested by the gestapo and later murdered at auschwitz . although he has a lot to do with abstract art , meisler insists that real life-size figures were needed for his latest work .
people using the friedrichstrasse station had to be able to identify with the sculpture , he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long .

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german politician : lecturing china wo n't improve human rights the olympics have raised awareness about human rights in china .
a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well .
-lrb- 23.08.2008 -rrb- beijing under fire for detaining pro-tibet activists beijing police have ordered 10 pro-tibet activists from germany , britain and the us to 10 days detention .
the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington .
-lrb- 22.08.2008 -rrb- opinion : you 've come a long way beijing china has a long way to go with democratic reforms , but the olympic games represent a milestone for how far it has already come .
dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years .

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german politician : lecturing china wo n't improve human rights the olympics have raised awareness about human rights in china .
a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well .
-lrb- 23.08.2008 -rrb- beijing under fire for detaining pro-tibet activists beijing police have ordered 10 pro-tibet activists from germany , britain and the us to 10 days detention .
the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington .
-lrb- 22.08.2008 -rrb- opinion : you 've come a long way beijing china has a long way to go with democratic reforms , but the olympic games represent a milestone for how far it has already come .
dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years .

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long . " the work for london 2012 begins on monday , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .

when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .

in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .

" it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .
they observe some of them quite closely to gauge troop morale . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long .

after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .
on nov .
30 - 70 years to the day when the first " kindertransporte " to england began , it will be inaugurated . three days after meisler left germany for england , his parents were arrested by the gestapo and later murdered at auschwitz . although he has a lot to do with abstract art , meisler insists that real life-size figures were needed for his latest work .
people using the friedrichstrasse station had to be able to identify with the sculpture , he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .

inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .

they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .
the purpose of these repeated recordings is to calculate the characteristics of the athlete 's body . a quicker recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport science can fast-track athletes ' recovery from injuries the list of muscle characteristics plays an important role after injuries if the athlete needs to return to top form as soon as possible .
that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .
but when a sport promotes very one-sided training , like shot-put for example , it is important to train up the other side as well , for the body to stay healthy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health is often sidelined as athletes push their limits however , as chances of setting new world records are getting smaller , many athletes are increasingly willing to sideline their health .
in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .
that is really our goal , the link between improving performance and keeping a healthy body . " carl-josef kutzbach -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long .

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long . " the work for london 2012 begins on monday , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .

while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german politician : lecturing china wo n't improve human rights the olympics have raised awareness about human rights in china .
a leading german human rights politician told dw-world.de that it does n't make sense to lecture beijing without lauding it as well .
-lrb- 23.08.2008 -rrb- beijing under fire for detaining pro-tibet activists beijing police have ordered 10 pro-tibet activists from germany , britain and the us to 10 days detention .
the harsh penalty has drawn hefty criticism , particularly from washington .
-lrb- 22.08.2008 -rrb- opinion : you 've come a long way beijing china has a long way to go with democratic reforms , but the olympic games represent a milestone for how far it has already come .
dw 's diana fong looks back at how china has opened up in the last 30 years .

after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.08.2008 german military concerned about soldier blogs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet access endangering german soldiers abroad ?
weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .
they observe some of them quite closely to gauge troop morale . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .
on nov .
30 - 70 years to the day when the first " kindertransporte " to england began , it will be inaugurated . three days after meisler left germany for england , his parents were arrested by the gestapo and later murdered at auschwitz . although he has a lot to do with abstract art , meisler insists that real life-size figures were needed for his latest work .
people using the friedrichstrasse station had to be able to identify with the sculpture , he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .

in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .
they observe some of them quite closely to gauge troop morale . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .

after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long . " the work for london 2012 begins on monday , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 24.08.2008 opinion : the beijing pretense games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the olympic games in beijing come to a close on sunday , aug .
24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .
the purpose of these repeated recordings is to calculate the characteristics of the athlete 's body . a quicker recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport science can fast-track athletes ' recovery from injuries the list of muscle characteristics plays an important role after injuries if the athlete needs to return to top form as soon as possible .
that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .
but when a sport promotes very one-sided training , like shot-put for example , it is important to train up the other side as well , for the body to stay healthy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health is often sidelined as athletes push their limits however , as chances of setting new world records are getting smaller , many athletes are increasingly willing to sideline their health .
in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .
that is really our goal , the link between improving performance and keeping a healthy body . " carl-josef kutzbach -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 24.08.2008 german military concerned about soldier blogs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is internet access endangering german soldiers abroad ?
weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .
they observe some of them quite closely to gauge troop morale . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 24.08.2008 investigating the limits of sport performance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes have to go further and further to set new records how far can an athlete go ?
deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .
the purpose of these repeated recordings is to calculate the characteristics of the athlete 's body . a quicker recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport science can fast-track athletes ' recovery from injuries the list of muscle characteristics plays an important role after injuries if the athlete needs to return to top form as soon as possible .
that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .
but when a sport promotes very one-sided training , like shot-put for example , it is important to train up the other side as well , for the body to stay healthy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health is often sidelined as athletes push their limits however , as chances of setting new world records are getting smaller , many athletes are increasingly willing to sideline their health .
in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .
that is really our goal , the link between improving performance and keeping a healthy body . " carl-josef kutzbach -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names .

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .
the purpose of these repeated recordings is to calculate the characteristics of the athlete 's body . a quicker recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport science can fast-track athletes ' recovery from injuries the list of muscle characteristics plays an important role after injuries if the athlete needs to return to top form as soon as possible .
that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .
but when a sport promotes very one-sided training , like shot-put for example , it is important to train up the other side as well , for the body to stay healthy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health is often sidelined as athletes push their limits however , as chances of setting new world records are getting smaller , many athletes are increasingly willing to sideline their health .
in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .

deutsche welle visited stuttgart university ’ s institute of sport science to see how sport scientists investigate the boundaries of physical ability . in the main hall at the university of stuttgart 's institute of sport science , there is a row of equipment that looks like a cross between dentists ' chairs and torture instruments , but it 's all intended to measure athletes ' physical performance . " it 's not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance .
there are certainly absolute boundaries that we can not surpass .
an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds , regardless of how much we develop further .
let ’ s say at least within the next 100 years , " says biomechanics professor wilfried alt . but it is still difficult to identify an absolute boundary because athletes could have genetic predispositions that can give them a performance boost , which is just enough to set a new record . " the overall results , with slight increases in performance , will approach an absolute boundary that we can not specify for certain , and that we can not express in numbers , " dr. alt said . but for now a team headed by dr. bubeck , who leads cooperation with the olympic training and research center in stuttgart , measures athletes ' performance ability .
this is demonstrated by gymnast andreas hofer , who jumps onto a platform fitted with sensors .
a computer displays how much power was in the jump , how quick it was , the height of the jump and so on .

that is how one wrestler managed to return to form for the olympic games in a relatively short amount of time . " in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive , and the athlete was also with us .
when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders .
afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately .
we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations , " dr. bubeck explained . health before performance the training program at the sport science institute above all tries to ensure that top athletes avoid injuries and stay healthy .
for example , in an exercise to measure torso power , andrea hofer registers more force on his right-hand side .
in this case , the bias is not pronounced enough to pose a danger .
but when a sport promotes very one-sided training , like shot-put for example , it is important to train up the other side as well , for the body to stay healthy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health is often sidelined as athletes push their limits however , as chances of setting new world records are getting smaller , many athletes are increasingly willing to sideline their health .
in the last few years , not only doping cases have risen , but also legal use of painkillers , which athletes use to suppress the body ’ s warning signs of overexertion . dr. alt explained that sport science is working against these trends to help every athlete reach his or her optimal performance healthily . " in order for this to change , it is important that not only reaching an imaginary boundary stands in the forefront , but also the healthy performance development and the fact that none of the organisms function systems are pushed beyond their tolerance levels .

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .
but the military leadership desperately wants to put an end to the blogs . french soldiers with blogs are meant to be more careful in the future - especially when it comes to revealing information about equipment and their place of deployment .
the new french army chief , elrick irastorza , has issued a directive on this at the end of july .
the directive says that the publication of sensitive information in blogs and internet forums endangers military operations , the life of soldiers in active duty and the lives of their relatives at home . staying anonymous in germany , bundeswehr officials said that it 's hard and almost impossible to control bloggers .
so far , germany has no rules on blogging , but a german soldier is contractually bound to keep military secrets to himself , said christian dienst , a bundeswehr spokesman . but he also said that bundeswehr leaders might consider further steps should the blogging trend continue .
the least bloggers could do is not use their real names . " pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks , for example , " dienst said . morale gauge the main problem of military blogs is that they can only convey " subjective impressions of individual soldiers , which are multiplied when they 're published on the internet , " dienst added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim wohlgethan has written about the bundeswehr in afghanistan " a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match-ball for domestic politics , " dienst said , referring to " final stop kabul , " a blog by former german soldier achim wohlgethan , who does not hold back his criticism of the bundeswehr 's state of equipment in afghanistan . " bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half-truths , " dienst said .
a lack of knowledge about the larger political picture could lead to the inadvertent publication of sensitive information , which can play into the hands of terrorists , he added . but the blogs are also an important source of information for bundeswehr officials .

weblogs have become very popular among soldiers , but military strategists worry that the internet diaries wo n't just damage the troops ' reputation .
they 're also concerned that they might threaten soldiers ' lives . psychologists recommend that people use diaries to get through rough spots in their lives .
psychologists at germany 's military , the bundeswehr , are no different and tell soldiers to write down their experiences .
they just should n't do it online . that does n't seem to prevent soldiers from doing so .
the web site milblogging.com alone currently has some 2,080 military blogs that are written by soldiers from 38 countries .
us soldiers are by far the most prolific writers , but 42 german and five french soldiers have also registered their diaries on the site . source of information the american dominance is n't surprising , since blogging is much more widespread in the us than in europe .
but military strategists in the old world are eyeing the development with concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even embedded journalists sometimes do n't reveal as much as soldiers next to regular war coverage by the media , military blogs in the us have turned into a secondary source of information .
soldiers sometimes reveal details that even officially " embedded " journalists are not allowed to report on . as a result , us military officials announced last year that they would check texts , picture and videos that bloggers want to publish and would ban web sites such as youtube in military bases . the us army did so just one day before well-known blogger colby buzzel received the lulu blooker prize for his blog " my war : killing time in iraq . "
the highly praised diary , which talks about death , destruction and a lot of boredom and has been translated into seven languages shows how hard it is to stop soldiers from sharing their stories . a place to vent some soldiers post pictures online that show them posing with their weapons .
even the most innocent description of a view from a window can reveal military secrets , however .
some soldiers enthusiastically write about their experiences , others , like buzzel , share their frustration and boredom . " i 'm just waiting for time to pass , " writes one soldier , who is based in afghanistan .
" slowly , i 've had enough . " another wonders what his reception at home will be like . " how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because we 've killed someone in cold blood on command ? " he asks . these are still exceptions in france .

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the extent of the use of military force by the russian side appears - seen from here and despite reports to the contrary from georgia and the picture conveyed by the media - not inappropriately high , " brigadier general heinz g wagner wrote on aug .
11 . the german foreign ministry said it did not comment on internal documents . according to the faz report , the general said some three days after the outbreak of hostilities that russia had no choice but to react to the georgian military action in south ossetia . the russian peacekeeping forces stationed in the breakaway georgian region " were not in a position , given their weapons and equipment , to defend themselves effectively or even to resist , " the general wrote . protecting forces ? russia had been compelled to ensure that the land forces of its 58th army were able to move without being threatened by the georgian air force , and for this reason georgian planes had been prevented from intervening , wagner wrote . the russians had moved to strengthen their peacekeepers , deployed under a mandate from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , to protect russian citizens and to restore the status quo ante , the attache said . " the deployment of air power - despite the regrettable civilian casualties - can be seen as militarily appropriate to the operation , " wagner wrote , according to the faz report . wagner 's report contrasted with the official german government position . merkel thinks differently chancellor angela merkel visited tbilisi on aug.17 to offer support to georgian president mikheil saakashvili and call for russia to adhere to the ceasefire agreement signed the previous day by russian president dmitry medvedev . germany demands that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory and has criticized the russian for not sticking to their side of the bargain . merkel also made clear that germany backed ultimate nato membership for georgia . " georgia will become a member if it wants to , " she said . at the nato summit in bucharest in april , germany was one of the countries expressing caution on georgian membership of the western military alliance . the summit decided that georgia and ukraine , another former republic of the defunct soviet union , should not receive membership action plans -lrb- maps -rrb- - the precursor to full membership . nato foreign ministers are to take up the issue at a meeting in december . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .
this liberalization could also expand to other parts of society in coming years .
major changes take a long time to become visible in china .
the future will show whether - and how - the games have changed china . matthias von hein heads dw-radio 's chinese service -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .
on nov .
30 - 70 years to the day when the first " kindertransporte " to england began , it will be inaugurated . three days after meisler left germany for england , his parents were arrested by the gestapo and later murdered at auschwitz . although he has a lot to do with abstract art , meisler insists that real life-size figures were needed for his latest work .
people using the friedrichstrasse station had to be able to identify with the sculpture , he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long . " the work for london 2012 begins on monday , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.08.2008 sculptor recalls children flight from nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 children escaped the nazis on transport trains to england in 1938 and 1939 holocaust survivor frank meisler was 10 when he fled the nazis in 1939 .
after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .
on nov .
30 - 70 years to the day when the first " kindertransporte " to england began , it will be inaugurated . three days after meisler left germany for england , his parents were arrested by the gestapo and later murdered at auschwitz . although he has a lot to do with abstract art , meisler insists that real life-size figures were needed for his latest work .
people using the friedrichstrasse station had to be able to identify with the sculpture , he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long . " the work for london 2012 begins on monday , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 23.08.2008 -rrb- german team increases olympic medal count with just two days of olympic competition left , the german medal tally has risen to 36 .
thanks to a lot of hard-working rowers and one woman who came through with a lot of fancy sword work in the modern pentathlon .

it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .

small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .

24 , german officials said they were pleased with the overall result of their athletes .
they want to focus on core sports to get more medals in 2012 . members of the german olympic sports federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- seemed to have forgotten that they 'd originally set a goal of at least bringing home as many medal as they did during the 2004 athens olympics - 49 in total . while german athletes actually topped the number of gold medals - winning 16 compared to 13 four years ago - they only got 41 medals in china , including 10 silver and 15 bronze medals .
this leaves germany in fifth place in the medal count , trailing china , the us , russia and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael vesper " in total , our appearance in beijing and our sports results are more than satisfactory , " said dosb 's director general , michael vesper , at a concluding press conference in the chinese capital on sunday . dosb officials also praised the fact that german athletes had won gold in 12 disciplines as opposed to eight in 2004 .
in addition to the medals , 139 athletes also ended up on ranks 4 through 10 . international medal race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese got to celebrate the most despite that , german sports officials are bound to have their work cut out for them if they want to shine at the 2012 london olympics : since 1992 , the number of medals for germany has been steadily declining . dosb president thomas bach , who is also the vice president of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , said that more and more countries had discovered sports successes as a way to improve their images internationally and were aggressively sponsoring athletes to bring home medals .
while 74 nations had athletes climb the winners ' podiums in athens , that number rose to 85 in beijing . " it 's become very obvious here that more resources than ever are funnelled into competitive sports , " bach said . vesper added that germany had to think about how it should react . " we need a societal debate on how much competitive sports are worth to us , " he said , adding that the state and the business world had to work together on this . secondary successes ? another worrying trend is germany 's success in secondary sports that only get media attention every four years at the olympics , including judo , weight-lifting , triathlon or modern pentathlon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta steffen got a champion 's welcome in berlin this week in star sports , such as swimming , britta steffen managed to prevent a complete german disaster by winning gold twice .
christina obergfoell 's bronze medal in javelin throw was the only glimpse of german success in track-and-fields , leading officials to call for a doubling of funds for the olympic core sport .
financial awards , which have been given to athletes in the past , will now be given to sports associations to help them pay for their work . germans did n't fare much better in ball games , where the germans only got gold in hockey against spain . but the dosb 's vesper said that the successes and shortcomings wo n't be mulled on for too long . " the work for london 2012 begins on monday , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , dw 's matthias von hein says that all those involved have been doing a lot of pretending during the last two weeks . it was a perfect showing of achievements .
it was what the olympic comittee had ordered .
china presented its strengths in beijing : the ability of an authoritarian government to mobilize people and resources for centrally decided projects .
the ability - if need be - to curtail car traffic for weeks on end and shut down factories in order to get air quality to a somewhat acceptable level .
unfortunately , beijing also showed off its abilities to prevent protests , shield off dissidents and hinder journalists to do their work . the 29th olympic summer games in beijing will possibly go down in history as the " pretense games . "
the international olympic committee pretended that it would be possible to combine the awarding of the games with private lessons in democratization .
the chinese government pretended that it would allow more freedom rights in connection with the games .
china pretended to be a modern , cosmopolitan country that it wants to be seen as .
the olympic organizers pretended to allow demonstrations - even if not a single one was approved and applicants ended up in prison . during the opening ceremony , a beautiful girl pretended to sing - while the voice of another girl had been recorded .
small chinese pretended to be children representing the country 's 55 ethnic minorities - but they 'd only been dressed in colorful costumes . the athletes pretended to break world records without any outside help .
german equestrians even doped their horses !
ioc , organizers , sponsors and media organizations all pretended that the games were a " festival of global youth " when commerce has long been reigning supreme .
the world pretended that an olympic peace existed .
but georgia began invading its breakaway province south ossetia just in time for the opening ceremony . but the games are still a success for the chinese government .
maybe they have n't been the international public relations success beijing had hoped for , but they certainly have been just that domestically .
the gold medal shower , the opening ceremony attended by more world leaders than ever before , the perfect rundown of the competitions from an organizational point of view - all of this was broadcast to every chinese living room .
that strengthens national self-confidence .
it 's precious political capital to legitimize the domination of a party that 's ruined in terms of ideology . the ioc 's the loser .
it naively believed that the democratization boost of the games in seoul , south korea , in 1988 could be realized in beijing as well .
but south korea is a small country that 's dependent on the us in terms of security policy .
china 's a gigantic country that functions according to its own rules . there is a slight slimmer of hope , though and it 's based on a couple of different things .
international pressure , for example , led to a loosening of internet censorship for the duration of the games .
it was n't unlocked completely .
but it was opened up as far as it had never happened before .

" the extent of the use of military force by the russian side appears - seen from here and despite reports to the contrary from georgia and the picture conveyed by the media - not inappropriately high , " brigadier general heinz g wagner wrote on aug .
11 . the german foreign ministry said it did not comment on internal documents . according to the faz report , the general said some three days after the outbreak of hostilities that russia had no choice but to react to the georgian military action in south ossetia . the russian peacekeeping forces stationed in the breakaway georgian region " were not in a position , given their weapons and equipment , to defend themselves effectively or even to resist , " the general wrote . protecting forces ? russia had been compelled to ensure that the land forces of its 58th army were able to move without being threatened by the georgian air force , and for this reason georgian planes had been prevented from intervening , wagner wrote . the russians had moved to strengthen their peacekeepers , deployed under a mandate from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , to protect russian citizens and to restore the status quo ante , the attache said . " the deployment of air power - despite the regrettable civilian casualties - can be seen as militarily appropriate to the operation , " wagner wrote , according to the faz report . wagner 's report contrasted with the official german government position . merkel thinks differently chancellor angela merkel visited tbilisi on aug.17 to offer support to georgian president mikheil saakashvili and call for russia to adhere to the ceasefire agreement signed the previous day by russian president dmitry medvedev . germany demands that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory and has criticized the russian for not sticking to their side of the bargain . merkel also made clear that germany backed ultimate nato membership for georgia . " georgia will become a member if it wants to , " she said . at the nato summit in bucharest in april , germany was one of the countries expressing caution on georgian membership of the western military alliance . the summit decided that georgia and ukraine , another former republic of the defunct soviet union , should not receive membership action plans -lrb- maps -rrb- - the precursor to full membership . nato foreign ministers are to take up the issue at a meeting in december . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the extent of the use of military force by the russian side appears - seen from here and despite reports to the contrary from georgia and the picture conveyed by the media - not inappropriately high , " brigadier general heinz g wagner wrote on aug .
11 . the german foreign ministry said it did not comment on internal documents . according to the faz report , the general said some three days after the outbreak of hostilities that russia had no choice but to react to the georgian military action in south ossetia . the russian peacekeeping forces stationed in the breakaway georgian region " were not in a position , given their weapons and equipment , to defend themselves effectively or even to resist , " the general wrote . protecting forces ? russia had been compelled to ensure that the land forces of its 58th army were able to move without being threatened by the georgian air force , and for this reason georgian planes had been prevented from intervening , wagner wrote . the russians had moved to strengthen their peacekeepers , deployed under a mandate from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , to protect russian citizens and to restore the status quo ante , the attache said . " the deployment of air power - despite the regrettable civilian casualties - can be seen as militarily appropriate to the operation , " wagner wrote , according to the faz report . wagner 's report contrasted with the official german government position . merkel thinks differently chancellor angela merkel visited tbilisi on aug.17 to offer support to georgian president mikheil saakashvili and call for russia to adhere to the ceasefire agreement signed the previous day by russian president dmitry medvedev . germany demands that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory and has criticized the russian for not sticking to their side of the bargain . merkel also made clear that germany backed ultimate nato membership for georgia . " georgia will become a member if it wants to , " she said . at the nato summit in bucharest in april , germany was one of the countries expressing caution on georgian membership of the western military alliance . the summit decided that georgia and ukraine , another former republic of the defunct soviet union , should not receive membership action plans -lrb- maps -rrb- - the precursor to full membership . nato foreign ministers are to take up the issue at a meeting in december . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the war he became a successful architect and sculptor and is bringing his art , dedicated to war-time children , back to germany . in august 1939 , meisler and a group of other children boarded a train at berlin 's friedrichstrasse that was bound for england . meisler , whose parents were jewish , had arrived in berlin from the german port of danzig -lrb- today gdansk -rrb- .
he remembers his aunt adele waiting for him on the station platform to give him a hug and hand him a few bananas - a luxury in those years . a few hours later the youngsters , most of them between five and 17 , continued their journey to the dutch coast to catch a ship bound for harwich in england and then a train to london 's liverpool street station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht in 1938 was a nicht of terror against jews in london , meisler 's grandmother and two aunts who had fled germany in the mid-1930s were waiting to greet him at the station . " i was lucky and was not alone , " meisler said recently in an interview with dpa news agency . many jews sought refuge in vain the so-called " kindertransporte " -lrb- child transports -rrb- to england began in late 1938 after " kristallnacht " in germany left jewish-run shops smashed and 267 synagogues ransacked and set ablaze in the notorious nov .
9 night of nazi terror . terrified by the sudden brutal turn of events , vast numbers of jews desperately sought a country to move to , only to find that entry doors had been slammed on them in many cases . even the us made it difficult for jews , granting entry visas only to those who could provide solid proof of income and wealth . britain was an exception , as far as jewish children were concerned .
ultimately , some 10,000 youngsters would arrive in england via the " kindertransporte " from berlin . meisler offers sculpture to berlin once in london , meisler soon got used to the sounds of sirens and bombing raids when the war began .
he learned english rapidly and would later become a successful architect , helping to design london 's heathrow airport and other big projects . with apartments in london and tel aviv , meisler nowadays shuttles between the two countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friedrichstrasse subway station is in the heart of berlin the architect turned sculptor has been a frequent visitor to berlin of late , where he recently offered to donate a major art work to the city . the bronze sculpture , six square meters in size , depicts children in sombre grey attire , with star of david patches attached to their clothing .
the girls have plaited hair and 1930s-style clothes ; the boys are carrying a few possessions and wearing flat caps . the group symbolizes the 1.5 million jewish children for whom there would be no escape and who would later end up being murdered in the nazi concentration camps along with their parents . separate from this group , two children peer serenely in another direction .
a boy has a small suitcase , a girl a satchel on her back . both look calm and unafraid .
they represent the 10,000 children able to depart a country that no longer wanted them . memorial statues in london , vienna a bronze sculpture of meisler 's is already on display at the liverpool street underground station in london .
inaugurated by britain 's prince charles in 2006 it shows five jewish youngsters with suitcases on rail tracks against a station background . in march this year , a second work of meisler 's devoted to the war-time rescue of jewish children was installed - this time at vienna 's westbahnhof .
it depicts a young boy , lost in his thoughts , sitting on a brown suitcase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meisler lives in england and israel in berlin , the city 's central mitte district authorities were delighted to accept meisler 's more recent " remembrance " sculpture , even agreeing a hand-over date with him and the spot where it is to be installed at the friedrichstrasse station . but berlin government cultural officials were less enamored and initially rejected it .
they found the design somewhat bland , more in keeping with a school outing than a dramatic war-time evacuation . berlin finally approves statue mitte district officials , however , have decided to ignore such official misgivings about the work .
on nov .
30 - 70 years to the day when the first " kindertransporte " to england began , it will be inaugurated . three days after meisler left germany for england , his parents were arrested by the gestapo and later murdered at auschwitz . although he has a lot to do with abstract art , meisler insists that real life-size figures were needed for his latest work .
people using the friedrichstrasse station had to be able to identify with the sculpture , he said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the zephyr-6 , as it is known , stayed aloft for more than three days , running through the night on batteries it had recharged in sunlight .
the flight was a demonstration for the us military , which is looking for new types of technology to support its troops on the ground .
craft like zephyr might make ideal platforms for reconnaissance .
they could also be used to relay battlefield communications .
chris kelleher , from uk defence and research firm qinetiq , said unmanned aerial vehicles -lrb- uavs -rrb- offer advantages over traditional aircraft and even satellites .
" the principal advantage is persistence - that you would be there all the time , " he told bbc news .
" a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day - and one of those is at night - so it 's only really getting a snapshot of activity .
zephyr would be watching all day . "
deployment close the latest flight was conducted at the us army 's yuma proving ground in arizona .
the zephyr flew non-stop for 82 hours , 37 minutes .
that time beats the current official world record for unmanned flight set by the us robot plane global hawk - of 30 hours , 24 minutes - and even zephyr 's own previous best of 54 hours achieved last year .
however , the yuma mark remains " unofficial " because qinetiq did not involve the fai -lrb- federation aeronautique internationale -rrb- , the world air sports federation , which sanctions all record attempts .
the us department of defense funded the demonstration flight under its joint capability technology demonstration -lrb- jctd -rrb- programme .
this programme is designed to advance the technologies american commanders would most like to see in the field .
" we think zephyr is very close to an operational system - within the next two years is what we 're aiming for , " mr kelleher said .
" we have one more step of improvements ; we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months ; and we want to push the performance . "
energy density the trial , which took place between 28 and 31 july , also included the participation of the uk ministry of defence .
the 30kg zephyr was guided by remote control to an operating altitude in excess of 18km -lrb- 60,000ft -rrb- , and then flown on autopilot and via satellite communication .
it tested a communications payload weighing approximately 2kg .
at first sight , the propeller-driven zephyr looks to be just another model aircraft , and it is even launched by hand .
but this " pilotless " vehicle with its 18-metre wingspan incorporates world-leading technologies .
its structure uses ultra-lightweight carbon-fibre material ; and the plane flies on solar power generated by amorphous silicon solar arrays no thicker than sheets of paper .
these are glued over the aircraft 's wings .
to get through the night , the propellers are powered from lithium-sulphur batteries which are topped up during the day .
" a lot of effort has gone into power storage and light-weighting the systems , " explained mr kelleher .
" lithium sulphur is more than double the energy density of the best alternative technology which is lithium polymer batteries .
" they are an exceptional performer .
we 've worked with the sion corporation .
they 've had them in development for years .
we 're actually the first application in the world for them . "
vulture venture zephyr has demonstrated that it can cope with extremes of temperature - from the blistering 45c heat found at ground level in arizona 's sonoran desert , to the minus 70c chill experienced at altitudes of more than 18km -lrb- 60,000ft -rrb- .
the engineers from the farnborough-based company are now collaborating with the american aerospace giant boeing on a defence project codenamed vulture .
this would see the biggest plane in history take to the sky , powered by the sun and capable of carrying a 450-kilo -lrb- 1,000lb -rrb- payload .
us commanders say the design must be able to maintain its position over a particular spot on the earth 's surface uninterrupted for five years .
qinetiq is also developing uav technology for civilian uses .
it has been working recently with aberystwyth university on field monitoring trials , plotting areas of ground that may or may not need fertiliser applications .
lightweight plane -lrb- 30-34kg / 70lb -rrb- is launched by hand coms or surveillance payload of about 2kg -lrb- 4.5lb -rrb- flies autonomously and can climb to more than 18km -lrb- 60,000ft -rrb- by day , zephyr flies on solar power and recharges its batteries advanced amorphous silicon solar arrays supplied by unisolar rechargeable lithium-sulphur batteries supplied by sion corp jonathan.amos-internet @ bbc.co.uk e-mail this to a friend related to this story : robot plane sweeps over uk fields -lrb- 08 aug 08 -pipe- science / nature -rrb- robot hurricane plane 's flight -lrb- 27 may 08 -pipe- technology -rrb- military 's crucial ' eye in the sky ' -lrb- 05 jun 08 -pipe- science / nature -rrb- robots fly into antarctic skies -lrb- 19 mar 08 -pipe- technology -rrb- solar plane flies into the night -lrb- 09 sep 07 -pipe- science / nature -rrb- robot vehicles take on tough jobs -lrb- 10 aug 07 -pipe- technology -rrb- related internet links qinetiq the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

the zephyr-6 , as it is known , stayed aloft for more than three days , running through the night on batteries it had recharged in sunlight .
the flight was a demonstration for the us military , which is looking for new types of technology to support its troops on the ground .
craft like zephyr might make ideal platforms for reconnaissance .
they could also be used to relay battlefield communications .
chris kelleher , from uk defence and research firm qinetiq , said unmanned aerial vehicles -lrb- uavs -rrb- offer advantages over traditional aircraft and even satellites .
" the principal advantage is persistence - that you would be there all the time , " he told bbc news .
" a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day - and one of those is at night - so it 's only really getting a snapshot of activity .
zephyr would be watching all day . "
deployment close the latest flight was conducted at the us army 's yuma proving ground in arizona .
the zephyr flew non-stop for 82 hours , 37 minutes .
that time beats the current official world record for unmanned flight set by the us robot plane global hawk - of 30 hours , 24 minutes - and even zephyr 's own previous best of 54 hours achieved last year .
however , the yuma mark remains " unofficial " because qinetiq did not involve the fai -lrb- federation aeronautique internationale -rrb- , the world air sports federation , which sanctions all record attempts .
the us department of defense funded the demonstration flight under its joint capability technology demonstration -lrb- jctd -rrb- programme .
this programme is designed to advance the technologies american commanders would most like to see in the field .
" we think zephyr is very close to an operational system - within the next two years is what we 're aiming for , " mr kelleher said .
" we have one more step of improvements ; we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months ; and we want to push the performance . "
energy density the trial , which took place between 28 and 31 july , also included the participation of the uk ministry of defence .
the 30kg zephyr was guided by remote control to an operating altitude in excess of 18km -lrb- 60,000ft -rrb- , and then flown on autopilot and via satellite communication .
it tested a communications payload weighing approximately 2kg .
zephyr should be in commanders ' hands within two years at first sight , the propeller-driven zephyr looks to be just another model aircraft , and it is even launched by hand .
but this " pilotless " vehicle with its 18-metre wingspan incorporates world-leading technologies .
its structure uses ultra-lightweight carbon-fibre material ; and the plane flies on solar power generated by amorphous silicon solar arrays no thicker than sheets of paper .
these are glued over the aircraft 's wings .
to get through the night , the propellers are powered from lithium-sulphur batteries which are topped up during the day .
" a lot of effort has gone into power storage and light-weighting the systems , " explained mr kelleher .
" lithium sulphur is more than double the energy density of the best alternative technology which is lithium polymer batteries .
" they are an exceptional performer .
we 've worked with the sion corporation .
they 've had them in development for years .
we 're actually the first application in the world for them . "
vulture venture zephyr has demonstrated that it can cope with extremes of temperature - from the blistering 45c heat found at ground level in arizona 's sonoran desert , to the minus 70c chill experienced at altitudes of more than 18km -lrb- 60,000ft -rrb- .
the engineers from the farnborough-based company are now collaborating with the american aerospace giant boeing on a defence project codenamed vulture .
this would see the biggest plane in history take to the sky , powered by the sun and capable of carrying a 450-kilo -lrb- 1,000lb -rrb- payload .
us commanders say the design must be able to maintain its position over a particular spot on the earth 's surface uninterrupted for five years .
qinetiq is also developing uav technology for civilian uses .
it has been working recently with aberystwyth university on field monitoring trials , plotting areas of ground that may or may not need fertiliser applications .
lightweight plane -lrb- 30-34kg / 70lb -rrb- is launched by hand coms or surveillance payload of about 2kg -lrb- 4.5lb -rrb- flies autonomously and can climb to more than 18km -lrb- 60,000ft -rrb- by day , zephyr flies on solar power and recharges its batteries advanced amorphous silicon solar arrays supplied by unisolar rechargeable lithium-sulphur batteries supplied by sion corp jonathan.amos-internet @ bbc.co.uk e-mail this to a friend printable version bookmark with : delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these ?

before the games , the authorities said protests would be allowed in three designated areas , but it never approved any of the applications to use them .
and rights groups claimed that some people were arrested as they tried to apply for a permit .
olympic chief jacques rogge said in a news conference that the failure to grant any licences to protest was unusual .
as well as eight us citizens , china 's authorities also continue to hold a uk national .
the uk foreign office has already urged china to free 41-year-old mandie mckeown , saying china needed " to respect its commitment to freedom of expression " .
beijing says the activists will be deported on 30 and 31 august .
several other foreign protesters have already been deported .
although the organisation of the games has been widely praised , rights groups have criticised the beijing government throughout .

this year 's winners were dublin-based david o 'doherty , who took the main prize and an £ 8,000 cheque , and sarah millican , from newcastle-upon-tyne , given £ 4,000 to spend as best newcomer .
o 'doherty was rewarded for a show that sees him " waffle a lot " , as he puts it , with an hour of " stupid jokes and songs played on a keyboard i got for my 11th birthday " .
and it was a biting analysis of a painful divorce which earned millican her prize , focusing on " the questions that you ask when you split up with somebody " .
you might expect anyone following in the footsteps of previous winners such as the cambridge footlights , steve coogan and lee evans to be caught up in the moment , act a little bit " showbiz " and appear unbearably smug about their success .
but o 'doherty and millican seem to be two of the most down-to-earth personalities on the comedy circuit , judging by their reaction to their prizes .
newer car instead of being extravagant and coming up with ways to blow their cheques , both say they have debts to clear - " many " in o 'doherty 's case .
millican says she has a loan for a vehicle that is " on its last legs " .
millican had never been to a stand-up gig before her marriage ended " i do n't want the loan to outlast the car , " she said .
" if i can pay it off , i can get a newer car a bit sooner .
it 's really boring - but it 's normal . "
and both seemed humbled by the reaction they received as they walked through the jam house venue after the ceremony , which was attended by several hundred people .
" i got loads of kisses and hugs , " said millican , who was almost bouncing off the walls with excitement backstage .
" it was worth it just for that . "
o 'doherty said a lot of people had been " very good " to him in recent years and he had toured with three former winners of the award - tommy tiernan , dmitri martin and rich hall .
hall , now a well-established act , was one of those to congratulate the irishman afterwards .
" rich had tears in his eyes , " he said .
" that was beautiful . "
new jokes the award meant a lot , o 'doherty added , because for him comedy was " such a struggle " .
" this is a big push for my career , certainly , " he said .
" but really it 's all about rainy nights in november when you 're trying to think of new jokes .
" i do n't know if it 's going to make that any easier , but it might make more people come to see the shows , and that 's good . "
as far as millican is concerned , it was the pain of her recent divorce that , ironically , led her to comedy .
having never even been to a stand-up gig before her marriage ended , she attended a performance workshop before trying five minutes " in a really scary pub in newcastle where they were all sat with their arms folded saying , ' come on then , woman " ' .
" the first half was hard and the second half went really well .
i thought , ' oh , i like this . " '
big sleep her show explores the lack of self-belief and the wounded pride that can be felt after breaking up with a loved one .
" it was things like ' what if i want kids ? ' , ' what if nobody fancies me any more ? ' and all these things that most people have probably thought , " she said .
brendon burns and clive james presented the awards " even if they were n't in a marriage , everybody 's split up with somebody and had all of these horrible thoughts .
i answered mine throughout the course of the show . "
millican says her first fringe has been a great experience and appears to feel the award and the positive reviews were merely a bonus .
" it 's about entertaining the audience .
they 're the people who 've paid their money , " she says .
" if you entertain them , you 've done your job .
the fact that i sold out a lot and got good reviews was amazing in itself . "
o 'doherty says his month in edinburgh has been especially " tough " because he has been performing not just his award-winning routine , but also a children 's act and a satirical midnight show with three other stand-ups .
after three shows a day throughout august , he says he has " a few snots and i do n't quite have my own voice " , but it seems to have been worth it all .
" i 'll be going for a sleep for a week or two after this but my goodness , what an ending to the festival .
it 's fantastic . "

this year 's winners were dublin-based david o 'doherty , who took the main prize and an £ 8,000 cheque , and sarah millican , from newcastle-upon-tyne , given £ 4,000 to spend as best newcomer .
o 'doherty was rewarded for a show that sees him " waffle a lot " , as he puts it , with an hour of " stupid jokes and songs played on a keyboard i got for my 11th birthday " .
and it was a biting analysis of a painful divorce which earned millican her prize , focusing on " the questions that you ask when you split up with somebody " .
you might expect anyone following in the footsteps of previous winners such as the cambridge footlights , steve coogan and lee evans to be caught up in the moment , act a little bit " showbiz " and appear unbearably smug about their success .

millican says she has a loan for a vehicle that is " on its last legs " .
millican had never been to a stand-up gig before her marriage ended " i do n't want the loan to outlast the car , " she said .
" if i can pay it off , i can get a newer car a bit sooner .
it 's really boring - but it 's normal . "
and both seemed humbled by the reaction they received as they walked through the jam house venue after the ceremony , which was attended by several hundred people .
" i got loads of kisses and hugs , " said millican , who was almost bouncing off the walls with excitement backstage .
" it was worth it just for that . "
o 'doherty said a lot of people had been " very good " to him in recent years and he had toured with three former winners of the award - tommy tiernan , dmitri martin and rich hall .
hall , now a well-established act , was one of those to congratulate the irishman afterwards .
" rich had tears in his eyes , " he said .
" that was beautiful . "
new jokes the award meant a lot , o 'doherty added , because for him comedy was " such a struggle " .
" this is a big push for my career , certainly , " he said .
" but really it 's all about rainy nights in november when you 're trying to think of new jokes .
" i do n't know if it 's going to make that any easier , but it might make more people come to see the shows , and that 's good . "
as far as millican is concerned , it was the pain of her recent divorce that , ironically , led her to comedy .
having never even been to a stand-up gig before her marriage ended , she attended a performance workshop before trying five minutes " in a really scary pub in newcastle where they were all sat with their arms folded saying , ' come on then , woman " ' .

millican says her first fringe has been a great experience and appears to feel the award and the positive reviews were merely a bonus .
" it 's about entertaining the audience .
they 're the people who 've paid their money , " she says .
" if you entertain them , you 've done your job .
the fact that i sold out a lot and got good reviews was amazing in itself . "
o 'doherty says his month in edinburgh has been especially " tough " because he has been performing not just his award-winning routine , but also a children 's act and a satirical midnight show with three other stand-ups .
after three shows a day throughout august , he says he has " a few snots and i do n't quite have my own voice " , but it seems to have been worth it all .

" the first half was hard and the second half went really well .
i thought , ' oh , i like this . " '
big sleep her show explores the lack of self-belief and the wounded pride that can be felt after breaking up with a loved one .
" it was things like ' what if i want kids ? ' , ' what if nobody fancies me any more ? ' and all these things that most people have probably thought , " she said .
brendon burns and clive james presented the awards " even if they were n't in a marriage , everybody 's split up with somebody and had all of these horrible thoughts .
i answered mine throughout the course of the show . "
millican says her first fringe has been a great experience and appears to feel the award and the positive reviews were merely a bonus .
" it 's about entertaining the audience .
they 're the people who 've paid their money , " she says .
" if you entertain them , you 've done your job .
the fact that i sold out a lot and got good reviews was amazing in itself . "
o 'doherty says his month in edinburgh has been especially " tough " because he has been performing not just his award-winning routine , but also a children 's act and a satirical midnight show with three other stand-ups .
after three shows a day throughout august , he says he has " a few snots and i do n't quite have my own voice " , but it seems to have been worth it all .
" i 'll be going for a sleep for a week or two after this but my goodness , what an ending to the festival .
it 's fantastic . "

this year 's winners were dublin-based david o 'doherty , who took the main prize and an £ 8,000 cheque , and sarah millican , from newcastle-upon-tyne , given £ 4,000 to spend as best newcomer .
o 'doherty was rewarded for a show that sees him " waffle a lot " , as he puts it , with an hour of " stupid jokes and songs played on a keyboard i got for my 11th birthday " .
and it was a biting analysis of a painful divorce which earned millican her prize , focusing on " the questions that you ask when you split up with somebody " .
you might expect anyone following in the footsteps of previous winners such as the cambridge footlights , steve coogan and lee evans to be caught up in the moment , act a little bit " showbiz " and appear unbearably smug about their success .
but o 'doherty and millican seem to be two of the most down-to-earth personalities on the comedy circuit , judging by their reaction to their prizes .
newer car instead of being extravagant and coming up with ways to blow their cheques , both say they have debts to clear - " many " in o 'doherty 's case .
millican says she has a loan for a vehicle that is " on its last legs " .
millican had never been to a stand-up gig before her marriage ended " i do n't want the loan to outlast the car , " she said .
" if i can pay it off , i can get a newer car a bit sooner .
it 's really boring - but it 's normal . "
and both seemed humbled by the reaction they received as they walked through the jam house venue after the ceremony , which was attended by several hundred people .
" i got loads of kisses and hugs , " said millican , who was almost bouncing off the walls with excitement backstage .
" it was worth it just for that . "
o 'doherty said a lot of people had been " very good " to him in recent years and he had toured with three former winners of the award - tommy tiernan , dmitri martin and rich hall .
hall , now a well-established act , was one of those to congratulate the irishman afterwards .
" rich had tears in his eyes , " he said .
" that was beautiful . "
new jokes the award meant a lot , o 'doherty added , because for him comedy was " such a struggle " .
" this is a big push for my career , certainly , " he said .
" but really it 's all about rainy nights in november when you 're trying to think of new jokes .
" i do n't know if it 's going to make that any easier , but it might make more people come to see the shows , and that 's good . "
as far as millican is concerned , it was the pain of her recent divorce that , ironically , led her to comedy .

the review was requested by council leaders as part of its campaign to save 24-hour cover at windsor station .
it comes after berkshire fire authority agreed last year to cut operating hours and provide a service from slough between 2000 and 0800 bst .
the high court hearing will go ahead on 29 january , 2009 .
the council 's application sought a review on the grounds that the fire authority 's consultation process was flawed .
it claims the decision was based on historical statistics and without proper assessment of future risk in respect of population increases in windsor and slough .
councillor david burbage , leader of the royal borough of windsor and maidenhead , said : " we took the decision to resort to legal action to overturn the fire authority 's decision .
" we want to keep up the fight to safeguard the level of fire cover our residents and visitors to windsor need and deserve . "
the fire authority said the plans were " part of a county-wide programme to improve levels of fire cover where it is most needed " .
