program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.02.2008 outgoing president putin talks tough to the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin claimed that there had been " no serious failures " on his watch russian president vladimir putin went out swinging at his last annual press conference , taking verbal shots at kosovo , nato and election critics .
putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .

" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .

we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.02.2008 german parliament postpones stem cell law decision until march großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists are not allowed to use stem cell lines from after 2002 the debate over changing the laws governing stem cell research in germany prompted a four hour discussion in the german parliament thursday , feb .
14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .

" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "

putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "

but russia and serbia stepped up their rhetorical opposition and threatened they would not cooperate with european efforts . with kosovo likely to declare independence on sunday , feb .
17 , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said he hoped for unity within the 27-nation bloc .
the eu needs to act " in a coherent manner , " barroso said thursday .
it 's likely that most eu countries will quickly recognize the declaration of independence by kosovo leaders , as will the united states .
international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .
" there would be no greater humiliation for serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told the glas javnosti newspaper in an interview .
no major serbian political party accepts secession .
the parties released a document thursday annuling kosovo 's independence in advance .
it declares any acts or activities of provisional authorities to be " null and void " and in breach of united nations regulations .
" this annuls the acts and actions of the interim government of kosovo that proclaim unilateral independence , because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia , " the statement said .
european future serbia is in the midst of bitter political infighting over whether to pursue closer ties with the eu that threatens the coalition government with collapsing just weeks after it was formed .
kostunica said all other disagreements must be put aside until kosovo has been sorted out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is ready for independence the eu has said it wants to see serbia begin talks which could eventually lead to full membership in the bloc .
" we want to show to kosovo and serbia that their future is with us , " barroso said thursday .
" and we would like that any developments in the situation are managed properly and without creating more turbulence in an area that is already a very sensitive one , " barroso said .
almost nine years ago , nato bombed serbian forces to put an end to a wave of killings in a two-year war between serbia and kosovo rebels .
kosovo has been under un stewardship since 1999 .
kosovo has 2 million people , about 90 percent ethnic albanians .
approximately 120,000 serbs remain in the country .
the eu is likely to send a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to kosovo to ensure the rule of law .
serbia , russia ready to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns about violence remain both serbia and russia have secret plans ready in case the west recognizes kosovo 's independence .
neither have said what those plans might be .
" serbia has the right ... and serbia will continue , through a series of concrete steps , to ... prove that kosov is part of serbia , " kostunica told a news conference .
putin called the unilateral declaration of independence " immoral and illegal . "
putin said russia has a plan in place if kosovo declares independence , but did n't give any hint as to what form of action would be taken .
he said russia would not follow europe 's lead and recognize the independence of two pro-moscow separatist territories in neighboring georgia .
" if someone takes an idiotic and illegal decision , this does n't mean we should do the same , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.02.2008 berlin to lead massive bail-out for subprime-hit bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the subprime housing market crisis in the us has buffeted banks across the atlantic germany has agreed on a 1.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- rescue package for subprime-hit bank ikb , the third bail-out for the ailing institution .
one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . another state-owned group , bayernlb , also confirmed wednesday that it had a hole in its accounts totalling nearly two billion euros .
the sum was dwarfed by the 11.5 billion euros in losses at ikb .
ikb , which lends mainly to industry to build factories , unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages and lost . " incalculable consequences " " after lengthy talks we have decided to do all we can to save ikb , " german economy minister michael glos said after a meeting of the supervisory board of kfw . finance minister steinbrueck warned against allowing ikb to go bankrupt .
a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money . " it is intolerable that the taxpayers should be paying this bill , " michael fuchs , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told london 's financial times . germany 's media has also been critical of the government rescue package , saying the banks themselves are responsible for the mess they created and that it was n't fair to prop up a discredited public sector financial industry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .

" while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.02.2008 opinion : integration does n't mean assimilation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has confused integration with assimilation for too long , says dw 's peter philipp .
germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .
immigrants are encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and introduce it into canadian society .
this means that canada is constantly in a state of development and change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp these are just two examples of many .
in both cases , the immigrants are integrated and take on a role in society .
in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "
it 's impossible to reason with an argument like that .
the factory worker from anatolia , the doctor from iran or the asylum-seeker from africa wo n't suddenly start reading german literature or cooking german food . it 's unrealistic to assume even " the germans " do that themselves . forced assimilation does n't work integration means that everyone in a given country has a part in the whole , no matter where they come from or which religion they believe in .
assimilation , however , is an individual decision to adapt . problems arise when states try to force minorities to adapt - as the turks have done to the kurds .
even complete assimilation does n't protect minorities from hostility or persecution - as experienced by jews in nazi germany . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .
immigrants are encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and introduce it into canadian society .
this means that canada is constantly in a state of development and change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp these are just two examples of many .
in both cases , the immigrants are integrated and take on a role in society .
in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "
it 's impossible to reason with an argument like that .
the factory worker from anatolia , the doctor from iran or the asylum-seeker from africa wo n't suddenly start reading german literature or cooking german food . it 's unrealistic to assume even " the germans " do that themselves . forced assimilation does n't work integration means that everyone in a given country has a part in the whole , no matter where they come from or which religion they believe in .
assimilation , however , is an individual decision to adapt . problems arise when states try to force minorities to adapt - as the turks have done to the kurds .
even complete assimilation does n't protect minorities from hostility or persecution - as experienced by jews in nazi germany . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .

international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .
" there would be no greater humiliation for serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told the glas javnosti newspaper in an interview .
no major serbian political party accepts secession .
the parties released a document thursday annuling kosovo 's independence in advance .
it declares any acts or activities of provisional authorities to be " null and void " and in breach of united nations regulations .
" this annuls the acts and actions of the interim government of kosovo that proclaim unilateral independence , because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia , " the statement said .
european future serbia is in the midst of bitter political infighting over whether to pursue closer ties with the eu that threatens the coalition government with collapsing just weeks after it was formed .
kostunica said all other disagreements must be put aside until kosovo has been sorted out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is ready for independence the eu has said it wants to see serbia begin talks which could eventually lead to full membership in the bloc .
" we want to show to kosovo and serbia that their future is with us , " barroso said thursday .
" and we would like that any developments in the situation are managed properly and without creating more turbulence in an area that is already a very sensitive one , " barroso said .
almost nine years ago , nato bombed serbian forces to put an end to a wave of killings in a two-year war between serbia and kosovo rebels .
kosovo has been under un stewardship since 1999 .
kosovo has 2 million people , about 90 percent ethnic albanians .
approximately 120,000 serbs remain in the country .
the eu is likely to send a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to kosovo to ensure the rule of law .
serbia , russia ready to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns about violence remain both serbia and russia have secret plans ready in case the west recognizes kosovo 's independence .
neither have said what those plans might be .
" serbia has the right ... and serbia will continue , through a series of concrete steps , to ... prove that kosov is part of serbia , " kostunica told a news conference .
putin called the unilateral declaration of independence " immoral and illegal . "
putin said russia has a plan in place if kosovo declares independence , but did n't give any hint as to what form of action would be taken .
he said russia would not follow europe 's lead and recognize the independence of two pro-moscow separatist territories in neighboring georgia .
" if someone takes an idiotic and illegal decision , this does n't mean we should do the same , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "
additionally , russia will not target any country with nuclear missiles except in " extreme necessity , " putin said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . another state-owned group , bayernlb , also confirmed wednesday that it had a hole in its accounts totalling nearly two billion euros .
the sum was dwarfed by the 11.5 billion euros in losses at ikb .
ikb , which lends mainly to industry to build factories , unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages and lost . " incalculable consequences " " after lengthy talks we have decided to do all we can to save ikb , " german economy minister michael glos said after a meeting of the supervisory board of kfw . finance minister steinbrueck warned against allowing ikb to go bankrupt .
a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money . " it is intolerable that the taxpayers should be paying this bill , " michael fuchs , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told london 's financial times . germany 's media has also been critical of the government rescue package , saying the banks themselves are responsible for the mess they created and that it was n't fair to prop up a discredited public sector financial industry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also seek to increase the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . the trade union has refused the offer , claiming that its members would lose ground with such a deal , given the inflation rate of close to 3 percent a year . employers have accused the unions of pushing for a strike rather than working toward a negotiated solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.02.2008 outgoing president putin talks tough to the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin claimed that there had been " no serious failures " on his watch russian president vladimir putin went out swinging at his last annual press conference , taking verbal shots at kosovo , nato and election critics .
putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "

they also seek to increase the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . the trade union has refused the offer , claiming that its members would lose ground with such a deal , given the inflation rate of close to 3 percent a year . employers have accused the unions of pushing for a strike rather than working toward a negotiated solution . " we have the feeling that it 's all running according to a script , " manfred hoffmann , the head of the municipal employers ' association , said .

but russia and serbia stepped up their rhetorical opposition and threatened they would not cooperate with european efforts . with kosovo likely to declare independence on sunday , feb .
17 , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said he hoped for unity within the 27-nation bloc .
the eu needs to act " in a coherent manner , " barroso said thursday .
it 's likely that most eu countries will quickly recognize the declaration of independence by kosovo leaders , as will the united states .
international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .
" there would be no greater humiliation for serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told the glas javnosti newspaper in an interview .
no major serbian political party accepts secession .
the parties released a document thursday annuling kosovo 's independence in advance .
it declares any acts or activities of provisional authorities to be " null and void " and in breach of united nations regulations .
" this annuls the acts and actions of the interim government of kosovo that proclaim unilateral independence , because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia , " the statement said .
european future serbia is in the midst of bitter political infighting over whether to pursue closer ties with the eu that threatens the coalition government with collapsing just weeks after it was formed .
kostunica said all other disagreements must be put aside until kosovo has been sorted out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is ready for independence the eu has said it wants to see serbia begin talks which could eventually lead to full membership in the bloc .
" we want to show to kosovo and serbia that their future is with us , " barroso said thursday .
" and we would like that any developments in the situation are managed properly and without creating more turbulence in an area that is already a very sensitive one , " barroso said .
almost nine years ago , nato bombed serbian forces to put an end to a wave of killings in a two-year war between serbia and kosovo rebels .
kosovo has been under un stewardship since 1999 .
kosovo has 2 million people , about 90 percent ethnic albanians .
approximately 120,000 serbs remain in the country .
the eu is likely to send a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to kosovo to ensure the rule of law .
serbia , russia ready to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns about violence remain both serbia and russia have secret plans ready in case the west recognizes kosovo 's independence .
neither have said what those plans might be .
" serbia has the right ... and serbia will continue , through a series of concrete steps , to ... prove that kosov is part of serbia , " kostunica told a news conference .
putin called the unilateral declaration of independence " immoral and illegal . "
putin said russia has a plan in place if kosovo declares independence , but did n't give any hint as to what form of action would be taken .
he said russia would not follow europe 's lead and recognize the independence of two pro-moscow separatist territories in neighboring georgia .
" if someone takes an idiotic and illegal decision , this does n't mean we should do the same , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.02.2008 opinion : integration does n't mean assimilation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has confused integration with assimilation for too long , says dw 's peter philipp .
germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .
immigrants are encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and introduce it into canadian society .
this means that canada is constantly in a state of development and change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp these are just two examples of many .
in both cases , the immigrants are integrated and take on a role in society .
in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "
it 's impossible to reason with an argument like that .
the factory worker from anatolia , the doctor from iran or the asylum-seeker from africa wo n't suddenly start reading german literature or cooking german food . it 's unrealistic to assume even " the germans " do that themselves . forced assimilation does n't work integration means that everyone in a given country has a part in the whole , no matter where they come from or which religion they believe in .
assimilation , however , is an individual decision to adapt . problems arise when states try to force minorities to adapt - as the turks have done to the kurds .
even complete assimilation does n't protect minorities from hostility or persecution - as experienced by jews in nazi germany . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .

a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money .

there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de speculation grows over blair 's ambitions for eu president role even before the lisbon treaty was signed , speculation was rife as to who would be the first european president as proposed in the new document .
now it is signed and sealed , one man heads the list of potential candidates .

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "
additionally , russia will not target any country with nuclear missiles except in " extreme necessity , " putin said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.02.2008 outgoing president putin talks tough to the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin claimed that there had been " no serious failures " on his watch russian president vladimir putin went out swinging at his last annual press conference , taking verbal shots at kosovo , nato and election critics .
putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.02.2008 german parliament postpones stem cell law decision until march großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists are not allowed to use stem cell lines from after 2002 the debate over changing the laws governing stem cell research in germany prompted a four hour discussion in the german parliament thursday , feb .
14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .
germany 's 69 catholic bishops repeated thursday their strict opposition to research on the embryonal cells . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german parliament to discuss reforming stem cell law some scientists and politicians believe the 2002 law restricting the use of stem cells in german research is no longer in sync with modern medicine .

the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .

"
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .

she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "
additionally , russia will not target any country with nuclear missiles except in " extreme necessity , " putin said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .

" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .

kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .

" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "

" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .

it 's likely that most eu countries will quickly recognize the declaration of independence by kosovo leaders , as will the united states .
international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .
" there would be no greater humiliation for serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told the glas javnosti newspaper in an interview .
no major serbian political party accepts secession .
the parties released a document thursday annuling kosovo 's independence in advance .
it declares any acts or activities of provisional authorities to be " null and void " and in breach of united nations regulations .
" this annuls the acts and actions of the interim government of kosovo that proclaim unilateral independence , because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia , " the statement said .
european future serbia is in the midst of bitter political infighting over whether to pursue closer ties with the eu that threatens the coalition government with collapsing just weeks after it was formed .
kostunica said all other disagreements must be put aside until kosovo has been sorted out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is ready for independence the eu has said it wants to see serbia begin talks which could eventually lead to full membership in the bloc .
" we want to show to kosovo and serbia that their future is with us , " barroso said thursday .
" and we would like that any developments in the situation are managed properly and without creating more turbulence in an area that is already a very sensitive one , " barroso said .
almost nine years ago , nato bombed serbian forces to put an end to a wave of killings in a two-year war between serbia and kosovo rebels .
kosovo has been under un stewardship since 1999 .
kosovo has 2 million people , about 90 percent ethnic albanians .
approximately 120,000 serbs remain in the country .
the eu is likely to send a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to kosovo to ensure the rule of law .

putin called the unilateral declaration of independence " immoral and illegal . "
putin said russia has a plan in place if kosovo declares independence , but did n't give any hint as to what form of action would be taken .

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .
immigrants are encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and introduce it into canadian society .
this means that canada is constantly in a state of development and change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp these are just two examples of many .
in both cases , the immigrants are integrated and take on a role in society .
in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "
it 's impossible to reason with an argument like that .
the factory worker from anatolia , the doctor from iran or the asylum-seeker from africa wo n't suddenly start reading german literature or cooking german food . it 's unrealistic to assume even " the germans " do that themselves . forced assimilation does n't work integration means that everyone in a given country has a part in the whole , no matter where they come from or which religion they believe in .
assimilation , however , is an individual decision to adapt . problems arise when states try to force minorities to adapt - as the turks have done to the kurds .
even complete assimilation does n't protect minorities from hostility or persecution - as experienced by jews in nazi germany . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.02.2008 berlin to lead massive bail-out for subprime-hit bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the subprime housing market crisis in the us has buffeted banks across the atlantic germany has agreed on a 1.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- rescue package for subprime-hit bank ikb , the third bail-out for the ailing institution .
one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . another state-owned group , bayernlb , also confirmed wednesday that it had a hole in its accounts totalling nearly two billion euros .
the sum was dwarfed by the 11.5 billion euros in losses at ikb .
ikb , which lends mainly to industry to build factories , unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages and lost . " incalculable consequences " " after lengthy talks we have decided to do all we can to save ikb , " german economy minister michael glos said after a meeting of the supervisory board of kfw . finance minister steinbrueck warned against allowing ikb to go bankrupt .
a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money . " it is intolerable that the taxpayers should be paying this bill , " michael fuchs , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told london 's financial times . germany 's media has also been critical of the government rescue package , saying the banks themselves are responsible for the mess they created and that it was n't fair to prop up a discredited public sector financial industry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . another state-owned group , bayernlb , also confirmed wednesday that it had a hole in its accounts totalling nearly two billion euros .
the sum was dwarfed by the 11.5 billion euros in losses at ikb .
ikb , which lends mainly to industry to build factories , unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages and lost . " incalculable consequences " " after lengthy talks we have decided to do all we can to save ikb , " german economy minister michael glos said after a meeting of the supervisory board of kfw . finance minister steinbrueck warned against allowing ikb to go bankrupt .
a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money . " it is intolerable that the taxpayers should be paying this bill , " michael fuchs , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told london 's financial times . germany 's media has also been critical of the government rescue package , saying the banks themselves are responsible for the mess they created and that it was n't fair to prop up a discredited public sector financial industry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .

the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .

in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 14.02.2008 berlin to lead massive bail-out for subprime-hit bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the subprime housing market crisis in the us has buffeted banks across the atlantic germany has agreed on a 1.5 billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- rescue package for subprime-hit bank ikb , the third bail-out for the ailing institution .
one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . another state-owned group , bayernlb , also confirmed wednesday that it had a hole in its accounts totalling nearly two billion euros .
the sum was dwarfed by the 11.5 billion euros in losses at ikb .
ikb , which lends mainly to industry to build factories , unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages and lost . " incalculable consequences " " after lengthy talks we have decided to do all we can to save ikb , " german economy minister michael glos said after a meeting of the supervisory board of kfw . finance minister steinbrueck warned against allowing ikb to go bankrupt .
a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money . " it is intolerable that the taxpayers should be paying this bill , " michael fuchs , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told london 's financial times . germany 's media has also been critical of the government rescue package , saying the banks themselves are responsible for the mess they created and that it was n't fair to prop up a discredited public sector financial industry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russia and serbia stepped up their rhetorical opposition and threatened they would not cooperate with european efforts . with kosovo likely to declare independence on sunday , feb .
17 , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said he hoped for unity within the 27-nation bloc .
the eu needs to act " in a coherent manner , " barroso said thursday .
it 's likely that most eu countries will quickly recognize the declaration of independence by kosovo leaders , as will the united states .
international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .
" there would be no greater humiliation for serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told the glas javnosti newspaper in an interview .
no major serbian political party accepts secession .
the parties released a document thursday annuling kosovo 's independence in advance .
it declares any acts or activities of provisional authorities to be " null and void " and in breach of united nations regulations .
" this annuls the acts and actions of the interim government of kosovo that proclaim unilateral independence , because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia , " the statement said .
european future serbia is in the midst of bitter political infighting over whether to pursue closer ties with the eu that threatens the coalition government with collapsing just weeks after it was formed .
kostunica said all other disagreements must be put aside until kosovo has been sorted out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is ready for independence the eu has said it wants to see serbia begin talks which could eventually lead to full membership in the bloc .
" we want to show to kosovo and serbia that their future is with us , " barroso said thursday .
" and we would like that any developments in the situation are managed properly and without creating more turbulence in an area that is already a very sensitive one , " barroso said .
almost nine years ago , nato bombed serbian forces to put an end to a wave of killings in a two-year war between serbia and kosovo rebels .
kosovo has been under un stewardship since 1999 .
kosovo has 2 million people , about 90 percent ethnic albanians .
approximately 120,000 serbs remain in the country .
the eu is likely to send a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to kosovo to ensure the rule of law .
serbia , russia ready to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns about violence remain both serbia and russia have secret plans ready in case the west recognizes kosovo 's independence .
neither have said what those plans might be .
" serbia has the right ... and serbia will continue , through a series of concrete steps , to ... prove that kosov is part of serbia , " kostunica told a news conference .
putin called the unilateral declaration of independence " immoral and illegal . "
putin said russia has a plan in place if kosovo declares independence , but did n't give any hint as to what form of action would be taken .
he said russia would not follow europe 's lead and recognize the independence of two pro-moscow separatist territories in neighboring georgia .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .

here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.02.2008 outgoing president putin talks tough to the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin claimed that there had been " no serious failures " on his watch russian president vladimir putin went out swinging at his last annual press conference , taking verbal shots at kosovo , nato and election critics .
putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .

but russia and serbia stepped up their rhetorical opposition and threatened they would not cooperate with european efforts . with kosovo likely to declare independence on sunday , feb .
17 , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said he hoped for unity within the 27-nation bloc .
the eu needs to act " in a coherent manner , " barroso said thursday .
it 's likely that most eu countries will quickly recognize the declaration of independence by kosovo leaders , as will the united states .
international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .
" there would be no greater humiliation for serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told the glas javnosti newspaper in an interview .
no major serbian political party accepts secession .
the parties released a document thursday annuling kosovo 's independence in advance .
it declares any acts or activities of provisional authorities to be " null and void " and in breach of united nations regulations .
" this annuls the acts and actions of the interim government of kosovo that proclaim unilateral independence , because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia , " the statement said .
european future serbia is in the midst of bitter political infighting over whether to pursue closer ties with the eu that threatens the coalition government with collapsing just weeks after it was formed .
kostunica said all other disagreements must be put aside until kosovo has been sorted out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is ready for independence the eu has said it wants to see serbia begin talks which could eventually lead to full membership in the bloc .
" we want to show to kosovo and serbia that their future is with us , " barroso said thursday .
" and we would like that any developments in the situation are managed properly and without creating more turbulence in an area that is already a very sensitive one , " barroso said .
almost nine years ago , nato bombed serbian forces to put an end to a wave of killings in a two-year war between serbia and kosovo rebels .
kosovo has been under un stewardship since 1999 .
kosovo has 2 million people , about 90 percent ethnic albanians .
approximately 120,000 serbs remain in the country .
the eu is likely to send a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to kosovo to ensure the rule of law .
serbia , russia ready to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns about violence remain both serbia and russia have secret plans ready in case the west recognizes kosovo 's independence .
neither have said what those plans might be .
" serbia has the right ... and serbia will continue , through a series of concrete steps , to ... prove that kosov is part of serbia , " kostunica told a news conference .
putin called the unilateral declaration of independence " immoral and illegal . "
putin said russia has a plan in place if kosovo declares independence , but did n't give any hint as to what form of action would be taken .
he said russia would not follow europe 's lead and recognize the independence of two pro-moscow separatist territories in neighboring georgia .
" if someone takes an idiotic and illegal decision , this does n't mean we should do the same , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .

here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .
immigrants are encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and introduce it into canadian society .
this means that canada is constantly in a state of development and change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp these are just two examples of many .
in both cases , the immigrants are integrated and take on a role in society .
in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "
it 's impossible to reason with an argument like that .
the factory worker from anatolia , the doctor from iran or the asylum-seeker from africa wo n't suddenly start reading german literature or cooking german food . it 's unrealistic to assume even " the germans " do that themselves . forced assimilation does n't work integration means that everyone in a given country has a part in the whole , no matter where they come from or which religion they believe in .
assimilation , however , is an individual decision to adapt . problems arise when states try to force minorities to adapt - as the turks have done to the kurds .
even complete assimilation does n't protect minorities from hostility or persecution - as experienced by jews in nazi germany . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .

one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . another state-owned group , bayernlb , also confirmed wednesday that it had a hole in its accounts totalling nearly two billion euros .
the sum was dwarfed by the 11.5 billion euros in losses at ikb .
ikb , which lends mainly to industry to build factories , unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages and lost . " incalculable consequences " " after lengthy talks we have decided to do all we can to save ikb , " german economy minister michael glos said after a meeting of the supervisory board of kfw . finance minister steinbrueck warned against allowing ikb to go bankrupt .
a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money . " it is intolerable that the taxpayers should be paying this bill , " michael fuchs , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told london 's financial times . germany 's media has also been critical of the government rescue package , saying the banks themselves are responsible for the mess they created and that it was n't fair to prop up a discredited public sector financial industry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but russia and serbia stepped up their rhetorical opposition and threatened they would not cooperate with european efforts . with kosovo likely to declare independence on sunday , feb .
17 , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said he hoped for unity within the 27-nation bloc .
the eu needs to act " in a coherent manner , " barroso said thursday .
it 's likely that most eu countries will quickly recognize the declaration of independence by kosovo leaders , as will the united states .
international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .

" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu .

" the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.02.2008 german parliament postpones stem cell law decision until march großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists are not allowed to use stem cell lines from after 2002 the debate over changing the laws governing stem cell research in germany prompted a four hour discussion in the german parliament thursday , feb .
14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder . " the person has to be gifted but not too flashy and encourage and cajole eu leaders with the force of his or her personality and powers of persuasion to drive forward the eu 's agenda , " said brady . competing posts but it 's not just the horserace character of who could fill the position that 's raised worries in the eu .
even before the job has officially been created , there are concerns that its exact mandate remains vague and that it faces a rival in the form of yet another post formulated by the lisbon treaty - that of a european foreign minister , which bolsters a foreign policy job currently held by javier solana . formally called the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , the post will be endowed with significantly more power and resources than the foreign policy chief now possesses , since the new eu diplomatic chief will work both for national governments and the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . " there is no doubt that there will be tensions there because the two posts will overlap in some areas , " said brady . no decisions until at least 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eu politicians and experts say blair stands little to no chance for the post names of possible contenders for the post of eu president read like a " who 's who " of eu politicians past and present . middle east peace envoy and former british prime minister tony blair , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , luxembourg prime minister and chairman of the finance ministers of the euro zone jean-claude juncker and foreign policy chief solana have all been named as potential eu frontmen . first though , all the eu 's 27 member states need to ratify the lisbon treaty , a stripped-down version of the eu constitution that was killed off by french and dutch voters .
ratification is expected to be completed by the end of this year - most countries will be rushing through the treaty in their respective parliaments rather than taking it to their voters - and the new president will only be elected sometime in 2009 . the answer to kissinger 's question might well be a while in coming . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

workers , mainly in hospitals throughout germany , began warning strikes early thursday , feb .
14 . the strike began at 3:30 a.m. on thursday when the early shift in hospitals in saarland , germany 's smallest state , did n't start work .
thousands more workers followed suit in bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , with more strikes expected elsewhere throughout the day , according to germany 's powerful trade union verdi . the union had called on its 1.3 million members employed in the public services sector to initiate warning strikes in support of an 8-percent increase in wages after a third round of talks ended without resolution on tuesday . town halls , child daycare centers , garbage collection services and state savings banks are among the institutions impacted by the strikes , which could continue for several more days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals are particularly affected by the warning strikes hospitals are particularly affected , though a doctor 's union said it would not be joining in the strikes .

they also seek to increase the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . the trade union has refused the offer , claiming that its members would lose ground with such a deal , given the inflation rate of close to 3 percent a year . employers have accused the unions of pushing for a strike rather than working toward a negotiated solution . " we have the feeling that it 's all running according to a script , " manfred hoffmann , the head of the municipal employers ' association , said .
he added that he had received information that trade unions , despite talks taking place at the time , were planning strikes last week . the parties are to resume talks on feb .
25 , before which verdi said it wanted to " put some real pressure on , " according to leni breymaier , the union 's head for the state of baden-wuerttemberg . strike crippled commute in berlin at the beginning of february , verdi called on berlin 's public transport workers to strike , which saw buses , trams and underground trains halt for 39 hours .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .

putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "

most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "
additionally , russia will not target any country with nuclear missiles except in " extreme necessity , " putin said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .
immigrants are encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and introduce it into canadian society .
this means that canada is constantly in a state of development and change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp these are just two examples of many .
in both cases , the immigrants are integrated and take on a role in society .
in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "
it 's impossible to reason with an argument like that .
the factory worker from anatolia , the doctor from iran or the asylum-seeker from africa wo n't suddenly start reading german literature or cooking german food . it 's unrealistic to assume even " the germans " do that themselves . forced assimilation does n't work integration means that everyone in a given country has a part in the whole , no matter where they come from or which religion they believe in .
assimilation , however , is an individual decision to adapt . problems arise when states try to force minorities to adapt - as the turks have done to the kurds .
even complete assimilation does n't protect minorities from hostility or persecution - as experienced by jews in nazi germany . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans should stop expecting immigrants to become like them . both the united states and canada are immigrant countries with professed immigration policies , but with entirely different methods of taking in new residents . the us has fostered the " melting pot " principle for a long time - perhaps too long .
immigrants should adapt to the majority and adopt their supposedly shared way of life , while leaving behind the culture that had shaped them thus far .
the " american way of life " has become a model to strive for . canada , on the other hand , consciously conducts a policy of multiculturalism .
immigrants are encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and introduce it into canadian society .

in both cases , the immigrants are integrated and take on a role in society .
in the us , they also undergo a process of adaptation , while in canada they help to form the society . avoiding the reality in germany , the situation is different .
here , people pretended germany is not a country of immigration , even though the recruitment of guest workers created the basis to become one . even when guest workers started to settle in germany , raise children and acquire german citizenship , the majority population still neglected to integrate these people into society .
instead , they accuse the immigrants of preferring to live in a parallel society rather than integrate . but this attitude has more to do with assimilation than with integration .
the latter involves two elements : the person who wants to integrate and take on a role in society and the society that is ready to accept the person . without coming out and saying it , people have expected immigrants to assimilate rather than integrate .
this has brought into being the term " deutsche leitkultur , " which roughly translates to " mainstream german culture . " " if immigrants want a place in our society , then they should become just like us . "
it 's impossible to reason with an argument like that .

assimilation , however , is an individual decision to adapt . problems arise when states try to force minorities to adapt - as the turks have done to the kurds .

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .
yet , confusion over the presidency 's role , limited power and another competing job might weaken eu efforts to inject clarity into its structures , experts say . " the face of the eu " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is meant to simplify and stream-line the eu according to the lisbon treaty , the new office-holder will be the standing president of the european council , the body made up of each nation 's leaders .
he or she will be elected by serving heads of state for a two-and-a-half-year term , which will be renewable once .
the president will prepare and chair all summits , ending the current system that sees nations taking six-month turns to preside over eu leaders ' gatherings . " the new president will be the face of the eu , " said sarah seeger from the munich-based center for applied policy research .
" someone who european citizens can identify with and third countries can turn to when they want to deal with the eu . " while the idea of a single point man for brussels speaking on behalf of nearly half a billion citizens will spark a sigh of relief in capitals outside europe , closer to home , the new president is expected to ease the pressures of running an eu which has nearly doubled in size in the last four years . some smaller states are left struggling with the huge task of managing the bloc 's complex agenda , while big ones are sometimes accused of mixing national priorities with eu interests . " the aim is to have a new president who will inject a new dynamic in big eu summits and improve the coherence of eu decision-making , " said hugo brady of the center for european reform in london . " the fact that the person will have a long office term and will be divorced from national mandates will allow him or her to cobble together common eu positions . " speaking with one voice the inability to speak with a unified voice has hobbled the eu in the past , most notably during the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , when the bloc witnessed a damaging split over whether to support the war .
a strong representative figure at the helm of the eu will boost the bloc 's diplomatic clout , some say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of german and france led europe 's opposition to the iraq war when it started " such a post would have made sense during the iraq crisis , " said sebastian kurpas of the brussels-based center for european policy studies .
" it probably would n't have eliminated all the differences but you could have avoided the strong language and style that led to tensions back then . " experts agree the new president needs to be a consensus-builder .

putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic accomplishments . putin might be nearing the end of his time as president , but he 's in no danger of becoming irrelevant .
after elections in two weeks , it 's likely that putin will take on a powerful new role as prime minister if his hand-chosen presidential successor is voted into office in two weeks .
it 's widely assumed that first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev will win the upcoming march 2 elections .
more than 1,300 journalists packed the kremlin 's round hall for putin 's seventh and final annual press conference on thursday , feb .
14 .
putin spoke on a raised platform between two giant television screens .
he started the news conference by using statistics to describe russia 's economic boom .
" i do not see any serious failures , " putin told a questioner .
" all the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved " .
stepping down , but not bowing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe believes the elections are undemocratic putin , 55 , claims he never considered trying to change russia 's constitution to allow him to serve more than two consecutive terms as president .
putin said it would be " absolutely unacceptable " for him to stay in power .
" everyone must obey the law , first and foremost the head of the state , " putin said .
" it 's necessary not to shed tears that this period of work has finished but instead be glad for the opportunity to take up a new post in which to serve my country . "
prime ministers under putin have had little power , but that is about to change .
putin said he understood the prime minister 's responsibilities to include creating the budget as well as dealing with social questions , security and foreign policy .
" i know how the head of state 's job is set up , and assure you that our relations will be quite harmonious .
i will never step in for the head of the government .
i consider that damaging and counter-productive , " putin said .
no personal gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 's proud of russia 's economic progress putin also dismissed the suggestion that he 's used the presidency to become one of europe 's wealthiest men .
reports have suggested putin has made tens of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- during his presidency .
putin said it 's " nonsense " to suggest that he has profited behind the scenes from russia 's oil wealth .
he does n't collect money , but " emotions , " he said . the overwhelming support of the russian people is his " greatest wealth , " putin said .
unworried about election criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has putin 's backing the west has criticized the upcoming march 2 election as undemocratic , saying that moscow has stifled the opposition .
" the fact it 's going on quietly without debates , slowly , around the country does not speak to a lack of democracy in the country , " putin said .
" rather it speaks to the fact that a wide majority of the citizens of russia support the chosen course . "
europe 's security and human rights watchdog , the osce , decided against sending observers to monitor the election , citing restrictions russian officials placed on its monitors .
putin criticized the osce of trying to " teach " russia how to behave .
" let them teach their wives to make cabbage soup , " he said .
" we will not let anyone force any conditions on us . "
kosovo independence " immoral " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural resources are in high demand the president did not mince any words on his disapproval of independence for kosovo , calling the idea " immoral and illegal . "
the serbian province is expected to declare unilateral independence in a matter of weeks .
most european union countries have promised to recognize kosovo independence .
russia has backed serbia 's view that it has the legal right to maintain control of the southern province .
" the territorial integrity of states is enshrined in the principles of international law , " putin said .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , after a nato air attack drove out serbian forces who were fighting against separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters .
putin said europeans have " double standards " on the issue .
" i do n't want say anything that would offend anyone , but for 40 years northern cyprus has practically had independence , " putin said .
" why are n't you recognizing that ?
are n't you ashamed , europeans , for having these double standards ? "
putin threatens to train missiles on ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia remains an important military power putin also said russia would target missiles at ukraine if its national security came under threat .
if ukraine , which wants to join nato , were to host nato bases or elements of a missile shield advocated by the us , russia would be " forced to aim missiles at those targets which we feel threaten our national security , " putin said .
" i am obliged to say this clearly and honestly .
we do not want such a development of events , " he told journalists at his annual kremlin press conference .
so far there have been no plans for ukraine to host such facilities .
russia views the possible expansion of the nato military alliance , as well as a proposal to install an anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic .
on wednesday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice called russia 's threats towards the ukraine " reprehensible " and " unacceptable . "
putin dismisses cold war rhetoric despite his unequivocal opposition to nato expansion and kosovo independence , putin said he was not trying to foment a new confrontation with the west .
" to suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the cold war is just too bold a supposition , " putin said .
" we are not interested in this .
our main tasks are internal development , the solution of social and economic problems of the country . "
additionally , russia will not target any country with nuclear missiles except in " extreme necessity , " putin said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

often seen as remote and technocratic by its own citizens , the eu is set to have a face next year when it gets its first president .
who will be " mr. europe , " and what will the job involve ?
there are no easy answers . " who do i call , if i want to talk to europe ? " former us secretary of state henry kissinger famously asked in the 1970s , in a reference to the eu 's notoriously unwieldy structures and faceless bureaucracy .
decades later , the european union may finally be close to the answer . the new reform treaty agreed upon by leaders from the bloc 's 27 member countries last october in lisbon to streamline decision-making and boost efficiency also created the post of an eu president .

one leader said its collapse would have " incalculable " consequences . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said on wednesday , feb .
13 , that the rescue package involved 1.5 billion euros in financial aid , of which the federal government would take on one billion euros .
he said he was counting on german banks to put up the remaining 500 million euros .
the massive cash injection marks the first time the german government has stepped in directly to prop up a casualty of the subprime loan crisis in the us which has buffeted banks in europe since last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dusseldorf-based ikb unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . another state-owned group , bayernlb , also confirmed wednesday that it had a hole in its accounts totalling nearly two billion euros .
the sum was dwarfed by the 11.5 billion euros in losses at ikb .
ikb , which lends mainly to industry to build factories , unwisely hedged with near-worthless us mortgages and lost . " incalculable consequences " " after lengthy talks we have decided to do all we can to save ikb , " german economy minister michael glos said after a meeting of the supervisory board of kfw . finance minister steinbrueck warned against allowing ikb to go bankrupt .
a collapse would have " threatened a huge loss of trust in germany 's financial reputation , " he said , adding that it would trigger a guarantee mechanism that would spread the bank failure across the entire financial sector . " the potential fallout from an ikb insolvency is incalculable , " he said .
steinbrueck added that the bail-out would have no additional impact on germany 's 2008 budget but would have reverberations in the next years . bail-out criticized the government is expected to open talks with private german banks in the coming days and urge them to step up to rescue ikb . news of the government bail-out has angered some politicians who have accused chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of squandering taxpayers ' money . " it is intolerable that the taxpayers should be paying this bill , " michael fuchs , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told london 's financial times . germany 's media has also been critical of the government rescue package , saying the banks themselves are responsible for the mess they created and that it was n't fair to prop up a discredited public sector financial industry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .

but russia and serbia stepped up their rhetorical opposition and threatened they would not cooperate with european efforts . with kosovo likely to declare independence on sunday , feb .
17 , european commission chief jose manuel barroso said he hoped for unity within the 27-nation bloc .
the eu needs to act " in a coherent manner , " barroso said thursday .
it 's likely that most eu countries will quickly recognize the declaration of independence by kosovo leaders , as will the united states .
international unity is far from guaranteed , with russia and serbia heightened their rhetorical opposition to independence .
even within the eu , some member states , notably slovakia , cyprus , spain and romania have expressed reservations about kosovo 's independence .
barroso said all eu member states agree that the current situation is unsustainable .
the eu is likely to send a mission to kosovo which would be designed to help the country transition to full independence .
serbia and russia were loathe to accept an eu-led mission , leaders of both countries said thursday .
" humiliation " for serbia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu has said it will send a team to kosovo serbia called the idea humiliating and said it would not cooperate .
" there would be no greater humiliation for serbia if it , in any way , signed or agreed in some indirect way to this puppet state , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told the glas javnosti newspaper in an interview .
no major serbian political party accepts secession .
the parties released a document thursday annuling kosovo 's independence in advance .
it declares any acts or activities of provisional authorities to be " null and void " and in breach of united nations regulations .
" this annuls the acts and actions of the interim government of kosovo that proclaim unilateral independence , because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia , " the statement said .
european future serbia is in the midst of bitter political infighting over whether to pursue closer ties with the eu that threatens the coalition government with collapsing just weeks after it was formed .
kostunica said all other disagreements must be put aside until kosovo has been sorted out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is ready for independence the eu has said it wants to see serbia begin talks which could eventually lead to full membership in the bloc .
" we want to show to kosovo and serbia that their future is with us , " barroso said thursday .
" and we would like that any developments in the situation are managed properly and without creating more turbulence in an area that is already a very sensitive one , " barroso said .
almost nine years ago , nato bombed serbian forces to put an end to a wave of killings in a two-year war between serbia and kosovo rebels .
kosovo has been under un stewardship since 1999 .
kosovo has 2 million people , about 90 percent ethnic albanians .
approximately 120,000 serbs remain in the country .
the eu is likely to send a 1,800-strong police and justice mission to kosovo to ensure the rule of law .
serbia , russia ready to act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns about violence remain both serbia and russia have secret plans ready in case the west recognizes kosovo 's independence .
neither have said what those plans might be .
" serbia has the right ... and serbia will continue , through a series of concrete steps , to ... prove that kosov is part of serbia , " kostunica told a news conference .
putin called the unilateral declaration of independence " immoral and illegal . "
putin said russia has a plan in place if kosovo declares independence , but did n't give any hint as to what form of action would be taken .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.02.2008 german parliament postpones stem cell law decision until march großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists are not allowed to use stem cell lines from after 2002 the debate over changing the laws governing stem cell research in germany prompted a four hour discussion in the german parliament thursday , feb .
14 as lawmakers addressed one of science 's most sensitive issues . as pressure grows for an easing of restrictions that local scientists complain prevent them from keeping up with global advances , the bundestag tackled the stem cell question , one which carries the historic overtones of the nazis ' genetic experiments linked to the creation of a " master race " .
the debate over whether to change the law which was passed six years ago banning the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines and which also barred german scientists from working on any lines created after jan.1 2002 raged for most of the morning without coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
instead , a vote on whether the law should be changed was scheduled for mid-march .
researchers in germany have complained that the tight laws in effect in their country prevents them from taking part in international projects using stem cell lines created after the current law was introduced in 2002 .
other european countries , such as britain and sweden , have less strict laws .
stem cell law faces many possible amendments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the most likely change is an extension of the cut-off date the vote in march could present a number of different scenarios , from tightening the rules and banning all imports of stem cells to lifting the ban altogether .
there is also a chance that the law will remain how it is with no changes made .
however , the proposal which has won most support from lawmakers so far is one which introduces a more recent cut-off date , probably may 2007 , for the import of stem cell lines .
traumatized by grisly experiments on humans under the nazis and influenced by its christian churches , germany has agonized for a decade about the ethics of using the cells .
critics , who argue that a human life is sacrificed when an embryo is torn apart , have welcomed newly invented ways to re-program adult stem cells to make them pluripotent , or capable of acting like embryonal cells .
but scientists said they still need embryonal cells to compare with these induced pluripotent cells .
german researchers at a disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do not have the freedom of other scientists the amendment to the law is being demanded by 184 out of 613 deputies , supported by science minister annette schavan , who said during the four-hour debate that it was " ethically responsible . "
" you have to take account of the fact that researchers need qualitatively better cells , " technology minister annette schavan told german television shortly before the debate , adding she wanted to ensure german scientists could keep up globally .
a group of 129 oppose any change .
priska hinz , greens science spokeswoman , said claims that embryonal research would save lives had never been borne out .
she said scientists could make do with adult cells and did not need a new law .
" the desire to heal serious diseases through embryonic stem cell research is only a wish , " she said .
" there is no argument for killing human life for science , " said hubert hueppe , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who wants to tighten the rules .

however , jeppesen had said it could not confirm if it was involved with the flights .

mrs obama has been articulate and passionate the 2008 campaign has seen the role of the political spouse reshaped , with potential first ladies - and one possible first gentleman - more than ever acting as independent surrogates for their partners .
the past 12 months have seen michelle obama emerge as a formidable campaigner for her husband , drawing large crowds to her own scheduled events .
outspoken , articulate , and independently minded , she has been widely seen as an asset to the obama campaign .
the 44-year-old ivy league lawyer has taken a much edgier role than the other candidates ' wives : not shying away from going on the offensive where necessary .
she recently launched a scathing attack on hillary clinton , saying she represented " the same old thing over and over again . "
key role she has not , however , gone as far as bill clinton , whose controversial role as hillary 's bad cop has drawn criticism from senior members of his own party .
there is no formal job description for a first lady at the white house possibly because a woman for the first time stands a chance of winning the nomination for a major us party , spouses have seized the opportunity to express themselves and weigh in on issues .
mrs obama - who has taken time out from her high-powered job as a hospital administrator in chicago - has been a crucial element in her husband 's campaign to win over key voting groups , such as working women and african-americans .
her experience of growing up in a working-class black chicago neighbourhood could been seen as more typical of the african-american experience than that of her husband , providing more connection with black working-class voters .
her speeches have resonated with issues of race and the prejudice she encountered in her early years .
unlike barack , who has largely tried to avoid talking about race , mrs obama has raised the flag for the " little black girls " and highlighted " disparities that exist across the country . "
asset or liability but she never forgets her own two young children , ensuring that voters know that she is home every night in time to put them to bed .
michelle obama brilliantly frames what she says within a safe , nurturing framework robert p watson , presidential historian this is a very modern marriage , and the senator 's wife has often spoken of juggling the demands of being a professional , a mother and wife of a politician who is away from home for long periods .
a community activist , she has described herself as committed to public service .
" michelle obama has been fantastic on the stump , " says robert p watson , professor of american history at lynn university in florida , and the author of a number of books on the history of first ladies .
" she has great political instincts . "
however , such spouse visibility can be either an asset or a liability .
in 2004 , teresa heinz kerry publicly waded into areas of policy and quickly became seen as a risk within camp kerry .
traditional mr watson says that mrs obama has been careful to avoid discussing policy and strategy .
cindy mccain has played a more traditional , supporting role " she is a remarkably savvy operator , " he says .
" she brilliantly frames what she says within a safe , nurturing framework .
much of what she says comes through the eyes of a mother with two young children - in a way that does n't really allow her to be a target . "
mrs obama has said that politics is not her passion and that her role is to complement her husband 's campaign .
cindy mccain , wife of the republican front-runner john mccain , has complemented her husband 's campaign by playing a more traditional , supporting role .
she has , however , been more outspoken than she was in her husband 's 2000 campaign .
a " military mom " with two sons in active service , she has criticised the bush administration for what she says is its mishandling of the iraq war .
but , she has resisted taking policy positions or criticising other candidates publicly .
the 53-year-old former arizona rodeo beauty queen is seen as an asset to her husband 's campaign , having long overcome the humiliating public exposure of her former addiction to prescription painkillers .
potential turf war the mother of four is a philanthropist and businesswomen in her own right .
in 2000 , she took over as chairman of her father 's multi-million dollar budweiser distribution company .
eleanor roosevelt broke new ground as an active first lady mrs mccain has said that if she were to become first lady , she would continue her overseas volunteer work and encourage others to do so .
what do americans expect from their first ladies ?
there is no formal job description , although the first lady does get an office , a budget and staff .
" over the years , first ladies have been white house managers , white house hostesses , white house renovators , co-campaigners , social activists and policy advocates , " says mr watson .
former president mr clinton would break new ground as " first gentleman " , and questions have been raised about who would really run the affairs of the country if hillary clinton got into office .
' finger on the pulse ' while mrs clinton has suggested that he might play the role of ambassador to the world , some commentators have suggested this could potentially spark a small turf war with a new secretary of state .
bill and hillary clinton : two for one again ?
given her biography , one would expect mrs obama to be a active first lady .
mr watson says that she does have the capacity to " re-write the books " .
but , he said that the issue of her being the first african-american first lady was a sensitive one and that she could " face a more difficult balancing act " .
" i expect there would be public pressure for her to pull back , " he says .
for example , he thinks it would be unlikely that she would break new ground and continue to work .
" first ladies have to have their fingers on the pulse of public opinion , " he says .
the public , however , are never entirely sure about what they want from a first lady .
" if she 's independent , we 're wary .
if she 's a prop , that 's worse .
a big career is an asset , unless she wo n't give it up , " june kronholz once wrote in the wall street journal .
eleanor roosevelt used her influence as an active first lady to campaign for human rights , among other things .
and hillary clinton moved the first lady 's office to the heart of power in the west wing .
but mr watson says mrs roosevelt and mrs clinton both faced criticism after they left .
" the country suffered ' eleanor fatigue ' and ' hillary fatigue ' , " he says .
but , he said , first ladies are always criticised for either trying to do too much or doing too little .
" it 's a case of damned if you do , damned if you do n't . "
laura bush , who took over from mrs clinton , has been a more traditional first lady .
the expectation is that mrs mccain will follow suit .
she has said that she thinks the " american voter wants a traditional situation . "
when asked recently what her " first lady platform " would be , mrs obama appeared wary of revealing too much .
" to make sure my kids have their heads on straight , " she said .

outspoken , articulate , and independently minded , she has been widely seen as an asset to the obama campaign .
the 44-year-old ivy league lawyer has taken a much edgier role than the other candidates ' wives : not shying away from going on the offensive where necessary .
she recently launched a scathing attack on hillary clinton , saying she represented " the same old thing over and over again . "
key role she has not , however , gone as far as bill clinton , whose controversial role as hillary 's bad cop has drawn criticism from senior members of his own party .
there is no formal job description for a first lady at the white house possibly because a woman for the first time stands a chance of winning the nomination for a major us party , spouses have seized the opportunity to express themselves and weigh in on issues .
mrs obama - who has taken time out from her high-powered job as a hospital administrator in chicago - has been a crucial element in her husband 's campaign to win over key voting groups , such as working women and african-americans .
her experience of growing up in a working-class black chicago neighbourhood could been seen as more typical of the african-american experience than that of her husband , providing more connection with black working-class voters .
her speeches have resonated with issues of race and the prejudice she encountered in her early years .
unlike barack , who has largely tried to avoid talking about race , mrs obama has raised the flag for the " little black girls " and highlighted " disparities that exist across the country . "

mrs obama has said that politics is not her passion and that her role is to complement her husband 's campaign .
cindy mccain , wife of the republican front-runner john mccain , has complemented her husband 's campaign by playing a more traditional , supporting role .

what do americans expect from their first ladies ?
there is no formal job description , although the first lady does get an office , a budget and staff .
" over the years , first ladies have been white house managers , white house hostesses , white house renovators , co-campaigners , social activists and policy advocates , " says mr watson .
former president mr clinton would break new ground as " first gentleman " , and questions have been raised about who would really run the affairs of the country if hillary clinton got into office .
' finger on the pulse ' while mrs clinton has suggested that he might play the role of ambassador to the world , some commentators have suggested this could potentially spark a small turf war with a new secretary of state .
bill and hillary clinton : two for one again ?
given her biography , one would expect mrs obama to be a active first lady .
mr watson says that she does have the capacity to " re-write the books " .
but , he said that the issue of her being the first african-american first lady was a sensitive one and that she could " face a more difficult balancing act " .
" i expect there would be public pressure for her to pull back , " he says .
for example , he thinks it would be unlikely that she would break new ground and continue to work .
" first ladies have to have their fingers on the pulse of public opinion , " he says .
the public , however , are never entirely sure about what they want from a first lady .
" if she 's independent , we 're wary .

and hillary clinton moved the first lady 's office to the heart of power in the west wing .
but mr watson says mrs roosevelt and mrs clinton both faced criticism after they left .
" the country suffered ' eleanor fatigue ' and ' hillary fatigue ' , " he says .
but , he said , first ladies are always criticised for either trying to do too much or doing too little .
" it 's a case of damned if you do , damned if you do n't . "

the expectation is that mrs mccain will follow suit .

it made a full-year loss of 4.4bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 4bn ; £ 2.02bn -rrb- during 2007 , compared with a net profit of 12.3bn swiss francs in 2006 .

ubs management warned that it expected 2008 to be a difficult year for the firm and the industry as a whole .
restructure struggle the annual loss was the first since ubs was created from the merger of union bank of switzerland and swiss bank corporation in 1998 .
the firm had warned of its poor performance two weeks ago - including $ 18.4bn of writedowns .
and it has now also unveiled an extra $ 26.6bn in exposure to risky mortgages .
however these are seen as being of less risk than sub-prime loans , which were lent to us homebuyers on low incomes or with patchy credit ratings .

it made a full-year loss of 4.4bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 4bn ; £ 2.02bn -rrb- during 2007 , compared with a net profit of 12.3bn swiss francs in 2006 .
the us sub-prime problems have hit the balance sheets of banks worldwide .
ubs management warned that it expected 2008 to be a difficult year for the firm and the industry as a whole .
restructure struggle the annual loss was the first since ubs was created from the merger of union bank of switzerland and swiss bank corporation in 1998 .
the firm had warned of its poor performance two weeks ago - including $ 18.4bn of writedowns .
and it has now also unveiled an extra $ 26.6bn in exposure to risky mortgages .
however these are seen as being of less risk than sub-prime loans , which were lent to us homebuyers on low incomes or with patchy credit ratings .
these investments quickly soured as higher interest rates pushed up mortgage payments and triggered a wave of defaults .
losses at ubs were far worse than many analysts had expected and the firm is now struggling to restructure its investment banking division to reduce risk and repair its damaged reputation , and it has sought funds from singapore and the middle east .
the crisis in the us housing market and ensuing credit turmoil has also hit other big western banking giants , including wall street giants merrill lynch , citigroup and jp morgan chase , and bnp paribas , france 's biggest bank .

more than 21,000 calls were made to the scottish domestic abuse helpline -lrb- sdah -rrb- last year , an increase of 3 % on 2006 .

some of the youngsters wanted to get help for their mothers .
the helpline said the problem affected people from all parts of scotland regardless of age , background and social class . "
the calls are not just about physical abuse , many were in relation to psychological or emotional abuse " liz kelly sdah the communities minister stewart maxwell is now calling for more to be done to tackle domestic abuse .
he said : " while we have made progress in changing attitudes and encouraging women to report domestic abuse , there is still a lot more work to do in tackling this problem .
" the helpline is an important partner for us in tackling domestic abuse and their help has transformed the lives of many women and their children .
he said it was important that people were encouraged to seek help and report incidents to the police so the true extent of the problem could be discovered and perpetrators properly punished .
helpline number liz kelly , head of training at the sdah , said : " we have had calls that range from people looking for immediate help to get out of a relationship because of domestic abuse , women looking for refuge accommodation , women who need urgent medical attention or who want to report incidents of domestic abuse to the police .
" the calls are not just about physical abuse , many were in relation to psychological or emotional abuse , which was highlighted by the scottish government 's awareness campaign . "
the scottish domestic abuse helpline number is 0800 027 1234 and lines are open 24 hours and calls are free , confidential and can not be traced .

the drive of the queen elizabeth school in mansfield is being developed to create a drop-off bay and new car park .
nearby resident brenda jones said the trees had been a magnet for local birds and she was angry about the felling .
trustee of the school john carter said the drive needed to be widened for the safety of pupils .
' shocked and sad ' he added that the trees will be replaced with the same number of semi-mature lime specimens .
" i 'm shocked and sad to see them go but i ca n't run away from the fact that the school was built for 600 pupils and now we have 1200 pupils .
" a consultation took place through the local authority and notices were served to all neighbours , " mr carter said .
resident brenda jones , argued that the 100-year-old trees should not have been felled .
" the school should look after those trees not agree to have them cut down .
" there were owls going there , all the birds and it 's absolutely criminal .
they are beautiful when they 're in full bloom , " she said .

it says more children carry weapons , but children 's minister kevin brennan said knife incidents remain " rare " .
two-thirds of the 319 children surveyed said bullying was getting worse .
mr morgan , who is based at the education watchdog ofsted , said : " bullying was once considered the domain of the school playground .

and about four out of 10 youngsters said they had been victims of electronic bullying , such as receiving a threatening text message or mobile phone call .
bullying can also include having an embarrassing photo taken and circulated via the internet or mobile phones , as well as " happy slapping " , where attacks are filmed .
the report found social networking websites have become a means for bullies to target their victims .
research suggested that the most common types of bullying experienced by children were name-calling and being hit .
' permanent exclusion ' about a quarter of those who had been bullied were coping by talking to an adult , the report said .
however , the report also found four out of 10 children and young people never worried about bullying .
children 's minister kevin brennan said the report provided " a valuable insight into the views and perceptions of vulnerable children .
" it is important that we listen to their opinions , learn from their experiences and carefully consider what they have told us , " he said .
the minister added : " we agree that bullies must be held to account for their actions and we have given teachers and heads hard-hitting powers to crack down on bullying , including permanent exclusion . "
